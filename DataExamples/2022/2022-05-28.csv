The defender has been one of the best in Italy in this campaign and Juve has followed him closely.

He signed a contract extension with Torino last season but it will not stop them from cashing in on him and they seem close to doing that.

Despite interest from Juve Tuttomercatoweb claims Inter has reached an agreement with him worth 3m euros per season and they just have to agree with Inter for his signature now.

Juve FC Says

Bremer has been a great defender and he would be good to add to our squad in this summer transfer window especially as we lose Giorgio Chiellini.

However Torino will always choose to sell a player to another club instead of Juve and we shouldn’t be surprised that he is leaning towards Inter.

We can still sign the Brazilian if we can get him to agree to join us instead but time is running out on us achieving that.

We probably need to turn our focus to other transfer targets now and see which other defender we can add to the squad in the summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3Zpc2lvbi5jby51Zy9jYXRlZ29yeS9uZXdzL3NpZGUtaHVzdGxlLWJ1c2luZXNzLWVhcm5zLW11d2FpcmEtc2hzMjNtLW1vbi0xMzUwNDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Side hustle business earns Muwaira shs2.3m monthly,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.newvision.co.ug', port=443): Read timed out.

For a village already packed full of desirable buildings from cute stone cottages to fine Palladium townhouses Grade I listed Beacon House is pretty special. It certainly doesn’t disappoint on the aesthetics front at least.

The £3 million price tag however will be enough to make most of us wince. Adam Locke from agents Hamptons of Painswick describes Beacon House as “the centrepiece of the town.”

It certainly has excellent lineage if you’re into that sort of thing. It was believed to have been designed by the eminent architect of the period John Wood the Younger in about 1766.

To those not in the know he was quite a big deal back in day. His designs were highly influential during the 18th century.

He reached great fame by designing many of what are now regarded as some of the UK’s most prestigious properties predominantly in Bath such as The Royal Crescent Queens Square and The Circus to name a few. There has been very little ‘knocking this house into shape’ over the centuries and it remains authentic in every way without appearing museum-like.

First and foremost this is a lovely home just supremely more opulent elegant and statesman-like than many of us will ever experience. The plasterwork – or should that be rococo plaster decoration - here is out of this world.

“It is” said Mr Locke “said to be the best plasterwork in private hands outside the National Trust.” Nowhere are the breath-taking features of this fine house seen in more abundance than in the grand entrance hall.

The detailed Rococo plasterwork which runs throughout the house is in all its full glory in the hall with a vast array of intricate detailing adorning the walls and ceilings that lead up to the first-floor gallery landing via the mahogany staircase. All the principal rooms enjoy individual features and styling and retain an original layout including the kitchen and dining room on the ground floor and drawing room and withdrawing room on the first floor.

Later additions saw the enlargement of the house which also provided a more convivial layout with large and open rooms such as the kitchen/breakfast room and charming garden room with doors to the rear terrace and gardens.

It's a sumptuous house in every regard and on the market for £3m with Hamptons Sales Painswick.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott seemingly blamed mass shootings on mental health at a press conference last week.

However he cut funding for the department that oversees mental health services in Texas experts told CNN.

A mental health non-profit has ranked Texas second to last for access to mental health care.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott blamed the Uvalde school shooting on mental health but cut close to $2o million from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission which oversees mental health services CNN reported.

In a press conference on Wednesday Abbott attributed the rise in mass shootings to mental-health challenges. However it's not known if the 18-year-old gunman who killed 19 children and two adults had a history of mental illness.

""There is no known mental-health history of the gunman"" Abbott said during that conference.

However he still seemingly blamed mass shootings on mental health.

""What I do know in talking to the leaders here as well as leaders around the state one thing that has substantially changed is the status of mental health in our communities"" he said. ""We as a state we as a society need to do a better job with mental health.""

Lori Post director of the Buehler Center for Health Policy and Economics at the Northwestern University School of Medicine told NBC News that there's ""no evidence the shooter is mentally ill just angry and hateful.""

""While it is understandable that most people cannot fathom slaughtering small children and want to attribute it to mental health it is very rare for a mass shooter to have a diagnosed mental health condition"" she told the outlet.

CNN's Pamela Brown reported that despite Abbott's assertion that the issue is tied to mental health he's cut more than $117 million from the state's Health and Human Services Commission in 2021 to a little more than $93 million in 2022.

Across the two years more than $200 million was cut from the departments funds to go towards supporting the National Guard and efforts on the border per the outlet.

The governor's office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment but told CNN that Abbott has spent his time in office working with legislators to support mental health initiatives in the state.

Mental Health America a non-profit tracking mental health resources across the country however ranked Texas 50 out of 51 territories for mental health access in 2021. It also ranked 15 for adults and 30 for youth — indicating that it had high prevalence of mental health illnesses but limited care.

Brown addressed Texas's mental health rankings compared to several mass shootings in the state in recent years alongside loosening gun laws.







Before Uvalde there were mass shootings at a Walmart in El Paso in 2019 Santa Fe High School in 2018 and the Texas First Baptist Church in 2017 among several others.

Abbott on Wednesday said that 18 year olds have been able to buy long guns for 60 years.

""Why is it for the majority of those 60 years we did not have school shootings? And why is it that we do now?"" Abbott said.

However lawmakers and advocates across the country have criticized loose gun laws for mass shootings.

Post told NBC News that Texas has the highest gun per capita rate and Abbott's efforts to curb mass shootings following the 2019 El Paso shooting only led to more bills that ""involved arming the public to stop mass shooters.""

There is catharsis even Schadenfreude to be found in hours-long interrogations of malfeasant government officials or corporate executives embroiled in scandal but the glitchy COVID-safe versions of such events transform the oak-panelled reckonings beneath vaulted ceilings into just another Zoom meeting. This disconnect was evident on Wednesday when the House Committee on Energy and Commerce convened a hearing on the communication breakdowns lack of foresight and gross negligence that contributed to the ongoing baby-formula shortage across the United States. The frantic parents and hungry babies afflicted by the crisis—which has dragged on for months and which will continue for weeks at least—are the rare constituency that can inspire bipartisan outrage in Congress. But it’s hard to project righteous indignation from your living room or in the case of one committee member what looked like the front seat of a car.

The time line of the catastrophe beggars belief. Abbott Nutrition a subdivision of the multinational health conglomerate Abbott Laboratories controlled at least forty per cent of the baby-formula market in the U.S. and it makes about forty per cent of that formula at a single facility in Sturgis Michigan. On September 20 2021 the Food and Drug Administration was made aware of a baby who had contracted a bacterial infection caused by Cronobacter sakazakii after consuming formula made at the Sturgis plant. Coincidentally that same day as Politico’s Helena Bottemiller Evich later reported F.D.A. inspectors were conducting a routine check of the facility. They registered no major safety issues although they did recommend “voluntary action” to address cleanliness and sanitation. Then in October a former employee at the Sturgis plant sent a shocking whistle-blower report to senior officials at the F.D.A. It alleged that Abbott had falsified records shipped untested and potentially contaminated formula permitted lax cleaning practices and concealed information from F.D.A. inspectors. (Abbott which is investigating the report said that the whistle-blower was a former employee who after being “dismissed due to serious violations of Abbott’s food safety policies” made “evolving new and escalating allegations to multiple authorities.”) The whistle-blower report was in the F.D.A.’s possession for months before reaching top officials. A new F.D.A. inspection of the Sturgis plant did not commence until January 31 2022.

Finally on February 17th Abbott shut down the Sturgis plant and issued a voluntary recall of certain lots of three of its formula brands after four babies who consumed Abbott products got bacterial infections in Minnesota Ohio and Texas. Two of the babies later died. Abbott denied that its products were to blame; strangely part of the company’s defense has been that each baby consumed a different formula product from the Sturgis plant and that they were sickened at different times. The F.D.A.’s January inspection uncovered five strains of Cronobacter there.

That single facility which remains closed accounted for about twenty per cent of the entire domestic supply of baby formula including Similac (which in the baby-formula wars is the Coke to Enfamil’s Pepsi) and EleCare a specialized formula for children with food allergies and digestive ailments. The immediate effects of the shutdown and its near-immediate knock-on effects on the rest of the formula market were obvious. Pandemic-era supply-chain problems had already left many store shelves empty of formula by the beginning of 2022 as the Wall Street Journal reported a month before the Sturgis plant went down. Abbott is the major formula supplier to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) whose recipients constitute more than half of the domestic formula market; according to Truthout “Abbott Nutrition is the sole provider of infant formula for U.S. government aid programs in 34 states seven Indian tribal organizations four territories and Washington D.C.” By early spring accounts proliferated of parents driving around for hours to find formula rationing supplies or even substituting water or homemade formula. Pediatricians reported seeing more patients with weight loss. Listings on eBay reportedly offered cases of formula for hundreds of dollars apiece. Robert Ford the chairman and chief executive of Abbott later acknowledged that some children who rely on EleCare were hospitalized.

Somehow widespread stories of desperate parents unable to feed their infants did not inspire immediate federal action. On May 18th three months after the Sturgis plant closure President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to compel suppliers of formula ingredients to prioritize deliveries to formula manufacturers and authorized Pentagon-contracted commercial aircraft to fly in formula from overseas. The same day the House passed a supplemental appropriations bill giving the F.D.A. twenty-eight million dollars in emergency funds to address the shortage. (A hundred and ninety-two Republicans voted against the bill including Morgan Griffith of Virginia a member of the Energy and Commerce committee who asked during Wednesday’s hearing why the F.D.A. and Abbott were not “working at breakneck speed” to address the crisis.) Asked at a press conference whether the Administration could have taken steps sooner Biden replied “If we’d been better mind readers I guess we could have but we moved as quickly as the problem became apparent to us.” (Abbott has a consent decree with the F.D.A. for a reopening of the Sturgis plant tentatively slated for June 4th; from that point it would take another four to eight weeks for formula produced there to hit store shelves.)

As several committee members pointed out on Wednesday the meltdown at Sturgis is likely microcosmic of systemic ongoing issues at Abbott which in 2010 recalled millions of units of Similac produced at the Sturgis plant after beetles and their larvae were found in the product. Stunningly Christopher Calamari a senior vice-president at Abbott claimed at the hearing that he did not know of the whistle-blower’s October report until late April when Representative Rosa DeLauro a Democrat from Connecticut shared it with the public. Kathleen Rice a Democratic congresswoman from New York State elicited the most memorable response when she repeatedly pressed Calamari on why the company had to rely on a whistle-blower to reveal safety shortcomings at a Michigan facility. “Representative” Calamari replied “this um the nature of this um process is um this um when it was made public it was um was shared with F.D.A. and I was not um directly aware of the investigation until that time.”

The report is ghastly reading. The plant the whistle-blower wrote periodically failed to properly seal cans of formula and as a work-around performed safety tests on empty cans instead. He alleged that he was expected to fudge quality-evaluation procedures and that some equipment at the Sturgis plant had been in disrepair for years which “caused product flowing through the pipes to pick up the bacteria that was trapped in the defective areas of the pipe.” The whistle-blower also detailed a patchy record-keeping system maintained largely on paper; a member of management allegedly suggested to him “that electronic records would make the Sturgis site more accountable to others at the division and corporate level.” The report also pointed to shortcomings in the F.D.A.’s inspection process. In 2019 the Sturgis plant produced a batch of formula that tested positive for microorganisms; in response the report claims that Abbott destroyed only the part of the batch that it deemed contaminated and released the rest to market. That same year the plant passed an F.D.A. safety audit. A member of management the whistle-blower claims “volunteered that she was amazed that the F.D.A. was unable to discover what occurred with the micro batches.”

Abbott and the F.D.A. are curious counterparts in this debacle: one an unfathomably profitable multinational corporation; the other a short-staffed perpetually embattled agency that nonetheless has at least the nominal heft of the federal government behind it. According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in October 2019 Abbott’s board of directors authorized stock buybacks of up to three billion dollars; in December 2021 Abbott approved another buyback of up to five billion. One wonders what that money could’ve done for the pockmarked pipes at Sturgis. Meanwhile the F.D.A. as Bottemiller Evich recently reported has “repeatedly failed to take timely action on a wide range of safety and health issues . . . including dangerous pathogens found in water used to grow produce and heavy metal contamination in baby foods” as well as “numerous other chemicals of concern including PFAS so-called forever chemicals which can be found in the food supply and are used in food packaging.” Last year a House subcommittee published an alarming report highly critical of the F.D.A. with a to-the-point title: “Baby Foods Are Tainted with Dangerous Levels of Arsenic Lead Cadmium and Mercury.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9wb2xpdGljcy9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLWZhbHNlLXZpcmFsLXR3ZWV0cy10ZXhhcy1zaG9vdGluZy1hYmJvdHQtY3J1ei9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFkaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9wb2xpdGljcy9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLWZhbHNlLXZpcmFsLXR3ZWV0cy10ZXhhcy1zaG9vdGluZy1hYmJvdHQtY3J1eg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fact check: Debunking false viral tweets about Abbott and Cruz after Texas mass shooting,"CNN —

In the wake of the Tuesday mass shooting at an elementary school in Texas Twitter users went viral by making false claims about two of the state’s most prominent politicians: Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz both Republicans.

False claim about a threat from Abbott’s office

On Thursday a Twitter account going by the handle “My Cancer Journey” posted a three-tweet tale that was shared tens of thousands of times by others on Twitter before it was deleted.

The tweets purported to be written by someone whose nephew was shot in the massacre at Robb Elementary School. The tweets claimed that an Abbott representative knocked on their door shortly after they returned home from identifying their nephew’s body and that this representative “informed us he’s willing to pay us to stand with the Gov and say we don’t need stronger gun laws.”

The tweets claimed that the governor’s representative then threatened them with “charges and possibly worse” if they spoke about the conversation – then that the representative even said that “people get hurt and disappear all the time.”

In total the three tweets were retweeted or quote-tweeted more than 67000 times and liked more than 240000 times. Many of these shares were from liberals opposed to Abbott and Cruz. While some wondered if the story was real or not others took it as authentic.

Facts First: The viral story about Abbott is fake. The “My Cancer Journey” account deleted the three viral tweets on Friday then the account was taken offline entirely. The man behind the account insisted in a brief Friday phone interview with CNN that an unknown person who had somehow gained access to the account had posted the tweets as a “hoax.” But the man refused to explain a series of past tweets from long before the Uvalde massacre in which he made a wide variety of other sensational and highly dubious claims about his life.

Abbott spokesperson Renae Eze said in an email: “This did not happen and would never be allowed to happen.” She said Abbott would never permit a staffer to show up unannounced at a grieving family’s door in the first place.

Speaking Friday in a distraught tone the man behind the account claimed that he and an attorney were trying to figure out who was the real poster of the tweets. He also claimed that they had reported the supposed account intrusion to “authorities” he did not identify.

Rachel Millman the social media editor at New York publication Observer did much of the research into the history of suspect claims from the “My Cancer Journey” account. Various others on Twitter also raised questions about the account before CNN reached the man on Friday.

False claim about Cruz’s tweets

Another Twitter user accused Cruz of having tweeted the exact same three sentences after 12 different mass shootings changing only the location each time.

This tweet from a user who goes by “chavito” on Twitter and rap stage name Cali Kev generated more than 17000 retweets and quote-tweets plus more than 43000 likes.

“Chavito” wrote “These mass shootings happen so much that Ted Cruz really got a template ready to tweet whenever they occur” – adding an expletive and calling the situation “wild.”

The viral tweet featured a collage of 12 images that showed Cruz supposedly tweeting the same words over and over: “Heidi & I are fervently lifting up in prayer the children and families in the horrific shooting in [location]. We are in close contact with local officials but the precise details are still unfolding. Thank you to heroic law enforcement & first responders for acting so swiftly.”

Facts First: Eleven of the 12 supposed Cruz tweets in the viral collage are fake. Cruz did tweet those three sentences after the mass shooting in Uvalde but not after any other incident.

The man behind the “chavito” account did not respond to a request for comment. Cruz’s office confirmed that the senator tweeted this message in response to the Uvalde massacre but not in response to any others.

Some other Twitter users slammed Cruz for using some similar language about prayer and law enforcement in his tweets about some past shootings. That’s fair game. But the allegation in the viral tweet was that he has used the same three full sentences after 12 shootings and that’s just not true.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90di9iaWctYnJvdGhlci1hbGwtc3RhcnMtbWVtcGhpcy1nYXJyZXR0LWNocmlzdG1hcy1hYmJvdHQtbWFycmllZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Brother Stars Memphis Garrett Christmas Abbott Are Married,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='people.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /tv/big-brother-all-stars-memphis-garrett-christmas-abbott-married/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533DB92F20>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90di9iaWctYnJvdGhlci1hbGwtc3RhcnMtbWVtcGhpcy1nYXJyZXR0LWNocmlzdG1hcy1hYmJvdHQtbWFycmllZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzI5L2dvdi1hYmJvdHQtaGVja2xlZC1hdC1tZW1vcmlhbC1mb3ItdmljdGltcy1vZi10ZXhhcy1zY2hvb2wtc2hvb3Rpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov. Abbott heckled at memorial for victims of Texas school shooting,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was heckled by mourners Sunday during a visit to the Texas school where 19 children and two teachers were killed.

“Abbott is a son of a b—h” said Aracely Villalpando​ 59 of Fort Worth​.

“It’s awful — he’s not doing anything about gun laws and wants everyone to own a gun​” she said. “A lot of people like guns and that’s OK but how can you sell a military rifle to the public?​”​​

Salvador Ramos 18 entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde Texas on Tuesday carrying an AR-15-style assault rifle and killed 19 fourth-graders and two teachers.

Villalpando said US ​gun laws must be changed now — and that politicians cannot “play around for months and years.”

Abbott a Republican visited the school’s makeshift memorial outside as President Biden and first lady Jill Biden also paid their respects there.

The tragedy has been compounded by the fact that police waited 90 minutes after being called to the scene to enter the school — even though children were phoning 911 pleading for help as shots rang out.

“I am very angry with Pete Arredondo. If police acted faster there would not have been so many children taken” resident Rita Ortiz of Uvalde said outside the school Sunday.

Ortiz 53 whose children and grandchildren have all attended Robb Elementary said her 6-year-old granddaughter will not attend the school as planned next year because the family cannot trust district police to keep the students safe.

“If they couldn’t save those kids why would I rely on them to protect my granddaughter?” she said.​ ​“I don’t know what we’ll do with [granddaughter] Scarlett home-school maybe.”​

But the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation’s third annual Religious Equity Inclusion and Diversity Index shows that some of the nation’s biggest companies are getting it right when it comes to bringing together Americans of different faiths.

This year’s survey which was the largest to date assessed how Fortune 500 companies in the United States approach religious issues. American Airlines came out on top claiming the Religious Equity Inclusion and Diversity Index’s No. 1 spot for its efforts.

Other familiar names crowded the top 10 including Intel Dell Texas Instruments and Google. Among the additional corporations surveyed which included Global Fortune 500 companies and other businesses the information technology company Accenture took first place.

The companies that ranked the highest on the Religious Equity Inclusion and Diversity Index have some common approaches according to Brian Grim the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation’s founding president.

“They’re not just ticking a box and having a faith-based ERG (employee resource group) or covering religious discrimination in their training. They’re having a holistic approach to religious inclusion” said Grim who added that the most successful corporations aren’t “just inward focused but are also willing to share their experiences with other companies.”

Businesses that want to do better in this area should look to other companies to help. “What really is the change agent is the company to company transfer of knowledge” said Grim.

The spirit of openness — of sharing and learning — is a core component of cultivating an inclusive environment of any kind.

During Ramadan for example the digital infrastructure company Equinix which ranked sixth on this year’s index held several panels to help employees better understand the Muslim holiday. During a 2021 panel organized by Equinix — and attended by employees from Google Salesforce PayPal and Apple — Muslim employees shared childhood memories of Ramadan said Marsie Sweetland founder of Equinix’s FaithConnect initiative. The panel included a segment during which non-Muslim employees had the opportunity to ask questions like “‘What do we say? Happy Ramadan?’”

Participants also received practical suggestions about how to be culturally sensitive said Sweetland. “During Ramadan it might not be time to have a luncheon” she said. “If you do pack to-go boxes so Muslim employees can take them home” to eat after they break their fast.

Sweetland also moderated a Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur panel during which participants learned among other things not to wish Jews a “Happy Yom Kippur” as it is a solemn day of atonement.

To really succeed in fostering religious diversity equity and inclusion corporations need to go beyond increasing employees’ awareness of religious traditions. They need to take other concrete actions as well said Sumreen Ahmad Accenture’s global change management lead and the company’s North America interfaith lead.

“You really need to be bold in this space” said Ahmad. “It’s not just saying that this is important — it’s bold leadership taking actions that are needed (like) creating prayer space making sure there is a drop down (on menus) that allows me to select halal or kosher food.”

Taking such steps fosters “a community of belonging so (employees) can lead from their authentic self” she said.

Efforts to cultivate religious diversity equity and inclusion aren’t just about making employees feel good — there’s a bottom line benefit as well Grim said.

“Corporate culture matters” he said.

Not only does a more welcoming environment help companies recruit talent it’s also a key to retaining employees Grim added. Having a top-down exclusive grindstone culture saps employees’ motivation. Employees need to feel like their experiences and input are valued and like they’re part of shaping the company.

“If you feel like you don’t belong your ideas don’t belong your creativity doesn’t belong your beliefs don’t belong — if you are getting the message that you don’t belong then you’ll leave it and yourself at the door and find another door to go in” said Grim.

Addressing faith can influence product development which is also good for the bottom line Grim added pointing out that worldwide about 8 in 10 people are religious.

Religion is an up-and-coming topic when it comes to equity diversity and inclusion. Asked what other aspects of diversity companies should consider addressing Ahmad and Sweetland had some ideas.

Ahmad said her company is tackling socioeconomic diversity in a number of ways including attempts to recruit in geographically marginalized areas. “We’re going into these communities that are farther away from the big cities because there’s talent there” she said.

Not only would a socioeconomic employee resource group be productive Sweetland thought that Middle East and North Africa is an oft-overlooked diversity category as well. “MENA would also be a great ERG. We have seen a few and have heard of a few popping up” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVocmRpcmVjdG9yLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2RpdmVyc2l0eS1hbmQtZXF1YWxpdHktaW5jbHVzaW9uL2VtcGxveWVlcy1sb3dlci1zb2Npb2Vjb25vbWljLWJhY2tncm91bmRzLWRvbnQtZmVlbC1pbmNsdWRlZC13b3JrcGxhY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Employees from lower socioeconomic backgrounds don't feel Included in the workplace | theHRD,"Just two in five employees from lower socioeconomic backgrounds across U.K organisations feel included in the workplace and only half feel safe to be open about their background according to a new report from Accenture (NYSE: ACN).

The findings contradict high levels of optimism from employers on their progress with inclusion in the workplace. Nearly nine in 10 business leaders believe their employees from lower socioeconomic backgrounds feel included at work – double the actual proportion.

The new report titled A fair chance to advance: The power of culture to break socioeconomic barriers in the workplace surveyed 4000 employees and 1400 senior executives to explore how workplace culture affects the retention and progression of people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.

In addition to the divide between business leaders and employees on how included people feel in the workplace the report finds that employees from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are less likely to progress their careers at the same rate as their colleagues. One in five employees from low-income backgrounds are promoted once every three years compared to one in 4 of their colleagues. This means an estimated 700000 employees from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have missed out on promotion in the U.K.

“The findings will be sombre reading for British businesses looking to build a more socially diverse workforce” said Accenture’s UK & Ireland Market Unit Lead Simon Eaves. “It’s vital that employees feel seen and heard at work so they can thrive equally. By understanding the hidden and pervasive barriers that are holding people back businesses can access an untapped talent pool and tackle the skills shortages that continue to blight the economy.”

In the report Accenture also explored the relationship between workplace culture and social mobility. In organizations with more inclusive workplace cultures employees from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are both happier and more ambitious. In these companies over 90% of employees from lower socioeconomic backgrounds feel they have the same chance of success as their other colleagues compared to only 30% in companies with less inclusive cultures.

Furthermore the report finds that the profits of organizations focusing on improving social mobility are 1.4x higher than their competitors that are less focused on the issue.

Accenture found that these more inclusive organizations have adopted the following five key practices – which forms a “blueprint for socioeconomic inclusion”:

Trust and Responsibility : Individuals are trusted to take decisions and drive change

: Individuals are trusted to take decisions and drive change Role models: Employees see strong attainable role models

Employees see strong attainable role models Anti-discrimination policies : Employees are treated and compensated equally

: Employees are treated and compensated equally Flexibility : Employees are empowered to work when where and how they need

: Employees are empowered to work when where and how they need Openness & transparency: Employees feel safe to bring their true selves to work.

Camilla Drejer Accenture’s lead for Citizenship & Responsible Business in the UK & Ireland said “There is real value in a diverse workforce that reflects the makeup of society a business operates in. An inclusive business brings in different skills and mindsets and fosters a culture that boosts productivity. Of course creating a level playing field for people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds will not happen overnight. But with any business objective if organizations aim for it and manage it they are more likely to deliver it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmluL25ld3MvMzg1Mi9wcml5YS1yYW1kZXYtbGVhZHMtcGVvcGxlLWZ1bmN0aW9uLW9mLW1ja2luc2V5LWluLWluZGlh0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29uc3VsdGFuY3kuaW4vbmV3cy9hbXAvMzg1Mi9wcml5YS1yYW1kZXYtbGVhZHMtcGVvcGxlLWZ1bmN0aW9uLW9mLW1ja2luc2V5LWluLWluZGlh?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Priya Ramdev leads people function of McKinsey in India,"Global strategy consulting firm McKinsey & Company has welcomed Priya Ramdev as its new Chief People Officer for the Indian market.

He graduated at age 20 after studying computer science at University of Ife now Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife Osun State.Yusuf’s exposure with an IT firm in Ibadan sealed his fate and secured his future in technology. The knowledge garnered coupled with a solid academic background at Ife became a stepping stone. And what became indecipherable became clear and by the time the wave of information technology hit Nigeria like storm in the late 90s Yusuf became unstoppable in his field. After 24 years at Accenture he left in 2019 to start Verrakki Partners where he is currently the managing partner. Yusuf a multi-skilled business strategist tells

Funke Olaode his experience as a professional in information communication technology.

Olaniyi Mumini Yusuf a former Managing Director of Accenture and presently Managing Partners at Verraki Partners is a man who saw tomorrow. Yusuf as a young man became an integral party of innovation rooted in his study of computer science at a time when it wasn’t so popular. By the time Nigeria and Africa caught up with the global frenzy of information technology Yusuf was already there making waves. Initially he had gambled with the idea of studying Computer Science having set out to be an Agriculturist because of his father. But destiny played a fast one on him aided by his mentor whom he met as a teenager. That singular encounter redirected his career destiny.

Welcoming this reporter into his expansive office located on Bishop Aboyade Cole Victoria Island Lagos the former Accenture boss looked dapper in his blue Polo shirt. Yusuf is a man who is always at peace with himself.

“Well I think it is a mix of several things; a function of upbringing one’s level of spirituality and understanding that there is a Supreme Being. And as a Muslim there is a concept of destiny. Your destiny has been written and you need to strive but ultimately whatever is yours will not pass you. And whatever is not meant for you it does not matter how much you struggle you don’t get it. I think I am fortunate that I have that level of contentment. I struggle but it is never do or die for me. And internally I am at peace with myself maybe that is what you see or that translates to calmness. But people will tell you that I can be as tough and demanding as required. But I know that there is a design I may say that I am a person of destiny.”

Born on April 1 1970 to parents from Oyo State his late father hailed from Oyo while his mum is from Ibadan. He still had memories of his childhood in Ibadan and Oyo town. His mother was a nurse and would later retire as a matron.

“It was that bit about growing up with the mum who was in this clean starched white uniform and who commanded respect in the neighborhood. And then I had a father who was a supervisor at the Institute of Agric Research and Training Moore Plantation Ibadan. And he always came back home with food items and stuff like that. It was a middle-class upbringing. I went to a private primary school. I lost my dad at the age of five and since then it has been me and my mother with three younger siblings.”

Yusuf admitted that being raised by a single mother made him grow up fast and largely contributes to his calmness ‘because you just mature overnight.’ He also grew up understanding the values of hard work patience determination and place of faith in God and a lot of prayers.

After his primary education at Alafia Institute in Mokola Ibadan he had his secondary education at Oba Akinbiyi High School Mokola Ibadan after which he proceeded to Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife in Osun State where he studied Computer Science combined with Economics graduating at age 20 in 1990. He holds a Graduate Diploma in Business Administration from University of Wales Cardiff United Kingdom in 2015. He has equally attended many management and technical training programmes with many published articles in the areas of IT effectiveness. He is a fellow of Project Management Institute Fellow Nigeria Computer Society and Nigeria Institute of Management just to mention a few.

Yusuf is a multi-skilled business strategist management consultant technology advisor project management professional with over 20 years experience across multiple industries including financial services telecoms manufacturing mining oil and gas public sector health education NGO in Nigeria and West African countries.

Yusuf possesses strong leadership people development and business management skills with a proven record of accomplishment in high quality service delivery within multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural team environments.

His main assets to any assignment are his high level of commitment and the ability to work to the highest standards and rise to difficult challenges with client personnel to identify design and implement real improvement to the way an organisation works.

A multi-faceted individual he also has a keen interest in education employability and youth development. He is a volunteer to various organisations including Nigerian Economic Summit Group Junior Achievement of Nigeria Fate Foundation NASFAT Society Obafemi Awolowo University Muslim Alumni (UNIFEMGA) Corona Schools and Fountain University Osogbo.

In 2019 Yusuf and Partners floated Verraki Partners where he actively participated in the establishment of the practice and now responsible for managing the practice developing and championing ambitious growth plan and market positioning while ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

Yusuf’s case was an audacity of hope having lost his father at age five. There was a vacuum but he was fortunate to have a father figure in his maternal uncle Bolaji Oladipo whom he moved in with in 1983 while in form three. There Yusuf imbibed the habit of reading and that essentially changed his outlook on life.

Yusuf has been lucky all the way through his mentors whom he met while growing up and one can simply say he took his own destiny in his own hands since he cannot see the future. Recounting his sojourn in the ICT which has brought him fame and fortune he said with modesty “I am a lucky guy. I am a person of destiny. I went to a private primary school which of course gave me a solid foundation. I then went to a public secondary school. We were the first set of free education by Bola Ige in 1980. And in my class I was the youngest. At age 10 I was in form one. Coming from a private school was an added advantage because the things we were being taught in form one were things I had been taught in primary four and primary five. From form one to form five I was among the best students in the school. I finished secondary school at 15. And University of Ife was the only university that accepted people below the age of 16 back then. So Ife was the only school I could apply to.”

Again while applying for a course of study destiny also played a key role. For a novice embracing a course not so popular can create a chaos that inevitably comes with challenges of the unknown. Of course he did but being rooted in science courses helped and this became a propelling force. Then for a smart mind he tried to play safe by doing a combined honours mixing Computer Science with Economics.

“Computer Science wasn’t popular back then as a course of study. I would just say that it was not anything I planned for. Like I said from Form Three I moved in with my uncle and one of his very close friends Bola Ayodele worked with Join Komputer Kompany a technology company. Then they had an office in Bodija. And ‘Brother Bola’ was someone that I just loved and admired. The day I went to visit him he asked me “What are you filling for JAMB?” I said Agriculture. The man looked at me and said “Computer is the future.” Even though I didn’t understand what he was saying because he is someone that I liked admired and trusted I listened to him. Fortunately I had not submitted my JAMB form so I went back and changed it to computer science combined with Economics.”

Forward-looking Yusuf acted smartly by combining Computer Science with Economics because of fear of the unknown. He figured that if Computer Science would not work he would fall back on Economics and even aspired to be a Chartered Accountant.

“My solid background in sciences helped me to cope with Computer Science in year one. And by the time we were introduced to computers in year two it was interesting because we never even saw the computer but we just go and fill punch cards and you go and submit that. I then began to realise that this is the new thing and this will really change the world. By the time I got to year four we were working with personal computers and that was just transformative. That was when the graphical user interface was introduced in Windows 3.1. That just changed things so it changed from character systems to Window’s based plus graphical.

“Again I was lucky because I had brother Bola as a mentor and he introduced me to his friends at JKK. And so all my five years in Ife I was always doing internships. When Ife was shut down in 1986 I spent four months on strike with JKK. Every year there was a shut down I always had a place to go. I had exposure to computers and so it aided a great deal. Since I had that practical exposure I was able to combine it with the theoretical knowledge that was given at Ife. I think everything is just God’s design.”

By the time he left the university in 1990 Yusuf’s future in the ICT field had already been mapped out. Again he was working with a knowledgeable IT guru who was regularly teaching him about different techniques and encouraging him with the intrigues behind the system. The knowledge garnered at JKK coupled with a solid academic background gained at Ife helped. And what became indecipherable became clear. Yusuf became unstoppable in his field.

After his mandatory one year youth service at Ife he worked with Join Komputer Kompany (JKK) Nigeria Limited as Senior Software Engineer from 1991-1995. “It was a big deal for me working with one of the best IT companies then. At JKK we were processing payroll for Nigerian Police billing systems for NEPA and NITEL. These are all clients of JKK back then. My first project when I formally joined as a staff after NYSC was the automation of the banking application at the Central Bank of Nigeria. It was a three year project. I had great fun as a young graduate teaching senior managers and senior directors how to type. What we all took for granted today back then was strange because the banking application then was based on the Oracle platform. But I quickly understood that technology will drive automation automation will drive efficiency and efficiency will drive productivity and this will affect different sectors of the industry.”

With a high flying career running smoothly Yusuf was focused but yet ambitious because of the surrounding circumstances. Contented but ambitious he was going to make some hard choices. It wasn’t about career fulfillment but about breaking boundaries. He wanted to explore. The choice was hard but Yusuf couldn’t find a clause stating that when circumstances got difficult and hard choices and sacrifices were required someone could stop adhering to his instinct. He made the choice and quit JKK. He was 25. It was a decision that many may consider a misstep but it became a stepping stone to a greater height. A huge sacrifice that led to a career explosion. He joined one of the global brands Arthur Anderson.

“Like I said we deal with automated currency movement when all these bullion vans come from the various branches of commercial banks and they come to CBN to either drop or to take money we had automated producing a report on the system. So as the bullion vans come in you just make posting of which boxes of which currency notes were presented. But the head of currency office an elderly man who was used to the manual way of using ledgers resisted this new innovation. I said ‘ Sir I don’t need this ledger.’ And he said ‘Niyi stick with your computer and let me stick with my ledgers.’ That just got me thinking that change requires more than technology. Change requires changing the process training people sometimes changing the people and also a change of strategy and then technology. But technology is never enough it is technology plus people plus process plus strategy. And most Nigerian technology companies were only providing technology which is just one of the four things. Arthur Anderson then was the leading global management consulting firm and I joined them.”

Yusuf joined in 1995 and became the Managing Director in 2010. “When I joined Arthur Anderson I didn’t have anything beyond a five-year horizon you know spend five years and go back to pure tech. But then you are working in an environment where you are making a huge difference you are working with brilliant folks. I actually did not know that I had spent 24 years.”

What has been his driving force? “Just like brother Bolaji was instrumental to my growing up Dr. Suleiman who was the country manager for Arthur Anderson in 1995 has also been instrumental to my professional career. From Dotun I learnt the whole idea of nation building and community service. And Dotun’s view which I share wholeheartedly is that for whom God has been kind we all have a duty and obligation to help others and help our nation. And that if the nation does not improve there is a limit to how much we as individuals can be successful. In terms of community service Dotun introduced me to the Nigeria Economic Summit Group. Today I am the Vice Chairman of that board. Dotun introduced me to the Corona Schools Trust Council; today I chair the board of the secondary school and technology committee.”

After 24 years in Accenture Yusuf became his own boss. He teamed up with people of like minds and established Verraki Partners in 2019. The RAKI according to him is a Greek word used to describe the action of doing something with soul creativity pouring oneself into a task. With a mission statement to help enterprises and governments ignite opportunities unleash their potential and embrace change to achieve the seemingly impossible while the vision is to be the transformation partner of choice for enterprises and governments seeking to create a better future.

He is currently the President of NASFAT Society. How does he strike the right balance? “I think it boils down to your values. Part of my own value system is about service. Service to the nations service to the community which religion allows you to do. NASFAT today has an educational platform from primary to tertiary levels where talents are groomed. This is an opportunity to reach and impact millions of people. And so I am comfortable in my skin and I see the alignment between what I do as a person.”

Yusuf as a corporate man is also a family man. He got married in 1998 to his equally religious and down-to-earth wife whom he met during his undergraduate days at UNIFE. Her simplicity character and the nature of religiousness were the attractions. The marriage is blessed with three brilliant kids who are already focused like their remarkable father.

If there is any life lesson learnt that has directed his path Yusuf will quickly point at the value of hard work dedication commitment and good support system from friends and above all service to humanity.

“Believe me those that you have served will come back to serve you they will come back to help you. So nothing goes for nothing and I think the successes I have recorded are principally because I have served and in return people feel the need to help this guy or support this guy. I think those are the lessons learnt” he concluded."

Maintaining their Memorial Day tradition the Western Los Angeles County Council of the Boy Scouts of America paid tribute to fallen members of the armed services on Saturday May 28 at Los Angeles National Cemetery.

Every Year on the Saturday prior to Memorial Day the Boy Scouts Girl Scouts and members of the community get together to place 88000 Flags on the final resting place of thousands of servicemembers.

More than 5000 people were to attend the event.

What became Memorial Day was first observed on May 30 1868 as Decoration Day a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the Civil War dead with flowers.

It was established 25 days earlier by Maj. Gen. John Logan national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic an organization of veterans who fought for the Union in the Civil War. It is believed that date was chosen because flowers would be in bloom all over the nation.

By the end of the 19th century Decoration Day ceremonies were being held on May 30 throughout the nation. After World War I the holiday was changed to honor Americans who died fighting in all wars.

The term Memorial Day was first used in 1882 became more common after World War II and declared the official name by federal law in 1967.

Memorial Day had been observed on May 30 until being moved to the last Monday in May in 1971 under terms of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act which became law in 1968.

CNN —

It’s looking like this summer will be a travel season to remember especially following the Covid-stricken summers of 2020 and 2021.

“Not only are we seeing exponential travel enthusiasm we are also anticipating some amazing new summer experiences events and offerings” said Carole-Anne Hughs Wood director of marketing for Embark Beyond a New York-based luxury travel agency.

New York Disney World and the United Kingdom which is celebrating Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee all have great things going on.

“The excitement this summer to get out and experience the world both near and far from home certainly feels unprecedented” she added.

Andrew Steinberg a luxury travel agent affiliated with Ovation Travel Group said summer travel bookings are like “the floodgates have opened. People have been trapped inside for a long time they’ve been watching things online. Netflix subscription numbers are down now – people want experiences to touch and feel real life again.”

Here are some of the many experiences in destinations around the world that can offer the joy of travel again this summer:

Australia

While it’s winter Down Under the northern part of Australia has weather temperate enough for outdoor activities.

Destinations like Cairns the gateway to Queensland’s tropical north; the seaside village of Port Douglas; and Hamilton Island will be mild enough to swim and to experience the Great Barrier Reef and Daintree Rainforest. Another must-see here: The Whitsundays an archipelago of 74 tropical islands off the Queensland coast next to the reef.

Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park where the great red sandstone monolith formerly known as Ayers Rock is located is also a great spot this time of year.

I tried using Photoshop for iPad because 'a function to erase obstructive objects with one tap' and 'a function to cut out the subject with one shot' have been added.





Adobe's image editing tool Photoshop has an iPad version that is optimized for use on iPads and can be operated more intuitively instead of desktop PCs and iPhones. Adobe announced on May 11 2022 that the iPad version of Photoshop has released a function to execute ' fill according to content ' ' select subject' and ' remove background ' with one tap. It is possible to perform advanced image processing with AI even on the iPad so I actually tried using what kind of function it is.



Latest release of Adobe Photoshop iPad version: Rich in 'one tap' magic



The following movie is where I actually tried using the functions added to Photoshop for iPad.In Photoshop for iPad try erasing the penguins on the left of the photo below. Surround the penguins with the lasso tool and select ...





Tap the Fill Tool and select Fill with Content.







Then after a few seconds of processing the penguins disappeared cleanly.







When I deselect it I don't realize that there used to be a penguin unless I was told.







Also if you tap 'Select subject' from 'Selection tool' ...







The penguins in the center are automatically selected. It's not a perfect choice because of the background color but it's fairly accurate so a little tweaking is enough. It's a lot easier than selecting with the magnet selection tool or the automatic selection tool.







Also if you tap 'Delete background' from 'Selection tool' ...







It will remove the background at the same time you select the subject. In other words you can cut out with just one tap.







In addition 'automatic tone correction' 'automatic color correction' and 'automatic contrast' that can be used in Photoshop for desktop PC have been added to Photoshop for iPad. If you load the photo as shown below and select 'Automatic tone correction' from 'Filter and correction' ...







The tone of the photo is automatically corrected so that you can see the shade of the rock in the foreground.







In addition the iPad version of Photoshop also has 'direct access to more than 20000 Adobe Fonts from the text tool' 'loading your own custom fonts' 'renaming cloud documents while editing' and 'cloud documents at any time'. Functions such as 'Synchronize' and 'Check pins and annotations left by other users on the shared document on the comment panel' have also been added.

It goes without saying that this demo does not show the final product but rather a platform for potential solutions based on the Phison controller. Thus far we have only seen one company announce their upcoming products based on Gen5 interface. Apacer/Zadak claim that their next-gen NVMe 2.0 storage will offer up to 13000 MB/s read and 12000 MB/s write speed the company claims.

Experts say there is the potential for people living anywhere in the Americas to see an extremely rare meteor storm on Memorial Day after the sun goes down.

The meteors may be visible as Earth passes through the remains of a comet that split apart three decades ago and is still fragmenting CBS Denver reports. The comet — named ""Schwassmann-Wachmann 3"" — began to break up in 1995 and its debris is expected to intersect with the Earth's orbit which could result in an intense meteor shower called Tau Herculids.

A meteor shower is classified as a meteor storm when at least 1000 meteors per hour are produced.

""If it actually passes through this broken up trail you could see a lot of meteors every hour"" Fraser Cain publisher of the astronomy outlet ""Universe Today"" told KCBS Radio.

However Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society says the meteors entering the atmosphere must be larger than normal in order to be seen from the ground.

Because of that Lunsford says the meteor shower is highly unlikely — but he adds: ""We believe that this event has a chance of being something spectacular and that we would be remiss by not publicizing it.""

According to EarthSky.org the famous Leonid meteor storm of 1966 produced meteors falling at a rate of 40 meteors per second. Witnesses said they felt like they had to clutch the ground because of the impression of Earth moving through space.

NASA says astronomers have been observing the comet for nearly a century and the comet's trajectory and path around the sun is well understood.

""Amateur and professional astronomers around the world have been tracking its spectacular disintegration for years"" NASA said.

Russia’s Most Advanced Weapons Are Shockingly Packed With ‘American Components’ — Ukrainian Intelligence,"Ukraine has revealed the use of US-made microchips in the Russian military hardware thereby raising questions about Moscow’s ability to produce the technological components.

When the Ukrainian military started dismantling Russian weapons many pieces of captured or partially destroyed equipment had an abundant use of foreign microchips particularly those manufactured in the US.

According to the list of components shared by Ukrainian Intelligence with The War Zone Ua US defense portal the chips were found inside a recovered example of the 9S932-1 a radar-equipped air defense command post vehicle that is part of the larger Barnaul-T system a Pantsir air defense system a Ka-52 “Alligator” attack helicopter and a Kh-101 (AS-23A Kodiak) cruise missile.

List Of Components

Barnaul-T is Russia’s most high-end air defense command and control subsystem within the larger integrated system for air defense of the Russian Army Marine units and Airborne forces.

The 9S932-1 is a radar-equipped reconnaissance/control module of the Barnaul-T subsystem which conducts round-the-clock reconnaissance and exercises command and control of subordinate troops and their armaments in warfare on combat positions.

Russian Barnaul-T 9S932-1 command posts and Tor-M2 air defense systems with “Z” markets reportedly in Genichesk Kherson oblast Ukraine. https://t.co/fWIyklbvmg pic.twitter.com/b2v5qvDkdx — Rob Lee (@RALee85) February 24 2022

This module is directly linked to units equipped with various Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) Systems including Tor-M-series (SA-15) and 9K35 Strela (SA-13) surface-to-air missile systems 9K33 Osa (SA-8) wheeled surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems 2K22 Tunguska (SA-19) tracked air defense systems and 9K333 Verba (SA-25) MANPAD systems.

The Ukrainian Intelligence said they found eight micro-chips in the communications systems of the 9S932-1 module sourced from US manufacturers like Intel Micrel Micron Technology and Atmel Corp.

The Pantsir air defense system is a well-known medium-range SAM and an anti-aircraft artillery system. The Ukrainian specialists reportedly found five US-made chips – manufactured by AMD Rochester Electronics Texas Instruments and Linear Technology – inside the direction finder of this air defense system.

The Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM) have been in the news for their unexpectedly high rate of failure in long-range attacks against Ukrainian targets. In the words of a US Defense official during a briefing in March “either they’re failing to launch or they’re failing to hit the target or they’re failing to explode on contact”.

In addition to the reportedly high failure rates the Kh-101 also appears to be heavily dependent on foreign-made chips as the Ukrainian intelligence claimed to have found at least 35 US-made chips including those manufactured by Texas Instruments Atmel Corp.

The Ukrainian military claims that the guidance systems and electronics recovered from Russian Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles used in Ukraine were developed in the 1960-1970s. https://t.co/XF0lEM3jdH pic.twitter.com/4XTaWCO0WS — Rob Lee (@RALee85) April 22 2022

The high rate of failures and latest findings of such heavy dependence on foreign chips in Kh-101 ALCM should be concerning for Moscow as the missile’s Kh-102 variant is the Russian Air Force’s main air-launched nuclear-armed cruise missile.

Coming to the Ka-52 Alligator Russia’s twin-seat all-weather attack helicopter the Ukrainian specialists opened up its turreted electro-optical system in which they found 22 US-made chips and one Korean-made chip.

The US manufacturers included Texas Instruments IDT Altera USA Burr-Brown Analog Devices Inc. Micron Technology Linear Technology and TE Connectivity.

Chips Not Necessarily Sourced From Manufacturers

These chips may not have necessarily been sourced directly from the manufacturers as there is a massive and unregulated market for recycled chips emerging from China which could be a more likely source of these chips as many of them appear to be quite old according to Ukrainian specialists.

Also as reported earlier by EurAsian Times researchers in the UK revealed in April that Russia has been sourcing British-made dual-use components such as electronic chips and switchboards for its weaponry through intermediary businesses in India and China.

Earlier this month Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo who recently met Ukraine’s Prime Minister said during a Senate hearing “We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground it’s filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators.”

Components found in weapon systems are difficult to prevent from falling into the wrong hands but experts say that the US officials do have the authority to prevent shipments of such dual-use chips.

NATO Members Arming Russia?

The news comes after an astounding revelation in late April that how NATO members had used the ‘Grandfather Clause’ to bypass the EU embargo on Moscow.

According to an EU report at least ten NATO member states exported around €350 million ($378.6 million) in military hardware to Vladimir Putin’s regime out of which German and French companies accounted for 78 percent with €273 million ($295.4 million) worth of military export.

Despite an EU-wide embargo on arms supplies to Russia after the latter annexed Crimea in 2014 Germany and France delivered bombs rockets missiles and guns to Moscow.

In addition the French companies also delivered thermal imaging cameras as well as navigation systems for fighter aircraft attack helicopters and Russian tanks.

These member states took advantage of a loophole that allowed contracts signed before August 1 2014 or subsequent contracts that would help close those agreements to continue.

That said the latest findings have exposed the heavy dependence of Russian war machines on western technology in key sensitive areas such as targeting navigation communications and control systems of the weapons which could be deeply unsettling for Moscow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy92ZW50dXJlLWZpcm0tYXRvbWljby10YXBzLWV4LTA2MDAwMDEzMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Venture Firm Atomico Taps Ex-Revolut Executive Hoang as Partner,"(Bloomberg) -- Venture capital firm Atomico has tapped former Revolut Ltd. executive Don Hoang as its newest partner giving it a seasoned leader to back companies with a focus on the financial technology and mobility sectors.

Hoang joins London-based Atomico as the firm is raising $1.35 billion in new funds for financing startups Bloomberg News reported in March. Led by Skype co-founder Niklas Zennstrom Atomico was founded in 2006 and has backed startups including Klarna Bank AB and Stripe Inc.

Previously Revolut’s vice president of global business and before that an executive at Uber Technologies Inc. Hoang said in an interview that he will make investments at the Series A and growth stages and sees opportunity in the emerging field of decentralized finance.

Amid turbulence in private markets and plunging public technology stocks Hoang said he still saw opportunity in Europe’s booming venture sector as established US funds open up local branches. He said Atomico was suited to weather the current market since it backs startups at the earlier stages.

“There’s something special happening in the European venture community at the moment. You see all these funds coming to Europe you see a lot of opportunity” Hoang said. “We’re quite well diversified to handle volatility at any one stage of the cycle.”

The popularity of ""slow travel"" continues to increase as the tourism industry rebounds and adjusts COVID-19 protocols and restrictions. Travelers want to immerse themselves in their experiences and take their time going from place to place — and a great way to do so is traveling by train.

Amtrak's Crescent Route runs daily between New York City and New Orleans servicing 32 stations across the southeastern United States. While you can buy a ticket that will take you the entire length of the route (a 30-hour journey with plenty of amenities) travelers looking to get off and explore different destinations should purchase stop-specific tickets. Whether you're looking to go from Philadelphia to Atlanta or Charlotte North Carolina to Wilmington Delaware the Crescent Route brings you from Point A to Point B with ease.

Here are some of the key stops along Amtrak's Crescent route but you can view the full route here.

New York City - Moynihan Train Hall (NYP)

The journey begins (or ends depending on the direction of service) in the heart of Manhattan. Take at least a day to see as much of New York City as you can. Central Park the Metropolitan Museum of Art the High Line and the Empire State Building should all be on first-time visitors' lists. Expect all of that walking to work up an appetite: Grab an NYC bagel for breakfast and a slice of pizza for lunch or dinner.

Washington D.C. - Union Station (WAS)

As the train pulls into Union Station you'll begin to feel the thrum of the country's political epicenter. While you could spend weeks exploring Washington DC's cultural elements a few hours walking around the National Mall means you'll get to see the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Lincoln Memorial Korean War Veterans Memorial and many other significant sites. If you time it right the cherry blossoms may be in bloom.

ABNB,Airbnb,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOS9haXJibmItd29yay1mcm9tLWFueXdoZXJlLWJyaWFuLWNoZXNreS1pbnRlcnZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brian Chesky: ‘Work from anywhere’ policy has brought 1 million visits to Airbnb's job page,"When COVID-19 hit Airbnb’s business plunged 80% in two months. Today the rise of remote work and a resurgent travel market have pushed bookings and revenue above pre-pandemic levels. Through it all Chesky has leaned into big moves including the recent announcement of one of the industry’s most liberal “work from anywhere” policies. We caught up with the CEO at his latest Airbnb to talk about where the company goes from here.

This edited Q&A has been condensed for space and clarity.

Man on the move

You’re actually living in Airbnbs full-time right now. What has that experience been like?

Chesky: I started living on Airbnb in January. I’ve lived in about a dozen places: Atlanta Nashville Charleston Miami Boston Chicago a couple of places in Colorado Vancouver. Right now I’m in New York. [I stay at each] a little under a week. Moving can be difficult but I’ve just embraced it. I pack pretty light. It’s really just [golden retriever puppy] Sophie; she’s my primary accessory.

There are two things I’ve learned. One you can run a company the size of Airbnb from a laptop in a stranger’s house. That helped inspire our policy to allow employees to live and work anywhere in the world. If I can do it then why can’t other people do it? The other thing I noticed is that the longer you’re away the more you want to be in a home with amenities and the comfort of your office or your house. When you’re living and working on Airbnb it isn’t just a place to sleep.

I heard you recently stayed in some kind of princess cottage?

Yeah a fairy-tale princess cottage. There’s an impulsive side of me I just find Airbnbs and I book them.

I saw the words “princess cottage” and I thought it was cool. I should have spent more time reading! Because I got to the house and it was all pink inside. And there wasn’t a shower there was just a bathtub—a small bathtub for a small princess. But it captures the possibilities on Airbnb. Here’s this little cottage that this woman decked out with a theme. And it became a destination for people which I think is pretty special.

You mentioned the new “live and work anywhere” policy. It’s gotten attention not just because of the flexibility but also because you’ve said you’re not going to adjust salaries based on where workers live in contrast to some other big tech players.¹ Talk about that decision.

I’ll be super honest about this. I wasn’t expecting a big reaction; it got way more attention than I expected. Since we made the announcement more than 1 million people have visited our jobs page. I’ve had tons of other CEOs reach out to me saying “Hey we’re thinking about doing this.” I never predicted that our design would have an influence on the world. I think we just struck a chord.

I don’t think hybrid asking people to come back to work in the office three days a week actually provides a ton more flexibility than the old world. And I felt like location-based pay would eventually be an outdated practice. We’re just getting in front of the curve. And listen if people can live on Airbnb if I live in San Francisco and I want to go to Maine for three months am I going to lower your pay because Maine may have a lower cost of living? It would be kind of weird. If people live on Airbnb like I do are you going to give them a different paycheck every couple of weeks? So it started feeling like location-based pay presumes that people are completely rooted in one city and I felt like that was going to become a slightly anachronistic way to think about things.

By the way there was another reason: We’re all competing for the same talent. And so if Tech Company A lowers your pay and we don’t then you are going to come work for us. That’s where the rubber hits the road.

“We’re all competing for the same talent. If Tech Company A lowers your pay and we don’t then you are going to come work for us.” Brian Chesky

Keep it simple

Airbnb just reported strong Q1 results² but in the early days of the pandemic you looked to be in deep trouble.³ How did that crisis change the company?

By necessity we switched to being a functional organization. We had about 10 divisions before the pandemic. We were overextended. We couldn’t do everything—and we wouldn’t have the money to do it all. There were people who were predicting our demise articles asking if this was the end of Airbnb. So I looked at companies like Apple and what they did when people were predicting that they were going to go out of business—like Apple in the late ’90s. Steve [Jobs the late founder and CEO of Apple] basically took a divisional company and turned it into a functional organization. He took about 80 business SKUs and got it down to four. He made everything really simple. And we decided to simplify our business and go back to the basics back to our roots really out of necessity.⁴

But as we did it we realized it was actually easier to run a company this way. I wanted the whole company rowing in one direction. The best way to do that is to create an alignment mechanism; ours is a calendar. Most companies do this with metrics but a creative company doesn’t try to hit numbers. A creative company has a calendar it has deadlines.

So now we have two big releases each year one in May and one in November. It really helps allow people to be distributed because when people can roam around the world and live in any country they want as long as everything’s on a calendar everything’s coordinated.

You recently overhauled the ways you can search on Airbnb. What’s the rationale behind the shift?

From a business standpoint the most important thing we can do is not just add more hosts but also point demand where we have the most available hosts. There are Airbnbs in 100000 towns and cities and most people can only think of 20 to 30 places that they type into a search box. So we thought What if we organize homes by things people are passionate about like skiing or golfing or tree houses?

Before the pandemic people were not really interested in traveling in a completely different way. Business travel still dominated and people were just habituated. The pandemic started breaking people’s habits. Everyone had to reevaluate their lives including how to travel. We realized that once habits were changed people were going to be more flexible.

Give it away now

You signed the Giving Pledge in 2016.⁵ What’s your approach to philanthropy?

One of the things I want to do is help kids that are just like me. I was the son of two social workers basically middle-class. I didn’t dream of becoming a tech founder because I didn’t know any tech founders. I had never even heard of a tech founder. So I think I can help others realize their potential show them the great big world—maybe expose them through the power of education scholarships and travel.⁶ These are things that you could say are actively in my mind. But over the course of the next 50 years of my life or however long I live I’m sure there are going to be other issues that I grow passionate about.

Earlier this year Airbnb pledged to provide free temporary housing for up to 100000 Ukrainian refugees. How did you make that happen?

I think it was in October 2012 when Superstorm Sandy hit New York that the first [Airbnb host] opened their home to a person who had been displaced. Over the course of the last decade we’ve housed more than 100000 people in need of housing for free. A number of years ago we started housing refugees too. When the Afghanistan crisis broke out last year we had about 100000 people leaving Afghanistan come to the U.S. We decided to try to house a fifth of them. So we said We’re going to house 20000 people and we did.

[With Ukraine] we wanted to push ourselves … a big goal and an audacious number. So we announced 100000 and we mobilized. We’re a really nimble culture: We make a decision and the entire company turns very very quickly. You saw how fast we responded to the crisis in 2020; you saw how we were able to go public on Zoom during a pandemic. You saw how we have reinvented the product repeatedly. And you saw how we can respond to crises like Ukraine.

That war along with concerns over inflation and cratering tech stocks has many concerned about our overall economic direction. What do you see on the horizon for Airbnb?

We’re pretty resilient to whatever happens in the economy. In a good economy people have more money to travel. In a bad economy people want to save money when they travel and people want to make extra money in their homes. My evidence of this is how come we were the travel company that recovered fastest during the pandemic? Faster than hotels faster than airlines and faster than online travel companies. We are the most adaptable business model in all of travel by far. We have nearly every type of space at nearly every price point for nearly every type of person in nearly every geography in the world. We’re not just short term we’re also long term.⁷ So however the world changes we’ll be able to adapt.

Between the lines

(1) Comp conundrum: At Google which recently asked most of its employees to return to the office three days a week pay adjustments have become a major sticking point with workers. (See our story: “Inside Google’s push to nail hybrid work and bring its 165000-person workforce back to the office part-time.”)

(2) Booked and busy: Airbnb’s Q1 2022 revenue reported on May 3 came in at $1.5 billion—a 70% increase year over year. The company isn’t yet profitable but it’s getting close: Airbnb reported a net loss of $19 million in Q1 2022 compared to a $1.2 billion loss for the same period in 2021.

(3) Surviving the pandemic: When COVID-19 hit Airbnb was forced to delay a much-hyped IPO. Chesky also laid off about a quarter of his workforce and raised $2 billion in equity and debt financing to get through the crisis. The company eventually went public in December 2020.

(4) New and improved: Despite its push to simplify Airbnb has launched 150 new features and product upgrades in the past 12 months. The latest update includes “split stays” which lets users book two back-to-back stays and AirCover for guests—liability insurance which in the past was available only to hosts.

(5) Bye-bye billions: By signing Chesky who has a net worth estimated at $8.9 billion pledges to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes. His fellow cofounders Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk have made the same promise.

(6) Road scholar: Chesky is partnering with the Obamas on a new scholarship that includes a stipend and free Airbnb housing for students pursuing a summer work-travel experience.

(7) Permanent vacation: Long-term stays which Airbnb defines as bookings of 28 days or longer doubled from the first quarter of 2019 to this year. The category is the company’s fastest-growing.

It's the Palmer House in Ann Arbor Michigan designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. ""I'm a designer but growing up I always thought I wanted to be an architect"" Chesky tells CNBC Make It. ""If there's one listing I had to pick I'd say the Palmer House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright who is my favorite architect.""

The Palmer House which costs $750 per night includes three bedrooms and two baths enough room to comfortably fit six guests.

Set on a two-acre plot of secluded wooded land about one mile from the University of Michigan's main campus the Palmer House was commissioned in 1950 by William and Mary Palmer. A notable feature of the home is its design: Wright built the 2000-square-foot residence on a pattern of equilateral triangles and as a result none of the rooms have 90-degree corners.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5haXJibmIuY29tL2VuLXVrL3VuZGVyc3RhbmRpbmctbmV3LXBsYW5uaW5nLXBlcm1pc3Npb24tcnVsZXMtZm9yLXNlY29uZC1ob21lcy1pbi1lZGluYnVyZ2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Understanding new planning permission rules for second homes in Edinburgh,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5haXJibmIuY29tL2VuLXVrL3VuZGVyc3RhbmRpbmctbmV3LXBsYW5uaW5nLXBlcm1pc3Npb24tcnVsZXMtZm9yLXNlY29uZC1ob21lcy1pbi1lZGluYnVyZ2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533DCC3E80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5haXJibmIuY29tL2VuLXVrL3VuZGVyc3RhbmRpbmctbmV3LXBsYW5uaW5nLXBlcm1pc3Npb24tcnVsZXMtZm9yLXNlY29uZC1ob21lcy1pbi1lZGluYnVyZ2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tL2Jsb2cvc2hvcnQtdGVybS1yZW50YWwtY29tcGFuaWVzLXJ1c2gtdG8tZmlsbC1pbi1haXJibmJzLWNoaW5hLXZvaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Short Term Rental Companies Rush to Fill in Airbnb's China Void,"After Airbnb decided to exit the local Chinese market local players are rushing in: Tujia Meituan Muniao Fliggy and Xiaozhu are large local Chinese online travel and short-term rental players that are reaching out to the local Airbnb hosts to migrate them to their respective platforms according to this report.

Brat Fest 2020 was canceled because of the pandemic. The 2021 event was scaled back and run through different businesses.

This year though the festival has again taken over Alliant Energy Center’s Willow Island.

Volunteers log hours for specific nonprofits and those nonprofits get a portion of the sales. More than 100 charities will benefit from the 2022 event.

Dozens of volunteers staff the grills. Paul Podehl is in charge of all of them with a special title: Grill Sergeant.

“I think I got that [title] because when I burned too many brats they got me off the grills” Podehl laughed.

He seems to have a gift for burning brats. However there’s a lid for every pot.

“There are a few people that like their brats really well done” he said. “Years ago I had an older lady who would go to the cashier buy a bun and come back to my grill because she knew I’d burn one for her.”

It’s Podehl’s 21st year volunteering at Brat Fest. It’s his job to make sure the brat tent is always stocked with exactly what they need.

“I supervise the grills and direct where grillers go what product they’re grilling how fast they’re going how full to keep the grills” he said. “Just to keep up with production for the big tent where things are being sold.”

The volunteer opportunity is close to his heart.

“West Madison Special Olympics is the group that we volunteer for. We have a special needs daughter who’s in Special Olympics. She competes in six sports trains in eight” he said. “This is the major fundraiser for that group so we try to put in as many hours as we can.”

John Kraak has been volunteering on the grills for 17 years now. He missed seeing his friends the last two years.

“Meeting up with all the people again it’s been so much fun” Kraak said.

Of course volunteers are there to raise money for a nonprofit they care about. However they’ve created bonds that strengthen year after year.

“Ninety percent of us up here on the grills have been grilling for years so it’s like a family reunion” said Kraak.

Brat Fest continues Sunday and will be torn down Monday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93aXNjbmV3cy9uYW1lL2Vkd2FyZC1jdW1taW5ncy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDk2MDkwNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edward Cummings Obituary (1944 - 2022) - Baraboo WI - WiscNews.com,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/wiscnews/name/edward-cummings-obituary?id=34960906 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93aXNjbmV3cy9uYW1lL2Vkd2FyZC1jdW1taW5ncy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDk2MDkwNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The former aerospace employee is pressing the $1.4 trillion tech giant to address the hot-button issue of disinformation. Getting other shareholders to back Chevedden’s call still a fledgling topic for most investors may be a long shot. But for Main Street’s most prolific corporate agitator it’s part of a new front he’s battling companies on — their impact on society.

Chevedden more of a governance warrior than a social activist has spent almost three decades pressuring the biggest U.S. companies from General Motors Co. to eBay Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. on how they’re run.

Wealthier investors such as Carl Icahn — and more recently Elon Musk — spend billions of dollars buying stakes in businesses in order to instigate corporate change. Instead Chevedden owns just a tiny fraction of a corporation’s stock and then every year he churns out a hundred or so shareholder proposals pressuring boardrooms and C-suites on everything from the minutiae of voting bylaws to bigger issues such as executive bonuses. Shareholders then determine the fate of those official requests when they vote at annual meetings.

Chevedden is part of a cohort of small activist shareholders who’ve been taking aim at corporations since long before retail investors caused last year’s meme stocks frenzy. By owning $2000 worth of a company’s shares for at least three years they write 500-word proposals and get them placed on ballots to be voted on at annual shareholder elections. Thousands of those meetings are underway across the country the bulk of them beginning in April and running through mid-June.

Critics have mocked Chevedden and others like him anointing them with the impolite name of corporate gadflies. But there’s motivation in their derision: Corporations over the years have collectively spent millions of dollars on lawyers to fight Chevedden’s relentless stream of proposals from landing on their ballots sometimes even suing him.

“If I’m a nuisance I’m one with purpose’’ the laconic 76-year-old said listing stock tickers of companies from Netflix Inc. to Dallas-based Texas Instruments Inc. where his proposals have won.

Shifting tactics

Now after decades focusing on the unglamorous world of corporate governance — the “G” in environmental social and governance investing — Chevedden is trying to capitalize on the latest zeitgeist: the “S.” Historically the domain of larger investors including public pension funds and religious investors social proposals attracted unprecedented support during last year’s shareholder meetings as big money managers such as BlackRock Inc. threw their heft behind requests focused on climate change and racial disparities.

Tiny investor Engine No. 1 scored a stunning victory over Exxon Mobil Corp. last year by landing new directors on its board to help it shift toward clean energy while in recent months billionaire Icahn has been pressuring McDonald’s Corp. and Kroger Co. on animal welfare.

Since social issues are increasingly getting in the eyes of investors Chevedden said of his new mantle “it’s best to go where the votes are.”

The first shareholder proposal Chevedden ever filed was personal. In 1994 after being laid off from his job as an administrator at Hughes Aircraft Co. he submitted a proposal to Hughes’ owner General Motors on its employment practices related to layoffs. He studied books on shareholder activism and spoke to corporate governance experts.

Chevedden’s GM proposal lost. But he was hooked by the combined thrill of fighting for the little-guy investor and holding powerful executives to account. Over the following decades he turned this new hobby into an unpaid profession submitting more than a thousand shareholder proposals while living off his savings and stock market investments.

“I don’t live a lavish lifestyle’’ said Chevedden who owns about 200 stocks collectively worth more than $1 million and drives a Honda Accord.

Shareholder activism was pioneered by New York brothers Lewis and John Gilbert who in the 1930s started pressing corporate executives on governance issues. Their work inspired other small investors including the late Evelyn Davis who for more than 50 years pressured companies and berated chief executives often appearing in costume at annual meetings.

Small shareholder activists have succeeded in getting companies to enact rules ranging from requiring directors to retain company stock for a certain period to having an independent board chair. Occasionally they pair up to file proposals and attend company meetings on each other’s behalf. (Chevedden sometimes partners with a group of three other shareholder activists who by comparison file only a few dozen proposals each year.) Despite their size they’ve had outsize influence on corporate America accounting for about a third of the 2500 or so proposals that landed on ballots since the start of 2017 according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

Companies fight to keep proposals off ballots by either trying to persuade filers to withdraw them or asking regulators to quash them. Failing that executives will urge shareholders to vote against the proposals. While corporations aren’t legally required to follow through on winning proposals many still do and do take note when resolutions get more than a quarter of the votes.

Tackling disinformation

Chevedden’s proposals have gotten an average of 39% shareholder backing over the past five years data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows. While many of his proposals don’t win those that do — sometimes with overwhelming investor support — have catalyzed change in the boardroom. His winning requests include getting all Netflix board directors to subject themselves to annual reelection; requiring FedEx Corp.’s board to get approval from shareholders on some severance or termination payments in executive pay packages; and at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. removing a requirement for a two-third majority vote for shareholder proposals according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

The downside of so many governance-oriented proposals getting adopted by companies is that “finding new issues that garner consensus among large shareholders may become more difficult’’ said Yaron Nili a law professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who wrote a paper on small activist investors. Which is why as investors flock to ESG — even as it comes under mounting criticism from insiders and Republicans alike — Chevedden has discovered a whole new battleground.

Chevedden’s initial way in was politics. Four years ago he started calling on companies including Fedex and Ford Motor Co. to disclose details of their political contributions and lobbying. “We don’t want companies supporting political candidates or pet projects of the CEO’’ he said. Since then more than a third of the 16 proposals Chevedden has filed on lobbying and political spending have won. This year he has five requests on the ballot.

Next in his path is disinformation. Not only has it fueled hate speech and violence during the pandemic it also has created gridlock in government preventing laws and regulations from being passed Chevedden said. “Misinformation results in general chaos’’ he said.

Google parent Alphabet is now in his crosshairs. His proposal is asking the tech giant to report the risks of disinformation — which he says it profits from — and how those risks affect society and the economy at large. A report “will help shareholders understand where the company’s prioritization of profits before people creates a financial risk to their portfolios’’ Chevedden said in the proposal which he wrote in partnership with a nonprofit called Shareholder Commons. (Another shareholder is asking Alphabet to commission an independent report on how it manages misinformation on its platforms. Meta Platforms Inc. formerly Facebook Inc. is facing a similar proposal from another investor.)

In response Alphabet asked regulators unsuccessfully to thwart Chevedden’s proposal from reaching the ballot and is now recommending that shareholders vote against it at Wednesday’s meeting. The company also has said that addressing misinformation is a top priority and that it’s doing everything from employing intelligence and security experts to blocking millions of pages and videos that violate policies. “We remain committed to fighting disinformation” Alphabet said in its proxy statement.

The company has been unscathed by Chevedden’s previous governance-related proposals over the years. (Two misinformation-related proposals filed by other investors with Alphabet in 2018 and 2019 failed to get more than 13% of votes according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.)

Two prominent firms that give recommendations to shareholders — Glass Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services — are suggesting investors vote against Chevedden’s proposal at Alphabet. “Although we have a number of concerns regarding the company’s practices and disclosures we aren’t of the view that adoption of this proposal would necessarily ameliorate these concerns’’ Glass Lewis said in a report.

Chevedden’s proposal will be one of 21 that will be voted on at Alphabet’s annual meeting. A spokeswoman for the company based in Mountain View Calif. referred to its proxy statement.

Activists like Chevedden view each proposal less as a now-or-never moment but the beginning of a longer awareness campaign to bring issues into the mainstream with other investors. So even if his Alphabet proposal doesn’t pass — the probable outcome — he is hardly deterred.

“It’s a feeling of being competent’’ Chevedden said of his life’s work noting that he relishes getting his proposals on ballots after corporations and their lawyers fight so hard to quash them. “Where else can someone that’s never gone to law school beat a $2 billion law firm?’’

Raju Prasad began accepting donations via mobile-payment apps a few months ago. The 42-year-old said his takings have almost doubled to about 300 rupees a day—that is roughly $4 and more than the average daily wage for a farm laborer in Bihar India’s poorest state. Many travelers now zap over 5 or 10 rupees with a few taps on their smartphones instead of digging out their wallets.

“People used to shoo me away saying they didn’t have cash"" said Mr. Prasad who makes much of his money from passengers arriving at Bettiah station from big cities like New Delhi and Mumbai. “Now they scan my QR codes and happily give whatever small amount they want.""

The fact beggars and their donors are all part of India’s digital finance revolution helps explain the explosive growth in mobile payments—along with the challenge companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google LLC Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart and local rival Paytm face in making the business profitable.

Indians have been migrating toward digital financial services for some time. That is in part due to rising wealth better internet and more-affordable technology—and because Prime Minister Narendra Modi put digital transformation at the center of government policy.

Launched in 2015 “Digital India"" aims for faster and more inclusive economic growth by pushing government and banking services online and by bringing the country’s masses of poor especially in rural areas into the formal economy through investment in technology.

But it was the pandemic that turbocharged the shift. Lockdowns forced millions of people to buy groceries and medicine through mobile apps because they couldn’t leave their homes. ATMs ran out of cash—which in any case many people shunned over fears they would catch the virus by handling physical money.

By the second quarter of 2020 mobile payments had eclipsed ATM withdrawals to account for 30% of Indian private consumption according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Mobile payments more than doubled to almost $1 trillion in 2021 from the year before.

“The only silver lining of the pandemic is that everyone started using digital payments a lot more"" said Karthik Raghupathy head of strategy and investor relations for PhonePe Flipkart’s payment unit. As Covid-19 reached India PhonePe’s registered users jumped 50% he said.

Bangalore-based PhonePe now has around 165 million monthly active users and 48% of India’s mobile payments by value says S&P Global. Google’s share is 40% and Paytm’s is almost 9%.

India’s 48.6 billion digital payments last year were more than double those in next-ranked China according to an April report by payment-systems company ACI Worldwide which said volumes could top 200 billion by 2026. But with the average Indian user making $80 of payments a year compared with $2300 in China and almost $8000 in the U.S. as well as a government cap on transaction fees India’s allure is more the potential to secure a slice of its market of nearly 1.4 billion people than near-term profit.

For now digital-payment providers in India are likely losing money—and lots of it analysts say.

That is partly due to the way India’s payments system evolved.

Countries like China and the U.S.—the two biggest digital-payments markets by value—relied on private companies to develop the technological backbone to support phone transactions. In India that task was given to the National Payments Corporation of India a nonprofit organization that governs the country’s retail payments. It had a mandate to “facilitate an affordable payment mechanism to benefit the common man across the country and promote financial inclusion.""

The Indian government views digital-payment systems as a public good similar to the power grid said Dilip Asbe NPCI’s managing director and chief executive.

“The efficiency in the payment system is core to the economy"" he said as it improves transparency tax collection and the circulation of money in the formal economy.

NPCI launched its Unified Payments Interface in 2016. Companies were then invited to develop apps on top of the platform better known as UPI.

India also had three ingredients UPI needed to succeed Mr. Asbe said: ID cards bank accounts and smartphones. Mr. Modi’s government has pushed people to get biometric ID cards and for every household to have at least one bank account.

About 80% of adults had bank accounts by 2017 from 35% six years earlier the most recently published central-bank data show. The number of smartphone users meanwhile has risen to 750 million Deloitte said in a February report.

UPI’s platform is also interoperable. Transactions are made by scanning a QR code linked to a person or business or by looking up someone’s phone number or virtual address. All the QR codes work on any of the apps hosted by UPI. That is a contrast to the U.S. where someone shopping at Walmart for example can’t scan the checkout QR code using PayPal’s Venmo app.

Fueled by the pandemic UPI’s users soared 85% to 250 million in the two years to March with more than 300 banks and two dozen payment apps now on the platform.

The interoperability that helped power adoption of mobile payments however also makes it easy to switch between apps forcing companies to give cash rebates and other incentives to keep customers. They have also spent heavily on marketing and educating merchants and consumers on how mobile payments work.

“It’s a chicken and egg problem"" said Madhur Deora Paytm’s chief financial officer: If not enough merchants sign up customers will have little reason to do so.

Almost 90% of India’s nearly $900-billion-a-year retail market is controlled by small family-owned shops that rarely accept credit cards because of the 3% to 4% charges they levy. A 2020 government ban on transaction fees for UPI-based payments enticed many smaller merchants to sign up—along with their customers.

The ban is also one of the biggest hurdles to profitability for the payments companies. In January a group of them urged the government to scrap the rule which they estimated had caused an industrywide loss of more than $700 million.

Analysts said it would take at least a few years before any mobile-payment company turns a profit in India. Meanwhile local startups are competing against giants like Google and Walmart that can afford to burn through cash as they build market share.

In the long run digital-payment companies are looking to sell financial services and other products said Sampath Sharma Nariyanuri an S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst.

PhonePe is advertising insurance products on television. Google Pay recently let merchants open digital storefronts within its app. Paytm meanwhile plans to seek regulatory approval to sell insurance.

In Bakharia village in Bihar state with a population of about 1500 almost all the two dozen or so stores and stalls straddling the main road display placards or stickers with QR codes.

Ranjan Patel who operates a small shop selling betel nuts said he signed up for multiple apps after customers began demanding to pay with their smartphones. Now almost 80% of them do.

“They like to flaunt their smartphones and scan QR codes to pay"" he said."

The former aerospace employee is pressing the $1.4 trillion tech giant to address the hot-button issue of disinformation. Getting other shareholders to back Chevedden’s call still a fledgling topic for most investors may be a long shot. But for Main Street’s most prolific corporate agitator it’s part of a new front he’s battling companies on — their impact on society.

Chevedden more of a governance warrior than a social activist has spent almost three decades pressuring the biggest U.S. companies from General Motors Co. to eBay Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. on how they’re run.

Wealthier investors such as Carl Icahn — and more recently Elon Musk — spend billions of dollars buying stakes in businesses in order to instigate corporate change. Instead Chevedden owns just a tiny fraction of a corporation’s stock and then every year he churns out a hundred or so shareholder proposals pressuring boardrooms and C-suites on everything from the minutiae of voting bylaws to bigger issues such as executive bonuses. Shareholders then determine the fate of those official requests when they vote at annual meetings.

Chevedden is part of a cohort of small activist shareholders who’ve been taking aim at corporations since long before retail investors caused last year’s meme stocks frenzy. By owning $2000 worth of a company’s shares for at least three years they write 500-word proposals and get them placed on ballots to be voted on at annual shareholder elections. Thousands of those meetings are underway across the country the bulk of them beginning in April and running through mid-June.

Critics have mocked Chevedden and others like him anointing them with the impolite name of corporate gadflies. But there’s motivation in their derision: Corporations over the years have collectively spent millions of dollars on lawyers to fight Chevedden’s relentless stream of proposals from landing on their ballots sometimes even suing him.

“If I’m a nuisance I’m one with purpose’’ the laconic 76-year-old said listing stock tickers of companies from Netflix Inc. to Dallas-based Texas Instruments Inc. where his proposals have won.

Shifting tactics

Now after decades focusing on the unglamorous world of corporate governance — the “G” in environmental social and governance investing — Chevedden is trying to capitalize on the latest zeitgeist: the “S.” Historically the domain of larger investors including public pension funds and religious investors social proposals attracted unprecedented support during last year’s shareholder meetings as big money managers such as BlackRock Inc. threw their heft behind requests focused on climate change and racial disparities.

Tiny investor Engine No. 1 scored a stunning victory over Exxon Mobil Corp. last year by landing new directors on its board to help it shift toward clean energy while in recent months billionaire Icahn has been pressuring McDonald’s Corp. and Kroger Co. on animal welfare.

Since social issues are increasingly getting in the eyes of investors Chevedden said of his new mantle “it’s best to go where the votes are.”

The first shareholder proposal Chevedden ever filed was personal. In 1994 after being laid off from his job as an administrator at Hughes Aircraft Co. he submitted a proposal to Hughes’ owner General Motors on its employment practices related to layoffs. He studied books on shareholder activism and spoke to corporate governance experts.

Chevedden’s GM proposal lost. But he was hooked by the combined thrill of fighting for the little-guy investor and holding powerful executives to account. Over the following decades he turned this new hobby into an unpaid profession submitting more than a thousand shareholder proposals while living off his savings and stock market investments.

“I don’t live a lavish lifestyle’’ said Chevedden who owns about 200 stocks collectively worth more than $1 million and drives a Honda Accord.

Shareholder activism was pioneered by New York brothers Lewis and John Gilbert who in the 1930s started pressing corporate executives on governance issues. Their work inspired other small investors including the late Evelyn Davis who for more than 50 years pressured companies and berated chief executives often appearing in costume at annual meetings.

Small shareholder activists have succeeded in getting companies to enact rules ranging from requiring directors to retain company stock for a certain period to having an independent board chair. Occasionally they pair up to file proposals and attend company meetings on each other’s behalf. (Chevedden sometimes partners with a group of three other shareholder activists who by comparison file only a few dozen proposals each year.) Despite their size they’ve had outsize influence on corporate America accounting for about a third of the 2500 or so proposals that landed on ballots since the start of 2017 according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

Companies fight to keep proposals off ballots by either trying to persuade filers to withdraw them or asking regulators to quash them. Failing that executives will urge shareholders to vote against the proposals. While corporations aren’t legally required to follow through on winning proposals many still do and do take note when resolutions get more than a quarter of the votes.

Tackling disinformation

Chevedden’s proposals have gotten an average of 39% shareholder backing over the past five years data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows. While many of his proposals don’t win those that do — sometimes with overwhelming investor support — have catalyzed change in the boardroom. His winning requests include getting all Netflix board directors to subject themselves to annual reelection; requiring FedEx Corp.’s board to get approval from shareholders on some severance or termination payments in executive pay packages; and at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. removing a requirement for a two-third majority vote for shareholder proposals according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

The downside of so many governance-oriented proposals getting adopted by companies is that “finding new issues that garner consensus among large shareholders may become more difficult’’ said Yaron Nili a law professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who wrote a paper on small activist investors. Which is why as investors flock to ESG — even as it comes under mounting criticism from insiders and Republicans alike — Chevedden has discovered a whole new battleground.

Chevedden’s initial way in was politics. Four years ago he started calling on companies including Fedex and Ford Motor Co. to disclose details of their political contributions and lobbying. “We don’t want companies supporting political candidates or pet projects of the CEO’’ he said.

The popularity of ""slow travel"" continues to increase as the tourism industry rebounds and adjusts COVID-19 protocols and restrictions. Travelers want to immerse themselves in their experiences and take their time going from place to place — and a great way to do so is traveling by train.

Amtrak's Crescent Route runs daily between New York City and New Orleans servicing 32 stations across the southeastern United States. While you can buy a ticket that will take you the entire length of the route (a 30-hour journey with plenty of amenities) travelers looking to get off and explore different destinations should purchase stop-specific tickets. Whether you're looking to go from Philadelphia to Atlanta or Charlotte North Carolina to Wilmington Delaware the Crescent Route brings you from Point A to Point B with ease.

Here are some of the key stops along Amtrak's Crescent route but you can view the full route here.

New York City - Moynihan Train Hall (NYP)

The journey begins (or ends depending on the direction of service) in the heart of Manhattan. Take at least a day to see as much of New York City as you can. Central Park the Metropolitan Museum of Art the High Line and the Empire State Building should all be on first-time visitors' lists. Expect all of that walking to work up an appetite: Grab an NYC bagel for breakfast and a slice of pizza for lunch or dinner.

Washington D.C. - Union Station (WAS)

As the train pulls into Union Station you'll begin to feel the thrum of the country's political epicenter. While you could spend weeks exploring Washington DC's cultural elements a few hours walking around the National Mall means you'll get to see the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Lincoln Memorial Korean War Veterans Memorial and many other significant sites. If you time it right the cherry blossoms may be in bloom.

Charlottesville VA - Charlottesville Union Station (CVS)

“People used to shoo me away saying they didn’t have cash"" said Mr. Prasad who makes much of his money from passengers arriving at Bettiah station from big cities like New Delhi and Mumbai. “Now they scan my QR codes and happily give whatever small amount they want.""

The fact beggars and their donors are all part of India’s digital finance revolution helps explain the explosive growth in mobile payments—along with the challenge companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google LLC Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart and local rival Paytm face in making the business profitable.

Indians have been migrating toward digital financial services for some time. That is in part due to rising wealth better internet and more-affordable technology—and because Prime Minister Narendra Modi put digital transformation at the center of government policy.

Launched in 2015 “Digital India"" aims for faster and more inclusive economic growth by pushing government and banking services online and by bringing the country’s masses of poor especially in rural areas into the formal economy through investment in technology.

But it was the pandemic that turbocharged the shift. Lockdowns forced millions of people to buy groceries and medicine through mobile apps because they couldn’t leave their homes. ATMs ran out of cash—which in any case many people shunned over fears they would catch the virus by handling physical money.

By the second quarter of 2020 mobile payments had eclipsed ATM withdrawals to account for 30% of Indian private consumption according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Mobile payments more than doubled to almost $1 trillion in 2021 from the year before.

“The only silver lining of the pandemic is that everyone started using digital payments a lot more"" said Karthik Raghupathy head of strategy and investor relations for PhonePe Flipkart’s payment unit. As Covid-19 reached India PhonePe’s registered users jumped 50% he said.

Bangalore-based PhonePe now has around 165 million monthly active users and 48% of India’s mobile payments by value says S&P Global. Google’s share is 40% and Paytm’s is almost 9%.

India’s 48.6 billion digital payments last year were more than double those in next-ranked China according to an April report by payment-systems company ACI Worldwide which said volumes could top 200 billion by 2026. But with the average Indian user making $80 of payments a year compared with $2300 in China and almost $8000 in the U.S. as well as a government cap on transaction fees India’s allure is more the potential to secure a slice of its market of nearly 1.4 billion people than near-term profit.

For now digital-payment providers in India are likely losing money—and lots of it analysts say.

That is partly due to the way India’s payments system evolved.

Countries like China and the U.S.—the two biggest digital-payments markets by value—relied on private companies to develop the technological backbone to support phone transactions. In India that task was given to the National Payments Corporation of India a nonprofit organization that governs the country’s retail payments. It had a mandate to “facilitate an affordable payment mechanism to benefit the common man across the country and promote financial inclusion.""

The Indian government views digital-payment systems as a public good similar to the power grid said Dilip Asbe NPCI’s managing director and chief executive.

“The efficiency in the payment system is core to the economy"" he said as it improves transparency tax collection and the circulation of money in the formal economy.

NPCI launched its Unified Payments Interface in 2016. Companies were then invited to develop apps on top of the platform better known as UPI.

India also had three ingredients UPI needed to succeed Mr. Asbe said: ID cards bank accounts and smartphones. Mr. Modi’s government has pushed people to get biometric ID cards and for every household to have at least one bank account.

About 80% of adults had bank accounts by 2017 from 35% six years earlier the most recently published central-bank data show. The number of smartphone users meanwhile has risen to 750 million Deloitte said in a February report.

UPI’s platform is also interoperable. Transactions are made by scanning a QR code linked to a person or business or by looking up someone’s phone number or virtual address. All the QR codes work on any of the apps hosted by UPI. That is a contrast to the U.S. where someone shopping at Walmart for example can’t scan the checkout QR code using PayPal’s Venmo app.

Fueled by the pandemic UPI’s users soared 85% to 250 million in the two years to March with more than 300 banks and two dozen payment apps now on the platform.

The interoperability that helped power adoption of mobile payments however also makes it easy to switch between apps forcing companies to give cash rebates and other incentives to keep customers. They have also spent heavily on marketing and educating merchants and consumers on how mobile payments work.

“It’s a chicken and egg problem"" said Madhur Deora Paytm’s chief financial officer: If not enough merchants sign up customers will have little reason to do so.

Almost 90% of India’s nearly $900-billion-a-year retail market is controlled by small family-owned shops that rarely accept credit cards because of the 3% to 4% charges they levy. A 2020 government ban on transaction fees for UPI-based payments enticed many smaller merchants to sign up—along with their customers.

The ban is also one of the biggest hurdles to profitability for the payments companies. In January a group of them urged the government to scrap the rule which they estimated had caused an industrywide loss of more than $700 million.

Analysts said it would take at least a few years before any mobile-payment company turns a profit in India. Meanwhile local startups are competing against giants like Google and Walmart that can afford to burn through cash as they build market share.

In the long run digital-payment companies are looking to sell financial services and other products said Sampath Sharma Nariyanuri an S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst.

PhonePe is advertising insurance products on television. Google Pay recently let merchants open digital storefronts within its app. Paytm meanwhile plans to seek regulatory approval to sell insurance.

In Bakharia village in Bihar state with a population of about 1500 almost all the two dozen or so stores and stalls straddling the main road display placards or stickers with QR codes.

Ranjan Patel who operates a small shop selling betel nuts said he signed up for multiple apps after customers began demanding to pay with their smartphones. Now almost 80% of them do.

“They like to flaunt their smartphones and scan QR codes to pay"" he said."

This post supports remediating vulnerabilities only on Linux operating systems supported by the Systems Manager agent.

AWS recently launched the new Amazon Inspector for performing continuous vulnerability scans on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and container images stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). These scans assess software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. The new Amazon Inspector uses the Systems Manager (SSM) agent to collect software application inventory of the Amazon EC2 instances. Then Inspector scans this data and identifies software vulnerabilities a crucial step in vulnerability management.

You should perform regular patching operations for resolving vulnerabilities identified by Amazon Inspector based on the severity of the vulnerabilities. You can use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate the process of patching nodes managed by Systems Manager using the SSM agent. There may be zero-day or other high and critical severity vulnerabilities where patches are available. However you may not want to wait for the regular patching schedule to remediate them. In these cases on-demand mechanisms for patching should exist.

This series provides two methods for remediating Amazon Inspector software vulnerability findings on-demand using a Systems Manager Automation runbook. An Automation runbook defines the AWS Systems Manager’s actions on your managed instances and other AWS resources when an automation runs. It contains one or more steps that run in sequential order or branches based on preceding steps. You can prepare both methods in your AWS account to be ready for use when speed is critical to remediate software package vulnerabilities identified by Inspector.

In Part 1 of this series you’ll learn how to remediate Inspector findings for a specific vulnerability affecting multiple EC2 instances. You will use AWS Security Hub custom actions to trigger a Systems Manager Automation runbook for on-demand vulnerability patching on the selected EC2 instances.

In Part 2 you’ll learn how to directly invoke the Systems Manager Automation runbook to remediate all Amazon Inspector findings for EC2 instances using resource tags and Amazon Inspector finding severity. You’ll use the Systems Manager Automation runbook direct invocation method if you want to attempt patching all software vulnerabilities identified by Inspector. This approach effectively manages the EC2 instance fleet using tag-based targeting across your AWS Organization.

These methods work in multiple regions and accounts managed by an AWS Organization. They can help you reduce the operational complexity of manual updates reduce errors and increase the remediation speed.

Solution overview

Remediate using Security Hub custom action

This method lets you remediate selected Amazon Inspector findings from Security Hub using custom actions. The custom action enables an Automation runbook for selected findings. Then the Automation runbook will use the affected packages’ information from the Amazon Inspector findings details and use Systems Manager Patch manager to update only these packages to the latest version. Enable Security Hub to use this method.

For example there are affected packages in the following figure curl and libcurl  for CVE 2017-8816. When the user invokes the custom action for this finding Systems Manager Patch Manager updates both packages on the target managed instance. Amazon Inspector will automatically close all of the findings associated with these affected packages shortly after the vulnerability is patched.

Figure 1: Finding details in the Amazon Inspector Console.

The Security Hub delegated administrator account can trigger the automation runbook and target Amazon EC2 instances in member accounts in a multi-account multi-region scenario. This post provides two custom actions that update the affected packages and either perform a reboot or defer the instance reboot. You can choose to reboot the Amazon EC2 instance after installing updates to benefit immediately from the updates. Furthermore you can delay the reboot to your maintenance window by selecting the no reboot option.

With this custom action we recommend searching Amazon Inspector findings with a specific CVE. You can use the Title filter in Security Hub filter match type as starts with and enter the CVE as shown using arrows in the following figure. Use the Resource Type filter with AwsEc2Instance to only show findings associated with Amazon EC2 instances. Once these filters are selected Security Hub will show you all Amazon EC2 instances affected by the CVE. Then you can choose all the findings displayed with this filter associated with Amazon EC2 instances and run the custom action.

The following figure illustrates that you can run the custom action on multiple findings associated with different Amazon EC2 instances. However you shouldn’t select numerous Amazon Inspector findings for the same Amazon EC2 instance. To resolve multiple Amazon Inspector findings for the same Amazon EC2 instances see Part 2 of this series.

Figure 2: Selecting multiple Amazon Inspector findings for remediation in Security Hub.

Architecture overview

The automation workflow enables the resolveInspectorFindingsRunbook custom Automation runbook provided in this post. Security Hub Custom action initiates this runbook as described in the solution overview section. Let’s review the process as shown in the following figure:

Figure 3: Automation process in multiple accounts

When using the Security Hub custom action you select the Amazon Inspector finding in Security Hub and invoke the custom action. An event is sent to Amazon EventBridge with the Amazon Inspector finding details. The resolveInspectorFindings EventBridge rule matches this event pattern. The resolveInspectorFindings EventBridge rule parses the Amazon EC2 instance ID and Amazon Inspector finding ID to the Automation runbook as parameters. The reboot option is selected based on the custom action being used. The resolveInspectorFindingsRunbook creates a multi-account and multi-Region StartAutomationExecution API call to initiate the patch workflow in the target account and Region of the Amazon EC2 instance. A Python script gathers the affected packages for the Amazon Inspector finding as shown in Figure 1. Then the script creates a patch install override list from the affected packages gathered. The delegated administrator account stores the list in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. The AWS CloudFormation template provided with this post creates this bucket . A Run Command task for the document AWS-RunPatchBaseline is run on the Amazon EC2 instance using the install override list created in Step 4. The reboot option is passed based on the Security Hub custom action selected. If an existing patching operation is running on the target Amazon EC2 instance the Automation runbook doesn’t proceed. If an update is available the AWS-RunPatchBaseline install operation updates the affected packages identified in the patch install override list to the latest version available. Once the update completes the Automation runbook queries the Systems Manager for the State Manager association applied to the Amazon EC2 instance to gather software inventory using the AWS-GatherSoftwareInventory document. The association for AWS-GatherSoftwareInventory immediately initiates to apply on the Amazon EC2 instance to refresh inventory. The Amazon EC2 instance sends refreshed inventory information to AWS Systems Manager.

Amazon Inspector sets the remediated finding status to CLOSED if new patches are installed successfully. Security Hub’s corresponding finding record state sets to ARCHIVED.

Prerequisites

The required prerequisites are as follows:

Systems Manager must manage the Amazon EC2 instances. Enable Security Hub

Walkthrough

This walkthrough includes the following steps:

Create Security Hub custom actions for resolving Amazon Inspector Findings. Deploy the CloudFormation template for the Automation runbook. Create execution roles for multi-account and multi-Region using StackSets. Update EC2 IAM instance roles with permissions to access the install override list S3 bucket. Remediate vulnerabilities using the Security Hub custom action.

Step 1: Create Security Hub custom actions for resolving Amazon Inspector Findings

In the Security Hub delegated administrator account and Region navigate to the Security Hub console. In the left-hand navigation pane choose Settings and select the Custom actions tab. Choose Create custom action. For remediating Amazon Inspector findings without rebooting the EC2 instance perform the following steps:

Set the Action name to Rem-Inspector-NoRBT . Set the Description of the custom action such as Action that will remediate Amazon Inspector findings without restarting the instance. Set the Custom action ID to InspectorRemNoRBT .



Figure 4: Create Security Hub custom action for remediating findings without instance reboot

To create a second custom action for remediating Inspector findings and rebooting the EC2 instance perform the following steps:

Set the Action name to Rem-Inspector-RBT . Set the Description for the custom action such as Action that will remediate Amazon Inspector findings and reboot the EC2 instance. Set the Custom action ID to InspectorRemRBT .

Copy the custom action ARNs this will be used in the next step.

Figure 5: Security Hub custom action ARNs.

Step 2: Deploy the CloudFormation template for automation runbook

The AWS CloudFormation template provided with this post deploys the resources necessary to enable Amazon Inspector to find resolution in your AWS account. You must deploy these resources in your Security Hub delegated administrator account. The CloudFormation should be deployed only in the aggregator region if using Security Hub cross-region aggregation.

Open the following GitHub page and download the ResolveInspectorFindingsCFN.yaml file:

https://github.com/aws-samples/automate-vulnerability-management-and-remediation/blob/main/templates/resolveInspectorFindingsCFN.yaml

Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console in the Security Hub delegated administrator account and Region. Create a stack using the ResolveInspectorFindingsCFN.yaml

template file. On the Specify stack details page perform the following steps: Set the Stack name to a descriptive stack name. Set the RemediateInspectorFindingCustomActionNoRBTArn to the Security Hub custom action ARN copied in the previous section to remediate Amazon Inspector findings without rebooting the EC2 instance. Set the RemediateInspectorFindingCustomActionRBTArn to Security Hub custom action ARN copied in the previous section to remediate Amazon Inspector findings and reboot the EC2 instance. Set the OrganizationId to the Organization ID if deploying this template in the delegated administrator or management account. You can find your Organization ID by navigating to the AWS Organization console as illustrated below. Leave this field empty if deploying this template in a standalone account.



Figure 6: Organization’s console.

e. Choose Next

Figure 7: Stack details page.

On the Configure stack options page optionally add required tags and then choose Next. Review the parameters. Select I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names. Next choose Create Stack to submit your stack configuration. After refreshing the page the status of your stack should be CREATE_IN_PROGRESS. When the status changes to CREATE_COMPLETE proceed to the next section. You can view the resources created in the resources tab of the CloudFormation console. Copy the AutomationRunbookName and InstallOverrideListS3BucketName from the outputs tab of the CloudFormation console as illustrated below. You will use these in the following steps.

Figure 8: CloudFormation outputs tab.

Step 3: Create execution roles for multi-account and multi-Region automation using StackSet

You must create the Automation execution cross-account role for triggering this automation (deployed in previous step) from a delegated administrator account targeting Amazon EC2 instances in member accounts. Use the following steps to deploy the Automation execution role in all member accounts with EC2 instances using CloudFormation StackSets.

If you want to use this automation in a single account only you must create this role in the same AWS account used in Step 1.

Open the following GitHub page and download the automationExecutionRole.yml file.

https://github.com/aws-samples/automate-vulnerability-management-and-remediation/blob/main/templates/automationExecutionRole.yaml

Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console in the Organization management account or CloudFormation delegated administrator. From the navigation pane choose StackSets. At the top of the StackSets page choose Create StackSet. Under Prerequisite – Prepare template. Choose template is ready. Under Specify template select Upload a template file choose file choose the automationExecutionRole.yml and select Next. On the Specify stack details page perform the following steps:

Set the Stack name and the Description. Set the AutomationRunPatchBaselineRunbook to the runbook that you copied in point 6 of step 2. Set the DelegatedAdministratorAccountId to the Security Hub delegated administrator account ID. If deploying in a standalone account specify the targeted account ID. Set the InstallOverrideListBucket to the S3 bucket name that you copied in point 6 of step 2.

Figure 9: CloudFormation StackSet details.

On the Configure stack options page optionally add required tags and then choose Next. On the Set deployment options page select the desired Region. Since you’re creating IAM resources you only need to specify one region and then choose Next. Review all of the information. Select I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names. Next choose Submit to submit your stack configuration. After refreshing the page the status of your StackSet should be Running. When the status changes to Succeeded proceed to the next section. You can view the outcome of the individual Stack instances under the Stack instances tab of the CloudFormation StackSet console.

Step 4: Update EC2 IAM instance roles with permissions to access the install override list S3 bucket

The Amazon EC2 instances in the target accounts must have IAM permission to the install override lists located in the S3 bucket in the Security Hub delegated administrator account. The CloudFormation template from Step 1 creates this bucket. The following section contains a sample IAM policy required for the EC2 Instance Profile definition. This policy is needed in addition to IAM policies for Systems Manager to manage the resource.

You must update the bucket’s name in the resource section of the sample policy with the install override list bucket’s name that you copied in step 2 point 6 previously. You must add this permissions policy to all of the EC2 instance roles for instances where you want the ability to remediate Amazon Inspector findings using automation.

{ ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"" ""Statement"": [{ ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Action"": ""s3:GetObject"" ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:s3:::NameOfInstallOverrideListBucketHere/*"" }] }

Step 5: Remediate vulnerabilities using the Security Hub custom action

Let’s walk through using the Security Hub custom action to remediate an Amazon Inspector finding associated with an Amazon EC2 instance:

In the Security Hub Delegated administrator account navigate to the Security Hub console in the Region where you deployed Step 1 and go to the findings page.

Use the Title filter in Security Hub filter match type as starts with and enter the CVE you want to remediate. Use the Resource Type filter with AwsEc2Instance to only show findings associated with Amazon EC2 instances. Once these filters are selected Security Hub will show you all of the Amazon EC2 instances affected by the CVE. Select findings that you want to remediate and run the custom action. Select Rem-Inspector-RBT if you want to reboot the Amazon EC2 instance after installing the patch. If you don’t want to reboot the Amazon EC2 instance choose Rem-Inspector-NoRBT .

Figure 10: Security Hub findings page and custom action.

Once you select the custom action you will get a notification banner confirming EventBridge receives the events. You can monitor the progress of the Automation runbook for each of the findings selected in the Systems Manager Automation console under the Executions tab as shown in the following figure.

Figure 11: Systems Manager Automation execution status.

After patching the packages the Amazon Inspector findings update to the Closed status. You can view the closed Amazon Inspector findings on the All findings page on the Amazon Inspector console. Select Closed from the drop-down as shown in the following figure.

Figure 12: Amazon Inspector console for closed finding.

The vim package-related and dependency-related findings for the Amazon EC2 instance will be remediated and closed.

The corresponding Security Hub finding record state is set to ARCHIVED  as shown in the following figure.

Figure 13: Security Hub finding record state set to Archived.

Notes

This method will only remediate Amazon Inspector Package Vulnerability findings associated with Amazon EC2 instances. It doesn’t remediate Amazon Inspector Network reachability findings or Amazon Inspector Package Vulnerability findings related to container images in Amazon ECR. You can use the custom action to remediate one Amazon Inspector finding per Amazon EC2 instance at a time. However suppose the affected package resulted in multiple findings with different CVEs for the same EC2 instance. In that case all of the findings are remediated following a successful patching operation for the affected package. If you want to remediate inspector findings at scale refer to part 2 of this blog series. You can simultaneously trigger the custom action on multiple Amazon Inspector findings associated with different Amazon EC2 instances. We recommend filtering Amazon Inspector findings with a specific CVE in Security Hub and then running the custom action on every Amazon EC2 instance with the vulnerability as shown in Figure 2. The Automation runbook installs the latest version of the affected packages and is available in the package manager repositories.

Conclusion

This post discussed how the new Amazon Inspector can help you detect vulnerabilities in Amazon EC2 instances. We reviewed why on-demand patching methods are needed to remediate zero-day and critical vulnerabilities. Finally we walked through an automation method using the Security Hub custom action to remediate Inspector findings for package vulnerabilities on selected Amazon EC2 instances affected by a specific CVE. This automation can help you reduce the operational complexity of manual updates reduce errors and increase the remediation speed.

You can use the Security Hub custom actions Rem-Inspector-RBT and Rem-Inspector-NoRBT to remediate the same vulnerability across multiple Amazon EC2 instances across an AWS Organization.

In Part 2 we’ll show you how to use the Systems Manager Automation runbook directly from the Automation console to remediate the Amazon Inspector findings for Amazon EC2 instances at scale across an AWS organization based on resource tag and Amazon Inspector finding severity.

Ardern who spoke at Harvard’s commencement on Thursday also visited with Microsoft executives including Microsoft President Brad Smith on her visit to Seattle.

Microsoft recently announced a new partnership with the country and is also building data centers in New Zealand.

Other tech and startup leaders from New Zealand joined Ardern on her visit to Seattle including Sam Kidd CEO of LawVu which recently announced a new Seattle office.

“I’m excited about continuing our investment here in Seattle” Kidd wrote in a LinkedIn post about his time in the Emerald City. “The unapologetic mindset people have here around building and growing a company is both exciting and refreshing.

Ameren says it provides electricity for 1.2 million customers in Illinois.

The actual cost increases will vary with some groups involved estimating lower increases.

Bob Kuzman is a representative of Midcontinent Independent System Operator the electric grid that encompases the Midwest. In a legislative hearing on Thursday he said increases would be around $430 per year with higher prices in the summer months.

“Every individual customer is different” said Kuzman. “If you use more the estimate is likely going to be higher for you if you use less the estimate is likely going to be less for you.”

The increase is the result of an interconnected system of companies government agencies and the energy market.

“Wholesale electricity prices are strongly correlated to natural gas prices and global and national trends have been pushing prices up” said Anthony Starr the director of the Illinois Power Agency.

The IPA buys electricity from electricity producers at wholesale prices and provides it to Illinois’ “delivery-only” utilities.

“As a delivery-only company Ameren Illinois is required by law to fulfill the pricing contracts established by the IPA and pass that cost along to our customers dollar-for-dollar” said Marcelyn Love a spokesperson for Ameren Illinois.

These cost increases are due to several factors but the technology used to generate electricity is currently undergoing a sea change responsible for much of the price instability.

“This is just a byproduct of a national transition to clean energy that is going on today” said Jim Blessing vice president of regulatory policy and energy supply for Ameren Illinois at Thursday’s legislative hearing. “I’m not taking an opinion on the merits of that policy direction but that is a significant driving force.”

Under an Illinois law passed last year the Climate & Equitable Jobs Act all fossil fuel power plants will be forced to close by 2045 23 years from now.

Beyond Illinois market forces and regulations are forcing owners of fossil fuel power plants to shut down or schedule plant retirements around the country.

S&P Global Market Analytics has projected that coal plants around the country will continue to close with 2028 set to see a record number of coal plant closures thanks to a change in federal regulations at the Environmental Protection Agency.

This transition particularly in Illinois is leaving what Melissa Seymour the vice president of external affairs for MISO calls “the gap.”

“There is a gap between when the facilities are retiring and when we have replacements online” said Seymour.

This gap means that it will be difficult for the grid operator and power companies to provide steady service to their customers.

“We’d like to see a better bridge to the new future a more transitional view of how we get there” she later added.

Fluctuations in electricity prices and insufficient generation mean that consumers face increased risks of “temporary controlled outages to maintain system reliability” according to Clair Moeller MISO’s president and chief operating officer.

This prospect has upset some downstate politicians in Illinois. Rep. Dan Caulkins R-Decatur is a member of both the House Energy & Environment and Public Utilities committees.

“People are going to suffer” he said on Thursday. “People are going to die.”

Caulkins called on the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to ease its regulations on gas-fired power plants to allow them to burn more gas and make up the difference in electric generation.

Environmental advocates say that to blame the increased prices on the push for renewable energy sources is simplistic and misses larger trends.

“These high prices are driven by market forces that are affecting the whole nation and the world but also by missed opportunities to deploy affordable clean energy resources here in Illinois” said JC Kibbey a representative of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Kibbey also noted that 14 coal plants have closed since 2010 with all of the closures announced before Illinois’ recent law requiring plants to close before 2045. These closures the war in Ukraine and the complex and slow approval process for renewable energy projects have all contributed to the costs of electricity.

For families in Illinois seeking relief from the increased electric prices Ameren is offering lowered down payments on extended payment plans through July 31. More information can be found at their website AmerenIllinois.com/EnergyAssistance.

The state of Illinois also offers funding to help low-income households through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The deadline to apply for assistance is Tuesday and must be done by contacting county-level agencies.

My question is about airlines switching itineraries a huge frustration for me since returning to travel after a pandemic pause. I will book a direct flight at a good time and then get an email days or weeks later with an inconvenient time change or an added layover or both. The worst was when I was planning a trip with my daughter to Tampa Fla. In January I booked a direct flight on Southwest Airlines that left Hartford Conn. at 12:30 p.m. on April 17 and arrived in Tampa three hours later. Perfect. But on Feb. 15 Southwest emailed that they had moved me onto a 6:15 p.m. flight with a nearly three-hour layover in Nashville getting me to Tampa at 1:10 a.m.! Why is this OK? It’s like I bought a nice Subaru Forester and they delivered a dilapidated and rusty Trans Am and told me it was the only option. Phoebe Massachusetts

Dear Phoebe

Leave it to airlines to make car dealerships seem transparent by comparison. While you could certainly sue your fictional dealer for breach of contract the real Southwest was within their contractual rights to cancel your original flight and put you on that midnight plane from Nashville.

There’s no law against an airline unilaterally changing your itinerary and in such cases the main rule the U.S. government requires the airlines to follow is a flimsy one. If a carrier imposes a new itinerary on a customer that would result in a “significant delay” the company must offer you a refund in your case $264 each for two “Wanna Get Away” fares Southwest’s equivalent of economy class.

They did but as you told me over Zoom canceling the trip wouldn’t do: You wanted to go to Florida and had already arranged lodging. The airline gave you another option saying you could search for an alternative Southwest itinerary then make the change online or through customer service (which you did painfully as we’ll get to later).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtMTItaG91ci1mbGlnaHQtZGZ3LWxheC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ouch: American Airlines' 12-Hour Flight From DFW To LAX,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtMTItaG91ci1mbGlnaHQtZGZ3LWxheC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533DD14A00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtMTItaG91ci1mbGlnaHQtZGZ3LWxheC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcmV0LmNvbS9mYWl0aC8yMDIyLzUvMjkvMjMxNDQ0NDQvZG9lcy1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtYW1lcmljYS1ob2xkLWtleXMtdG8tcmVsaWdpb3VzLWluY2x1c2lvbi1yZWxpZ2lvdXMtZGl2ZXJzaXR5LWVxdWl0eS1pbmNsdXNpb24taW5kZXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Accenture other Fortune 500 companies praised for faith,"Corporate America might seem like an unlikely place to look for ways to heal our country’s divisions. But the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation’s third annual Religious Equity Inclusion and Diversity Index shows that some of the nation’s biggest companies are getting it right when it comes to bringing together Americans of different faiths.

This year’s survey which was the largest to date assessed how Fortune 500 companies in the United States approach religious issues. American Airlines came out on top claiming the Religious Equity Inclusion and Diversity Index’s No. 1 spot for its efforts.

Other familiar names crowded the top 10 including Intel Dell Texas Instruments and Google. Among the additional corporations surveyed which included Global Fortune 500 companies and other businesses the information technology company Accenture took first place.

The companies that ranked the highest on the Religious Equity Inclusion and Diversity Index have some common approaches according to Brian Grim the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation’s founding president.

“They’re not just ticking a box and having a faith-based ERG (employee resource group) or covering religious discrimination in their training. They’re having a holistic approach to religious inclusion” said Grim who added that the most successful corporations aren’t “just inward focused but are also willing to share their experiences with other companies.”

Businesses that want to do better in this area should look to other companies to help. “What really is the change agent is the company to company transfer of knowledge” said Grim.

The spirit of openness — of sharing and learning — is a core component of cultivating an inclusive environment of any kind.

During Ramadan for example the digital infrastructure company Equinix which ranked sixth on this year’s index held several panels to help employees better understand the Muslim holiday. During a 2021 panel organized by Equinix — and attended by employees from Google Salesforce PayPal and Apple — Muslim employees shared childhood memories of Ramadan said Marsie Sweetland founder of Equinix’s FaithConnect initiative. The panel included a segment during which non-Muslim employees had the opportunity to ask questions like “‘What do we say? Happy Ramadan?’”

Participants also received practical suggestions about how to be culturally sensitive said Sweetland. “During Ramadan it might not be time to have a luncheon” she said. “If you do pack to-go boxes so Muslim employees can take them home” to eat after they break their fast.

Sweetland also moderated a Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur panel during which participants learned among other things not to wish Jews a “Happy Yom Kippur” as it is a solemn day of atonement.

To really succeed in fostering religious diversity equity and inclusion corporations need to go beyond increasing employees’ awareness of religious traditions. They need to take other concrete actions as well said Sumreen Ahmad Accenture’s global change management lead and the company’s North America interfaith lead.

“You really need to be bold in this space” said Ahmad. “It’s not just saying that this is important — it’s bold leadership taking actions that are needed (like) creating prayer space making sure there is a drop down (on menus) that allows me to select halal or kosher food.”

Taking such steps fosters “a community of belonging so (employees) can lead from their authentic self” she said.

Efforts to cultivate religious diversity equity and inclusion aren’t just about making employees feel good — there’s a bottom line benefit as well Grim said.

“Corporate culture matters” he said.

Not only does a more welcoming environment help companies recruit talent it’s also a key to retaining employees Grim added. Having a top-down exclusive grindstone culture saps employees’ motivation. Employees need to feel like their experiences and input are valued and like they’re part of shaping the company.

“If you feel like you don’t belong your ideas don’t belong your creativity doesn’t belong your beliefs don’t belong — if you are getting the message that you don’t belong then you’ll leave it and yourself at the door and find another door to go in” said Grim.

Addressing faith can influence product development which is also good for the bottom line Grim added pointing out that worldwide about 8 in 10 people are religious.

Religion is an up-and-coming topic when it comes to equity diversity and inclusion. Asked what other aspects of diversity companies should consider addressing Ahmad and Sweetland had some ideas.

Ahmad said her company is tackling socioeconomic diversity in a number of ways including attempts to recruit in geographically marginalized areas. “We’re going into these communities that are farther away from the big cities because there’s talent there” she said.

Not only would a socioeconomic employee resource group be productive Sweetland thought that Middle East and North Africa is an oft-overlooked diversity category as well. “MENA would also be a great ERG. We have seen a few and have heard of a few popping up” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF0bGFudGljLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlL2FyY2hpdmUvMjAyMi8wNS9wbGFuZS1zZWF0LXVwZ3JhZGUtcHJlbWl1bS1lY29ub215LzY1NTA1OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why You're So Tempted by the Premium-Economy Upgrade,"This article was featured in One Story to Read Today a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.

Let’s say you receive an unexpected financial windfall. What’s the first thing you’re spending money on? If it’s a lavish vacation—how are you getting there? Americans top the list of consumers who say they’re interested in private travel so there’s a clue. Many of us would prefer to opt out of the commercial-flight experience but the odds of hailing a private jet are lottery-long for anyone not in the 1 percent. Still that doesn’t mean that commercial flying is devoid of its own cutthroat class system.

As with life at ground level social mobility in the sky is secured by money and a slew of secondary considerations like “loyalty” that also mean money. The majority of us find ourselves on the bottom rung—the main cabin which accounts for roughly 70 percent of the seats on a Boeing 737. And airlines don’t let us forget it. Every boarding-zone call registers our lowly station sorting passengers with all the sensitivity of industrial farm equipment. Every full overhead bin mocks our sad aftward shuffle past first or business class. On occasion some of us get to ride the company card to relative comfort but when you’re flying on your own dime you’re more than likely facing the bald reality of economy seat 28F.

Or maybe just maybe you reach a little deeper into your pocket and cough up the bones to relocate to a slightly sexier neighborhood: premium economy. Though not as plush as a business-class berth premium (which goes by different names depending on the airline) delivers various creature comforts—a few extra inches of legroom or a toiletry kit with Malin+Goetz products or a “chef-inspired” meal with craft beer to name a few perks across carriers. In recent years an emerging subset of fliers has signaled enthusiasm for premium economy’s marginally more refined service. “One of the trends that everyone in the airline industry is talking about nowadays especially coming out of the pandemic is a greater willingness on the part of leisure travelers to buy a premium economy seat” Rob Britton an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and a former managing director of American Airlines told me. Business travel airlines’ usual bread and butter fell off a cliff in 2020 and these companies now see a lifeline in Millennial yuppies. “The 35-year-old couples going to Paris are filling the gap.”

In the mid-aughts when a major aircraft manufacturer was designing a new model it studied the cost per square-inch of real estate in the most expensive markets: New York Paris London. Then it looked at the cost per square-inch on airplanes. There was no comparison Uzma Khan a marketing professor at the University of Miami told me. “From an airline’s perspective what is the most expensive thing for them to give you? Real estate in the air.” In that regard airlines operate as a kind of landlord calculating the expense of hurtling a single passenger from one place to another and adding a healthy upcharge on top.

Historically the seats in the front of the plane subsidized operations as besuited flyers from the likes of Bain and Deloitte and Baker McKenzie reliably bought more expensive business-class tickets. Still carriers clung to thin margins. And in 2008 rising fuel costs and sagging demand prompted airlines to decouple standard amenities from economy tickets in order to keep their prices competitive. Over time they made it up not just by selling credit-card miles corporate contracts and cargo but also by using premium economy to sell the faint whiff of pampering to vacationers like Kelsey Masters a project manager who lives in New York.

By her own admission Masters is terrified of flying but she makes frequent cross-country trips to see friends and family. She described her purchase habits to me with a weary acceptance that characterizes her overall feelings on pandemic air travel: “Screw it. Sixty bucks to upgrade? I get a little more legroom and a free drink and I can just be a little more calm? That sounds like a really good thing right now.” Rather than splurge in the planning stage she tries to buy the cheapest fare ahead of time and let the circumstances of the travel day guide her upgrade decisions. Compounding stressors from the airport the trip itself or even a few nights of fitful sleep on a friend’s living-room pullout “will make me start to reevaluate the opportunity cost of the dollar” she said.

Premium economy has become a major revenue driver for the airlines which according to Counterpoint Market Intelligence an aerospace market research company are projected to triple their inventory of premium seats by 2025. But travelers like Masters weren’t the original target. Britton explained that premium economy wasn’t built to entice strivers across flight-class lines; carriers originally designed it to catch the bruised egos of former business-class members when the corporate world began to earnestly self-audit and downgrade employee travel budgets. A recent report by Jay Sorensen an industry consultant noted that “the apparent discovery of a new type of upscale leisure traveler” is a welcome surprise for these airlines. It connoted a small miracle: Airlines had once again wrung a new social class from flying as they had done with first and business class. And they were able to do it in part because of a phenomenon called “pain of payment.”

According to Khan people often experience “actual physical pain” upon paying for something. But humans can have short memories. If airlines create enough distance between the initial ticket purchase and the option to upgrade passengers are more likely to think of the latter as a stand-alone cost. “A lot of upgrades happen because now you’re either at the airport or you’re checking in and they give you an option. You don’t even remember exactly how much you paid for your flight when you were booking it so that pain is gone” Khan said. Basically you don’t consider the total amount because you’ve already internalized the initial amount.

At the point of travel an extra $45 or so to improve a short-haul flight—however modestly—doesn’t seem so decadent especially when the threat of suffering through basic economy looms. Back in 2014 the antitrust scholar Tim Wu coined the phrase calculated misery to describe the conditions of basic economy positing that airlines deliberately provide substandard service to coerce customers into paying for amenities that previously were free—seat selection checked baggage and itinerary changes for instance. “It’s just a matter of physical discomfort translating into an emotional debt” says Wesley Kang a co-founder of Nimble Made an e-commerce clothing brand who flies frequently for leisure and family visits. “The less you move around the less you have to adjust the less inconsiderate you’re being to the person next to you.”

There is of course another prevailing opinion about premium economy which is that it’s simply a ham-fisted attempt to get passengers to pay more for a negligibly better experience. This attitude puts the pomp and puffery of premium economy into sharp relief. A seat upgrade after all does not get you to your destination any more quickly or safely. Research bears that line of thinking out to an extent. Khan mentioned several studies that were conducted to determine the extent to which space colored the overall experience for passengers. An aircraft manufacturer brought in focus groups to try different seat configurations on its prototype sometimes offering more legroom sometimes more elbow room. “It had zero impact on customer satisfaction” Khan said. “Where people do feel the difference is if you give them four more inches at the eye level. Because the perception of space is what matters.”

One could posit that the rise of premium economy was culturally foretold. The coveted Millennial-yuppie flier laying their claim to “nicer” seats falls in line with the idea that they’re bold go-getters who seek experiences over things. Plus the confluence of pandemic exhaustion discretionary income and the aforementioned “screw it” attitude toward purchasing small luxuries creates the perfect environment for low-stakes indulgence. Despite what travelers may know about seat-upgrade marketing tactics many still think the extra spend is worth it. And perception is reality. Airlines it turns out have figured out how to bank on that fact.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbGFza2FhaXIuY29tL2NvbW11bml0eS9hbGFza2EtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWFhbmhwaS1tb250aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alaska employees go the extra mile to support AANHPI communities end Asian hate,"This May during Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month we recognize the history and achievements of Asian Americans Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders across our network. Story by Shanyn Wright and Maria Cid Alaska Airlines

Alaska Airlines stands against hate and violence of any kind. We remain appalled and heartbroken to see violent and racists attacks and harassment continue throughout the country including those in the AANHPI community.

To help create meaningful change and in recognition of AANHPI month a group of Alaska employees recently flew to Washington D.C. to facilitate conversations among lawmakers to discuss matters close to AANHPI communities.

Leaders of Alaska’s Air Group Pan Asian (AGPA) and Pacific Islander Alliance (PIA) Business Resource Groups (BRGs) met with several policymakers and national leaders to discuss topics ranging from rising anti-Asian hate crimes to increasing representation.

“It was a strong way for us to show up not just for our BRG members and employees but also for our communities” says Lindsay a PIA leader. “Opportunities like this empower us to use our collective voice and engage on a national level which feels incredible to bring back and share with others.”

Meeting with Deputy Assistant to the President and AANHPI Senior Liaison to the White House Erika Moritsugu was a trip highlight for our employees. Moritsugu and BRG leaders discussed the administration’s support of AANHPI interests.

Our communities are so diverse; we all need to be heard” said AGPA co-leader Nia. “I felt energized by Erika’s dedication to ensuring we’re represented on the local state and federal levels.”

For decades Alaska has championed employee-organized groups like BRGs that celebrate and advocate diversity equity and inclusion at the company.

These groups are critical in helping us build an inclusive culture that supports and moves us closer to our goal of inclusion and belonging for all. They also play a key role in helping us increase our Inclusion Index Score which holds us accountable to our DEI commitments.

BRGs such as AGPA and PIA create safe spaces for employees to engage and support one another while celebrating and advocating for cultures causes and other initiatives our employees care about.

Meeting at the table for delicious cuisine and deep conversations in San Francisco

Recently a group of influential Bay Area members of the AANHPI community gathered at Alaska’s San Francisco Lounge to discuss the current climate and share ways to make our neighborhoods safer and better for everyone.

Vietnamese American and Season 15 Top Chef Tu David Phu was an honorary guest.

“I’ve felt so unseen for the longest time and to have a strong internationally recognized brand like Alaska Airlines say ‘We believe and support Asian American identities’ I have never felt more seen in my life” said Phu.

Among those ‘at the SFO table’ were youth activist Ashlyn So 13 who helped organize Stop Asian hate rallies in the Bay Area Carl Chan who is the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce President and advocacy manager Shanti Prasad of the Stop AAPI Hate coalition.

The event also celebrated AANHPI Month with the culmination of authentic Vietnamese dishes made by Chef Tu Phu as well as desserts made by Bay Area Asian American business owners. At the heart of every Asian culture are the gatherings that occur around food.

By elevating the voices of the AANHPI community we are not only celebrating our beautiful cultures we are raising awareness about the diversity within our communities and the alarming rise in xenophobia which has resulted in heinous crimes against innocent people” said Edrea an AGPA leader who was in attendance. “Education is the key to breaking down barriers and these events allow our community to be visible.”"
AEP,American Electric Power,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcmVjb2RlLzIzMTQ0Njk2L3RleGFzLWdyaWQtZW5lcmd5LW1hcmtldC1ibGFja291dHMtaGVhdHdhdmUtd2ludGVyLXN0b3Jt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the Texas power grid is vulnerable to blackouts during winter storms and heat waves,"According to the calendar it’s not yet summer in the Northern Hemisphere. But in many parts of the world the weather would indicate otherwise. A crippling heat wave created the hottest spring on record in India and Pakistan. Europe saw a heat wave of its own in May with the temperature reaching historic highs across the continent. And in the United States? Surprise: unprecedented heat wave! Dozens of states saw spring temperatures at the highest they’ve ever been. In Texas the heat was bad enough to knock six power plants offline forcing state regulators to ask residents to help avoid a blackout by turning up their thermostats.

So how about that weather?

The culprit is pretty clear. Recent research has shown climate change made the South Asian heat wave 30 times more likely to happen and it’s very likely the same will be true for the European and American heat waves. The peak of summer could be even worse. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts above-average temperatures in June July and August for most of the lower 48.

Texas may be the most vulnerable of those 48. Most states in the continental US are connected to power grids that sprawl across state (and at times even international) lines. But Texas is somewhat infamously an energy island: It operates a power grid that’s mostly disconnected from the rest of the country. Depending on whom you ask this has its advantages and disadvantages. Keeping the Texas grid disconnected from the rest of the country means it won’t fall under federal regulations as grids that cross state lines do. But it also means Texas can’t borrow power from other states when its power infrastructure fails as it did in February 2021 when Winter Storm Uri hit knocking out power across the state for days. Hundreds of people died as a result.

Experts are worried something similar could happen this summer. Electricity use tends to peak in the summer in most of the United States when people crank up their air conditioners. As rising temperatures force people inside for longer stretches of time and as ACs work harder against more punishing heat the American grid — which already isn’t prepared for climate change — will be pushed to its breaking point trying to keep up with energy demand. This May the North American Electric Reliability Corporation announced that several parts of North America are at “elevated or high risk” of blackouts thanks to the deadly combination of heat and a historic drought in the West. In California officials warned that climate change could cause blackouts in the state for the next five summers.

In the wake of Winter Storm Uri many people — myself included — discussed infrastructural fixes that could help fix the Texas grid to prevent future blackouts. Mose Buchele an energy and environmental reporter at KUT the NPR affiliate in Austin focused on something else in a recent investigation. The real problem with the Texas grid Buchele found isn’t just the state’s infrastructure. It’s also the system of which that infrastructure is a part. Buchele dove deep into the history of how the Texas grid came to be in The Disconnect: Power Politics and the Texas Blackout a podcast based on his findings.

I recently spoke to Buchele about how the Texas grid is set up to constantly teeter on the edge of failure one misstep away from a blackout. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Neel Dhanesha

In your podcast you said something I found fascinating: that infrastructure was just one part of the cause of the blackouts last year. Instead you pointed to the energy market in Texas and how it works. Why was that so important to you?

Mose Buchele

A little over 20 years ago Texas deregulated its energy market. And Texas is not unique in that; deregulation obviously has been kind of the story of American policy for decades. And it came to the electricity market in Texas as it did to other states. But in Texas it took a form that we do not see anywhere else. Essentially they created a competitive market where supply and demand are the rule of the day. There’s no one power company that you go to like there is in a lot of the country. You get these competing electric providers. But the real thing that makes Texas unique is that it is what they call an “energy-only market.”

In other parts of the country a power plant also known as a generator gets paid to be around in case they’re needed. But in Texas in an attempt to create this kind of perfect competitive market they said “No you’re only going to make money by selling electricity at the time that it is needed at its time of use.” So our generators only make money selling power on the market.

When you take that approach and you couple it with the law of supply and demand what you’re doing is you’re creating a system that is run on scarcity. The less electricity that is available the more expensive it will be. So in our market we created a system where power plant operators make their margins by relying on moments of extreme scarcity that will drive up the price of electricity. And this will be their big payday. These moments may only come a handful of times a year but this is where you make your money.

Proponents of this market said that it incentivizes efficiency. Like you cut out all the fat and you don’t have any electricity generators that are getting paid to just sit around. They would claim that that creates an efficient market. The reality though is that when you need extra power on hand you have less of it available.

Neel Dhanesha

I think the way you described it in your show was that the lack of extra supply means the grid is constantly running on a knife’s edge.

Mose Buchele

One of the things that’s been really wild for me to see happen in the aftermath of the 2021 blackout is the rhetoric around this market. I’ve been an energy reporter for years and years and the Texas system was always held up as a kind of point of pride by politicians in power and regulators and industry people. We had this unique thing that was uniquely Texan and had created this efficient market. And in the aftermath of the blackout it didn’t take long for a lot of the same people to suddenly start saying “Oh we have a crisis-driven market. We need to overhaul this market we need to reform things so that it is now more focused on reliability.”

They were making all these promises they were going to change things. But — and this is where it gets really kind of confounding — they wanted to change things without actually overhauling the system. So their argument is that we are keeping our unique energy-only market but we are also going to provide greater reliability within that framework. But the question right now is like how do you do that? Or even can you do that? I’ve interviewed a lot of experts in the world of energy that just are not buying it right now.

Neel Dhanesha

Right it seems hard to motivate people to build extra power generators if the market disincentivizes them. Maybe this is a dumb question but are there backup power plants in Texas that could turn on in case of blackouts?

Mose Buchele

Not really the way you might be thinking of them. They have these things called peaker plants that only run when electricity is really really expensive because that’s the only time they can make a profit. A lot of times these are even still coal plants and these power plants are getting old. It doesn’t make sense to keep these things shipshape for most of the year. But you could go out to some rickety old coal plant around mid-July and get it geared up for August when you can reliably expect the price of electricity to spike to its cap. Then you run that plant as hard as you can through those super hot months. You try to make a bunch of money and then you basically shut it down again until the next August. I guess it’s backup power of a sort but it’s market-driven.

There was a proposal in the last legislative session to actually create a fleet of natural gas power plants that would only run as we approached an energy emergency kind of like a generator you keep in your garage and only run when the power goes out. But that didn’t go anywhere. It was expensive and some people saw it as a kind of way of secretly reintroducing a regulated utility structure to Texas. This would have been a government-regulated fleet of power plants that would come and save the day when the system crashed. And I think that was probably kind of politically difficult to sell people on in Austin at the legislature.

Neel Dhanesha

It almost sounds like part of the problem is that it would require acknowledging that something about the system itself is broken or at least prone to crashing.

Mose Buchele

Yes and that really seems to be one of the big challenges for the officials that are trying to wrap their heads around this now. They need to say “The old system was a failure and we’re fixing it” without saying that it’s a failure and it needs fixing.

Neel Dhanesha

How do renewables fit into this picture if they fit into the picture at all? I know that Texas is a big wind power hub. Would those turbines keep working during blackouts like the one in 2021?

Mose Buchele

Even before last year’s storm was over the governor was trying to lay blame on renewables. And that was just not the case. The big blackout was the result of a massive failure primarily with our natural gas fleet of power plants and the natural gas system more broadly speaking — the pipelines and the wells and everything.

That was an example of a political battle that’s been going on in Texas as it has nationally for a long time now. Renewable energy is kind of ascendant in Texas right now. We are the wind leader of the country and I think we’re going to be the solar leader of the country in a short amount of time. Integrating those energy sources does pose challenges to the grid it’s not something you can just flip a switch and not think about because they are different forms of energy.

Neel Dhanesha

One of the issues you highlighted in The Disconnect was that natural gas infrastructure froze during Winter Storm Uri. Wouldn’t wind turbines or solar power help mitigate that problem?

Mose Buchele

It depends on who you talk to. If you talk to people who analyze the energy system they will agree. But the opposition is not generally based on the research or on the science. This is a political battle. It’s kind of an extension of a fight between industries. The oil and gas industry has been the dominant industry in Texas for generations and they have an incredible amount of power over state politicians. So I don’t know that you’re going to hear a lot of good-faith debate around this from Texas politicians right now.

Renewable energy sources have helped us in a lot of these energy scarcity events that we’ve seen recently. Just in this really hot spring we’ve had solar power really really help. And it was — just like in last year’s winter storm — natural gas power plants suddenly breaking down that put us close to a crisis. It had nothing to do with renewables. We have installed a really impressive amount of solar just in the last year since the February blackout. That really is going to be essential to keeping us from blackouts going through the summer which a lot of people are worried about. We’re expecting a really hot dry summer.

Neel Dhanesha

If cold was the issue during the blackouts last year why is heat the issue right now? There’s a lot of talk about winterization of natural gas infrastructure in the wake of the winter storm in 2021. Does heat have a similar effect on infrastructure or is it just about demand?

Mose Buchele

Energy use is primarily driven through residential heating and cooling. Our highest energy use days in Texas are typically in the summer when it gets really really really hot. But likewise in an event like the 2021 storm it can skyrocket when it’s really really cold. That’s because people are just desperately trying to heat and cool their houses.

In Texas power plants are built kind of open-air because the real threat has always been overheating. That was one of the things that really got us during the freeze: These power plants had not been weatherized to withstand that type of cold. Likewise as things heat up in the state they need to start taking some of that insulation off and trying to make sure that these things can operate in hotter weather — and the weather is just getting hotter and hotter. We are in the middle of a historically hot May. It feels like summer here already and in Texas that means really really hot. So there’s a lot of anxiety about what this summer is going to bring.

Neel Dhanesha

Are there other ways climate change is affecting the Texas grid aside from people running their air conditioners more?

Mose Buchele

Power plants in Texas have historically relied on what they call “shoulder months” to do their maintenance. These are times in the spring and in the fall where the weather is mild in the state and we don’t need many power plants at the ready because people aren’t really using their air conditioning or heat that much. Climate change means that those times are much more limited and much less predictable.

This raises concerns that the state’s aging fleet of power plants are maybe being run too hard. For example it was a political imperative through the winter that we not have another blackout and that required power generators to be at the ready at all times. That meant these plants didn’t have a chance to do regular maintenance. One of the plants that failed this month actually requested to shut down for maintenance that request was denied and then it broke down.

Neel Dhanesha

Now for the big question: What’s the fix?

Mose Buchele

There isn’t just one fix. There are a lot of different things put together that could really help the situation. I think the most obvious one — the one that you don’t have to be a grid engineer to understand — is increasing interconnections between Texas and other neighboring grids. I’ve read very convincing analyses that say that if we were better connected we still would have had blackouts in 2021 but they would not have been nearly as catastrophic as they were. They would not have lasted as long because after day one maybe day two we could have started pulling more power from other states and gotten people’s lights back on faster and the kind of intensity of that disaster could have been muted.

There’s virtually no appetite to do that it seems on the part of state regulators and political leaders in part because that would open up the state to federal regulation which is just a non-starter for them.

Neel Dhanesha

Beto O’Rourke who’s running for Texas governor recently tweeted about connecting Texas to the national grid so it looks like there’s some support from Democrats.

Mose Buchele

Oh yes. When I say political leaders I mean the Republican leadership the people with the power right now.

Neel Dhanesha

Let’s say Texas did join one of the larger grids on the eastern or western interconnect. Texas generates a lot of energy so I imagine it could potentially help other states when things are running smoothly. But would the other states be able to keep up with the sort of demand Texas would bring?

Mose Buchele

[Laughs] I’ve heard the argument that’s like why would anyone want to link up with a basket case like the Texas grid? And the way that this would work would be that the power would first go closer to the source first if it was needed. You wouldn’t export power to Texas and leave people in the state of origin freezing.

The frustrating thing for a lot of people that I talk to is that we are a wind juggernaut and we often have more wind power than we can use. We’re also in a part of the country where that power could be pushed out to answer the energy needs of other states. And people could make a ton of money in Texas by pushing that energy out when we don’t need it. The reluctance to do that seems to transcend economics because it is a huge business opportunity for the state that we’re passing up on.

Neel Dhanesha

Okay so connecting Texas to the larger grid could help prevent blackouts and potentially even push more renewable energy out into the rest of the country. That’s the big one. Are there any other fixes that you would want to see?

Mose Buchele

I don’t want to be too techno-utopian about this but investing in things like battery storage that would allow us to make renewable energy more dispatchable seems like a no-brainer. Building out solar is huge because we usually use the most electricity in the summer. And the conditions that drive that high energy use (i.e. the state being baked by the sun) are the exact same conditions that create a ton of solar electricity. So that seems like a pretty obvious one to try to meet that super-high demand.

Another thing is energy efficiency. The energy efficiency goals in Texas are lower than most other states and increasing our energy efficiency goals and programs would really help with grid reliability because it would decrease the spikes in demand. I’m thinking of everything from insulation to more efficient appliances to energy efficiency at power plants because it takes so much energy to produce power or drill for oil. If you have a better-insulated home you’re just not going to be running the AC the same amount even on a hot day so in aggregate it can make a huge difference statewide. And it’s so much cheaper than anything else.

Neel Dhanesha

Who would pay for those sorts of improvements?

Mose Buchele

It’s tricky. I always wonder what the incentives are here you know because we have a system where people make money selling power. You have to imagine that there’s some opposition to efficiency just in the name of profit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMjkwNTIwMjIvY29hbC1jYXJib24tY2FwdHVyZS13eW9taW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In a Bid to Save Its Coal Industry Wyoming Has Become a Test Case for Carbon Capture but Utilities are Balking at the ...,"Pipe Dreams: Fourth in a continuing series on whether capturing carbon is a climate solution or a dangerous distraction.

Wyoming has bet its future on carbon capture technology.

The state has poured money into research on how to remove carbon dioxide from industrial emissions and what to do with the gas once it has been captured. State lawmakers have passed laws to encourage carbon capture and regulations to govern it.

As many other states and nations have tried to wean themselves off fossil fuels Wyoming has done the opposite: In 2020 Gov. Mark Gordon signed a law—the first in the nation—that requires electrical utilities to generate some of their power from coal plants fitted with carbon capture equipment.

Wyoming produces 40 percent of the nation’s coal and relies on fossil fuels to generate nearly 60 percent of state and local revenues. The goal has been to find a way for the coal industry to thrive even as the nation reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

But two years later Wyoming may be no closer to willing this coal-friendly climate solution into being. In March the utilities covered by the law submitted filings to regulators saying that carbon capture was not economically feasible. Retrofitting their plants would cost hundreds of millions of dollars at the least they said forcing them to raise customers’ electricity bills.

Beyond that the filings said operating carbon capture equipment could spike water use at the coal plants and increase emissions of some air pollutants as well as solid and liquid waste.

Energy companies labor unions and each of the last four presidential administrations have held out carbon capture and storage as a technology that could help the nation reduce greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to burn fossil fuels. The technology has played an important role in the Biden administration’s climate policy.

Last year’s infrastructure bill included more than $12 billion to help pull carbon dioxide from smokestack emissions and straight from the atmosphere. Some states have also joined in: California recently said it will rely partly on carbon capture to meet its climate targets though primarily in the industrial sector rather than for electrical generation.

Nowhere is the support as strong as in Wyoming which is an ideal testing ground. The state has abundant coal reserves and the right geology to store captured carbon dioxide. Perhaps most importantly the technology has the unequivocal backing of political leaders who have stated their intention to use carbon capture to protect their coal industry.

“We put all our eggs in one basket” said Dan Zwonitzer who sponsored the 2020 carbon capture bill. “We champion coal. And so if we’re going to do that we’ve got to find ways to make sure it can carry us into the future. And I think CCUS is a way that we need to find” he said using an acronym for carbon capture utilization and storage.

Yet so far the technology has failed to catch on commercially there or elsewhere. And many economists and policy experts say it is unlikely to play a significant role in helping eliminate emissions from the power sector. “There are so many other cheaper and cleaner ways to decarbonize electricity that I don’t see carbon capture as likely to have a big role” said Dan Cohan an associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University. “The economics just don’t make sense.”

Some carbon capture companies have disputed the negative conclusions of the two Wyoming utilities Rocky Mountain Power and Black Hills Energy that submitted the filings. Other supporters of the technology say the analysis is sound but that the world will need carbon capture on coal plants to meet climate goals and that the federal government should bear the costs.

But the Wyoming filings make clear that even with conditions primed in favor of the technology the utilities would rather convert their coal plants to burn natural gas or simply close them down than install carbon capture equipment. And even Zwonitzer concedes that the 2020 bill he sponsored is far from achieving its goal.

“We are not where we thought we’d be three years ago” he said “and I’m not sure where we’re going over the next year.”

Wyoming’s Climate Plan

In October of 2019 PacifiCorp which owns Rocky Mountain Power accelerated the timeline for closing four units at two of its Wyoming coal plants. The nation’s coal production was continuing to slide and states were passing bills aiming to speed their transitions off fossil fuel power.

“We thought ‘OK that’s one way for a state to do it’” said Randall Luthi chief energy adviser to Gov. Gordon. But the problem wasn’t really coal Luthi said. The problem was the emissions released by its combustion “So how do you burn coal and not release CO2?”

Luthi spoke with lawmakers regulators and energy companies and the result was House Bill 200. The law required the state’s utilities to generate a portion of their power from coal plants fitted with carbon capture equipment and directed state regulators to come up with the details. The final rules direct utilities to submit plans for producing at least 20 percent of their power with coal plants fitted with carbon capture technology by 2030 unless the companies can demonstrate that doing so is not feasible.

“This is the Wyoming climate change plan essentially” said Shannon Anderson staff attorney at the Powder River Basin Resource Council a Wyoming environmental group. She said the law has put the state in a bind and may force costs onto its residents and businesses in the form of higher electric bills.

Zwonitzer the bill’s sponsor said the state had no choice.

“We’ve gotten so Republican that even mentioning a tax increase will get you thrown out of office” said Zwonitzer who is a Republican. “There are no other revenue sources really outside of taxation on either our people or our minerals. So we’re currently trying to figure out how to keep taxing our minerals.”

While carbon capture has not yet worked commercially Zwonitzer said maybe it could if the state forced utilities to adopt it. “It’s almost mandatory for us to find a way to do this” he said.

Not Feasible ‘At This Time’

When the law passed in 2020 the potential impact on residents or utilities was speculative. The March filings made them real.

Black Hills Energy said that building carbon capture operations on two of its coal units would cost about $506 million and $474 million respectively. The second figure represents three times what it cost to build one of the coal generation units in the first place the filing said. If the costs were borne by ratepayers that would mean an increase of as much as 16 percent or $25 per month for the average residential customer. The operations would also siphon off more than a third of the units’ electrical output Black Hills said so it would have to build additional generation or have customers reduce their consumption.

Black Hills also said the carbon capture operations “may have an impact on ambient air quality in the area” because they have the potential to increase the emissions of certain pollutants. The increased demand for water “would apply stress on existing aquifers in the area” the company wrote.

Rocky Mountain Power the other utility said in the filing “There is not a portfolio standard that is economically feasible at this time.”

Both Black Hills and Rocky Mountain Power determined that the best carbon capture technology was a version that used an “amine-based solvent.” As they break down these solvents can form toxic carcinogens according to the Environmental Defense Fund. Last month the advocacy group submitted comments to the White House Council on Environmental Quality warning that the release of these chemicals “may pose serious hazards to workers and the public near capture facilities” but that the risks were not well understood.

“A lot of folks think about carbon capture as a way to address the environmental impacts of the coal industry but honestly what these filings show is that it just creates environmental problems” Anderson said.

However Michael Nasi a partner at the Texas law firm Jackson Walker who has represented coal and utility interests said the filings by Rocky Mountain Power and Black Hills failed to recognize the economic potential for carbon capture operations.

Nasi was among those who Luthi consulted when drafting the 2020 bill. He is a strong advocate for carbon capture and he represented NRG Energy when it built the nation’s only commercial-scale carbon capture operation at a U.S. coal plant outside Houston. The operation called Petra Nova ran for about three years before it ceased capturing carbon dioxide in 2020.

In Wyoming Nasi has been representing a small energy company called Glenrock Energy that has been trying to build a carbon capture project at one of Rocky Mountain Power’s coal plants. Glenrock wants to use the captured carbon dioxide to squeeze oil out of a nearby depleted petroleum reservoir through a practice called “enhanced oil recovery.”

“They don’t see it for what it really is” Nasi said of the utilities. “It’s very similar to basically a large industrial customer that instead of building widgets makes carbon and that carbon can be sold into the oil market with a bunch of very thirsty enhanced oil recovery projects that can use the CO2.”

Glenrock would pay for the carbon capture equipment Nasi said using its own financing. Ratepayers would not have to cover the costs. This is the model that Petra Nova used.

“Petra Nova was an oil project that had a very successful CCS demonstration built within it” Nasi said.

That dependence on oil brought its own risks however. It was the pandemic crash in oil prices NRG said that prompted it to halt operations in 2020. The carbon capture project has not restarted.

Nasi suggested a number of changes to the Wyoming legislation that remained in the final version according to emails provided to Inside Climate News by the Energy and Policy Institute a nonprofit watchdog group. The changes accelerated the timeline for when utilities would have to install carbon capture equipment moving the date to 2030 from 2040 and requiring the public service commission to come up with interim targets.

Nasi told Inside Climate News that the changes provided “adequate urgency” by forcing the utilities to move faster.

Black Hills declined to comment on the filings because they are part of an open docket with the public service commission.

PacifiCorp spokesman David Eskelsen said the company has not considered carbon capture to be viable in its own planning “due to the high capital cost.”

Still both companies said in the filings that they would continue to pursue installing carbon capture equipment at their plants as directed by state law. Black Hills said it would seek federal funding from the Energy Department. Rocky Mountain Power asked regulators to approve a $3.1 million annual surcharge on customers to fund the ongoing study.

‘A Huge Burden to Bear’

Many independent experts have already arrived at the conclusion that the prospects for coal with carbon capture in the U.S. power sector are dim. John Thompson technology and markets director of the environmental organization Clean Air Task Force doesn’t disagree but he said he thinks the technology holds great promise in Asia and that Wyoming could serve as a test case. Thompson’s group is one of a few environmental nonprofits advocating for federal spending on carbon capture for this reason.

Thompson pointed to data from the International Energy Agency showing that as of 2020 the majority of China’s coal emissions came from plants that were less than 10 years old. China’s coal emissions are greater than all the greenhouse gas emissions produced in the United States and they hit their highest level last year.

“I just don’t see how we solve the climate problem without carbon capture on coal” Thompson said. “And if we don’t solve it in China it’s game over on climate it really is.”

Thompson said fitting carbon capture technology onto Wyoming coal plants could help demonstrate a technology that could be deployed on a vast scale in China and other parts of Asia. But he said he’d want to see some changes to what the utilities are considering. He noted that the filings consider systems that would capture 90 percent of the emissions from the coal plants while that figure should be at least 95 percent. He also said they should pursue a different “dry-cooling” technology that would dramatically cut water use. Both changes would increase the costs of construction.

But Ian Lange an economist at the Colorado School of Mines who has served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers and studied carbon capture said he is skeptical that the economics will be much different in Asia. In the United States and Europe he said governments and utilities have spent years and billions of dollars trying to make the economic model work and “it basically didn’t.”

Wyoming will be the latest trial. The state law included provisions that give the utilities options to delay or possibly avoid installing carbon capture equipment as long as they can convince regulators that doing so would not be feasible.

Anderson with the Powder River Basin Resource Council said the public service commission should step in now to halt the process and prevent the utilities from raising rates for further study.

“Wyoming legislators made a policy choice to do something that none of the other states have done probably would never do and Wyoming customers have to bear the costs” she said. “It’s a huge burden to bear.”

Zwonitzer the bill’s sponsor insisted that any costs would be manageable. He said the state now has to wait for regulators to respond to the filings before determining what comes next. But he said Wyoming has little choice but to continue pursuing carbon capture technology.

“Am I gung-ho about it still? No. But do I think we have a couple of years to keep pushing the envelope and see where we end up? Yes” he said. “I think one day we’re going to wake up in Wyoming and coal will be gone and our economy will be devastated. So it’s my hope that my state and our consumers are OK with paying.”

Wyoming residents are just beginning to get a sense of what that might cost.

The National Weather Service is calling for temperatures next week in the mid-80’s to 90s and PJM the independent regional transmission organization that manages the electric grid in 13 states has notified Appalachian Power it may need to increase power generation at its hydroelectric plants to maintain the reliability of the regional electric grid.

“If the company is notified to increase power generation we have little time to alert the public” said George Porter who oversees communications for Appalachian Power’s hydro-operations. “Because of the short notice we want to make the public aware now of the possibility water levels could increase suddenly and continue to fluctuate throughout the week.”

Below Claytor Dam water levels could increase up to two feet in a matter of minutes. Water levels below Leesville Dam could increase as much as eight feet over a seven-hour period. Those considering recreating on the rivers should monitor AEP’s website for additional information.

Located on the New River in Pulaski County the Claytor Dam is operated by Appalachian Power. The total installed electric generating capacity of the plant is 76 megawatts. Leesville Dam with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts is part of the Smith Mountain Project a 636-megawatt pumped storage hydroelectric facility on the Roanoke River.

Electricity is simply more expensive these days.

But AES Ohio’s planned increase appears to be dramatic. The current AES Ohio “standard offer” price is 4.805 cents per kWh (kilowatt-hour). Starting June 1 the price will be 10.91 cents. That’s a monthly increase of more than $60 if you’re using 1000 kWh a month.

That will be the price paid by AES Ohio customers who have not chosen an alternative supplier or who aren’t in a community aggregation program.

A kilowatt-hour is how much energy you need to run a 1000-watt appliance for an hour. A 100-watt bulb takes 10 hours to use a kilowatt-hour of energy. A 2000-watt appliance takes 30 minutes.

American Electric Power in Columbus is set increase its rate by about 2 cents per kWh the Columbus Dispatch reported. Duke Energy and FirstEnergy are also looking at increases.

Bossart acknowledges that alternative rates “may not be as low as they have been in the past just due to the market. But there are some competitive rates out there.”

If you’re comparing prices you’re not alone.

Kettering City Councilman Bruce Duke said city leaders are starting to explore joining an electricity aggregation program to set lower rates for residents.

“Citizens are calling council people and saying ‘Hey look what are we doing about this?’” Duke said. “We see Dayton has done it Beavercreek has done it why can’t we do it?”

City Manager Mark Schwieterman agreed that Kettering is hearing questions. The city is only starting to examine its options beginning talks with the Miami Valley Communications Council which has eight member cities. Schwieterman said he also has met with representatives of the Sustainable Ohio Public Energy Council.

Last year Dayton joined that council a nonprofit group of governments that works to secure fixed-term electric rates.

In March this year in AES Ohio service territory competitive suppliers served 234789 customers who shopping around for service according to PUCO customer counts. In the same month 299821 customers were served by AES Ohio’s standard service offer.

Prices rise in June

Mary Ann Kabel a spokeswoman for AES Ohio emphasized that the higher standard service prices will be in effect for just one year. And she said the company has no control over the price that resulted from this year’s energy auction.

Local electric utilities like AES Ohio hold auctions to provide the electricity needed to serve retail customers typically residents and small businesses who have not switched to another retail provider. Wholesale suppliers who bid the lowest prices win the auctions.

This year’s auction yielded the new higher rate.

Kabel said as well that AES Ohio has the lowest rates in the state with regard to delivery charges bringing electricity to homes via poles wires and other infrastructure. (She referred customers to a company web site on the issue https://www.aes-ohio.com/comparing-energy-prices.)

AES Ohio offers customers what it calls “budget billing.” The company calculates bill amounts based on a household’s usage history. The household is billed the same amount each month. In August customers settle up with either a credit or balance due.

“We are working diligently to continue identifying and implementing ways to keep energy reasonable” Kabel said.

In response to questions from the Dayton Daily News the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel said it has found that in the aggregate consumers generally save money by enrolling in the utilities’ standard offers as compared to enrolling with energy marketers.

‘Do your homework’

When shopping you’ll want to compare alternative supplier offers with the “Price to Compare” shown on your electric bill.

Bossart advises people to know some basics before shopping. Who is your electricity supplier and what is your “price to compare?” The easiest way to do that is to have your bill handy she said.

She points to language on the AES Ohio customer bill that says: “In order for you to save money off of your utility’s supply charges a supplier must offer you a price lower than AES Ohio’s price of 4.8 cents per kWh for the same usage that appears on this bill.”

In June that price rises from 4.8 cents to 10.9 cents per kWh.

Armed with that information go to the energychoice.ohio.gov web site (sometimes called the “apples to apples” web site) Bossart said.

She points first-time visitors to the “frequently asked questions” section at the top right. Then go to “compare offers” at the top of the site’s front page. Click on “compare electric offers.”

Next if you’re a residential customer bring down the menu on “residential” at the top. AES Ohio customers looking to shop around can click on “AES Ohio.”

Scroll down to see a chart with available offers from an array of suppliers as well as contact information for those companies including phone numbers.

The first number you might want to see is easy to spot. Looking at the chart notice that in the column next to listed suppliers are kilowatt-per-hour rates.

Following that is the rate type (fixed or variable) and information on whether there’s an introductory rate length of contract and other variables.

If you want to narrow down your options click on a number of companies then hit “click to compare” at the top which should put that shorter list of suppliers in a new window.

Questions to ask

When switching Bossart says consumers should be aware of introductory rates which are followed by higher rates. They should also look for termination fees.

PUCO offers shoppers a list of questions they should ask new suppliers.

Two of the first questions to ask new suppliers: Is your price fixed or does it change? Does an introductory rate rise later on?

“Consumers should beware of short-term ‘teaser’ rates offered by marketers” the Consumers’ Counsel’s office said. “Teaser rates may at first look good but can be subject to later significant price increases.”

“Do your homework” Bossart said.

To sign up call a new supplier at the phone number provided on the chart. Be sure to read and understand any new contract. Your new supplier will contact your current supplier.

Add the Defense Innovation Unit to a growing list of U.S. government organizations furthering their work in nuclear power in pace.

The organization which seeks to get the military ready to use emergent commercial products announced two prototype contracts on May 17 ""to demonstrate the next generation of nuclear propulsion and power capability for spacecraft."" The ultimate aim is an orbital flight demonstration in 2027 DIU officials said in a statement.

The contracts went to two companies Ultra Safe Nuclear and Avalanche Energy to demonstrate nuclear propulsion and power capabilities for small spacecraft that would operate in cislunar (Earth-moon) space. (The values of the contracts were not disclosed in the release.)

It's part of the U.S. military's pressing focus on cislunar activities to keep an eye on commercial and government activities that will ramp up there in the coming decades including the international NASA-led Artemis program that seeks to put people on the moon in the 2020s.

If all goes to plan Ultra Safe Nuclear will demonstrate EmberCore a chargeable nuclear radioisotope battery useful for propulsion and power.

""This 'next-gen' radioisotope system will be able to scale to 10 times higher power levels compared to plutonium systems and provide more than 1 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of energy in just a few kilograms of fuel"" DIU stated.

Avalanche Energy's Orbitron seeks to trap fusion ions in electrostatic fields with assistance from a magnetron to keep the electrons closer to their nuclei (atom cores) than what is usually possible.

""The resulting fusion burn then produces the energetic particles that generate either heat or electricity which can power a high-efficiency propulsion system"" DIU stated. ""Compared to other fusion concepts Orbitron devices are promising for space applications as they may be scaled down in size and enable their use as both a propulsion and power source. ""

Another military organization seeking cislunar nuclear technology is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). On May 4 the organization announced it is ready to move forward on a project to design develop and assemble a nuclear thermal rocket engine for an expected flight demonstration in Earth orbit by 2026.

The proposals will support DARPA's Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) program which aims to develop a nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) system for use in Earth-moon space.

NTP uses fission reactors to heat hydrogen or other propellants and shoot them out of nozzles for thrust generating a thrust-to-weight ratio 10000 times higher than electric propulsion systems. It also improves upon chemical rockets as the propulsion efficiency (specific impulse) of NTPs is about two to five times higher DARPA officials wrote in a description of the DRACO program.

NASA is looking into NTPs as well. Such systems could bring astronauts to Mars in half the time than current propulsion systems (which would take six to nine months). NASA's fiscal 2023 budget request not yet approved by Congress includes $15 million to support nuclear propulsion and NASA is collaborating in the DRACO project too.

Now that Qatar Airways has joined the Avios loyalty program with British Airways there's never been an easier way to book Qsuites to aspirational destinations such as the Maldives. Let's take a look at how to do it.

Why it's special

Qsuite. (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Qsuites are a bucket list item on the list of many points and miles collectors. Qatar Airways operates its Qsuites to lots of fun routes around the world like Cape Town Bangkok Tokyo and Paris.

Perhaps the most enticing Qsuites destination is the Maldives. It's an award traveler's paradise with jaw-dropping five-star resorts in every direction — many of which can be reserved for free if you've got the right points.

There are two common ways to book Qsuites to the Maldives:

Via the British Airways site for 105000 Avios points each way

Via the American Airlines site for 70000 miles each way

But the sweetest spot of all is now with Qatar Airways Avios. You can fly from the U.S. to the Maldives in lie-flat Qsuites for 85000 points each way. The cash price for these flights depends on your route but never expect to pay less than $6000 round-trip for your ticket. And one-way flights can sometimes cost more than a round-trip. Expect to get a value of at least 3.5 cents per point for your Qatar Avios — a full 2 cents higher than TPG's valuation of Avios at 1.5 cents each.

The reason we consider this a better deal than the 70000-mile American Airlines option is because Qatar Avios are exponentially easier to earn. There are only a handful of ways to quickly earn American Airlines miles — but there are dozens of ways to quickly earn Qatar Airways Avios (as we'll cover below).

How to book this award

Step 1. Log into your Qatar Airways account

You'll have to sign into your Qatar Airways account to search for available award flights. Might as well get it out of the way immediately.

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Step 2. Click on ""Spend your Avios""

From the navigation bar at the top click the ""Privilege Club"" tab. You'll see a ""Spend"" category to the far right of the page. Click ""Spend your Avios.""

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Step 3. Click ""Book Now""

You're now taken to a page that lists all the ways you can spend your Qatar Avios. The first option is ""Book award flights."" That's the one you want.

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Step 4. Enter your travel details

On this page you can choose whether you want to book flights on Qatar Airways or its partner airlines. If you're after Qsuites stay on the ""Redeem on Qatar Airways/British Airways"" tab.

Qatar flies its Qsuites to a handful of U.S. cities including:

Atlanta

Boston

Chicago

Dallas

Houston

Los Angeles

Miami

New York

Philadelphia

San Francisco

Washington D.C.

Choose one of these airports. If there's no availability for your desired dates choose the next most convenient. In my opinion it's worth flying to another U.S. airport to catch a flight in Qsuites to your destination.

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Step 5. Find seats that aren't ""Flexi awards""

On the results page you'll see some awards with a ""Q2"" flag next to them (representing Flexi awards) and some without. The awards without the Flexi awards flag cost 85000 Avios in total to reach the Maldives in Qsuites. The awards with the flag cost 170000 Avios — double the price.

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Step 6. Choose your seats and book them

You can consult our ultimate guide to Qatar Qsuites to see which flights offer Qsuites. Just note that Qatar can swap aircraft at will so even if you've done everything right you may not get a Qsuite.

Per our ultimate guide flight QR 756 from Atlanta to Doha and flight QR 672 from Doha to Male are theoretically Qsuites. You should be able to tell if your flight is a Qsuite when selecting your seats. Or you can check ExpertFlyer (owned by TPG's parent company Red Ventures) to preview seat maps before you purchase.

As long as you select flights without the Q2 flag your award price should be 85000 one-way — and often around $200 in taxes and fees.

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Spending $200 in taxes isn't ideal. But for a flight that otherwise costs $6000+ it's a nominal fee.

How to earn points for this award

There are loads of ways to earn Qatar Airways Avios. That's because you can transfer British Airways Avios to Qatar at a 1:1 ratio — and British Airways Avios are perhaps the easiest points to earn in all of award travel.

As an example you can transfer the following flexible points currencies to British Airways and to Qatar from there:

Likewise Citi ThankYou points transfer directly to Qatar at a 1:1 transfer ratio making it the most direct transfer partner.

You've got many many cards to choose from that earn these types of points such as:

Bottom line

You can fly from the U.S. to the Maldives in arguably the best business class seat in the world — Qatar Qsuites — for just 85000 Qatar Airways Avios each way. You'll likely have to pay a couple of hundred dollars in taxes and fees but it's well worth the fee for a flight that would otherwise cost many thousands of dollars.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi9maWxtL25ld3MvYm8taG9wa2lucy1kZWFkLWFtZXJpY2FuLWdyYWZmaXRpLXRoZS13aWxkLWJ1bmNoLTEyMzUyODA2NjAv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIyL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy9iby1ob3BraW5zLWRlYWQtYW1lcmljYW4tZ3JhZmZpdGktdGhlLXdpbGQtYnVuY2gtMTIzNTI4MDY2MC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bo Hopkins Actor in ‘American Graffiti’ and Sam Peckinpah Classics Dies at 80,"Bo Hopkins the actor who has appeared in classics like “American Graffiti” “The Wild Bunch” “Midnight Express” and “The Getaway” died Friday. He was 80 years old.

Hopkins’ death was confirmed on the actor’s official website.

“It is with great sadness that we announce that Bo has passed away” reads a statement on the website. “Bo loved hearing from his fans from around the world and although he was unable to respond to every email over the last few years he appreciated hearing from each and every one of you.”

The actor was born William Hopkins in Greenville S.C. on February 2 1942.. He later changed his name to “Bo” in reference to the character he played in “Bus Stop” his first off-Broadway play. After his father died when he was only nine years old Hopkins was raised by his mother and grandmother. He later learned he was an adopted child and went on to meet his birth parents.

He joined the U.S. Army at the age of 16. After his service in the military he decided to pursue a career in acting and gained experience in summer stock productions and guest spots in several TV episodes.

Popular on Variety

Well known for playing key supporting roles in a number of major studio films between 1969 and 1979 Hopkins got his start in feature films as “Crazy Lee” in the iconic 1969 western “The Wild Bunch.” He was subsequently hired by director Sam Peckinpah for another supporting turn as a bank robber in “The Getaway” (1972). Hopkins later starred in dozens of feature films such as “White Lightning” (1973) “Posse” (1975) “The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing” (1973) “Midnight Express” (1978) “American Graffiti” (1973) and “The Bounty Hunter” (1989).

Transcript

Stefan Bradley:

Good people good people welcome to Amherst College. The weather outside is frightful but the spirit inside is delightful. You all are very fortunate today to have the opportunity to speak with these fine gentlemen. But more than that you are fortunate to have the opportunity to hang out with these future leaders the class of 2022 congratulations to them. Everybody round of applause. I happen to know a couple of the class of 2022 and some are in here now. And we won't talk about what we needed to do to get you through. So I'm just playing with you. Another round of applause for the parents friends and family who did get these young people through really.

Stefan Bradley:

My name is Stefan Bradley. I am a professor in the department of Black studies and history and it is my pleasure to be here with you today. And I have the opportunity to introduce these very influential and important role models. Now at each Amherst commencement the college awards honorary doctoral degrees to special invitees in recognition of their outstanding contributions in their field of expertise. The individuals chosen for this recognition are selected not only for their extraordinary contributions in their respective fields but also and I want you to hear this particularly class of 2022 but also because we believe that the arc of their career their vision and their commitment to excellence are inspirational for our students own aspirations to make meaningful contributions to society. What that means is they did well but they're also doing good. I hope you follow me on that.

Stefan Bradley:

So we are grateful to our honored guests for generously giving public talks during commencement weekends so that we all can hear from them directly. Now your questions will be welcomed as soon as we finish this conversation. What we'll do is we'll form a single file line at that microphone there. And we ask those of you wishing to ask a question to remain seated until after we finish this conversation here. Our wonderful Stephanie Ramirez from the communications department is on site and here to help if you need it at all and you can get her attention by raising your hand. So without any further ado let me tell you about a man that I first became acquainted with on the coffee table of my parents' home where there was Ebony and Jet magazine. And in Ebony and Jet magazine I found a handsome man by the name of Mr. Ken Chenault who is now the chairman and managing director of the venture capital firm General Catalyst.

Stefan Bradley:

Now this is where we knew him from prior to joining general catalyst Mr. Chenault was chairman and chief executive officer of American Express a position that he held from 2001 to 2018. Now upon retirement from American Express Warren Buffet maybe you've heard of him Warren Buffet the company's largest shareholder stated Ken's been the gold standard. Listen to me the gold standard for corporate leadership and the benchmark that I measure others against. At General Catalyst Mr. Chenault focuses on investing in fast growing companies that have the potential to become large fundamental institutions. He also provides invaluable guidance to portfolio companies particularly those with an eye towards global markets and responsible innovation particularly as they scale their teams and products. Now Mr. Chenault is recognized as one of the business world's experts on brands and brand management.

Stefan Bradley:

He has been honored by multiple publications including Fortune magazine which named him as one of the world's 50 greatest leaders in its inaugural list in 2014 and again in 2021. Time magazine celebrated Mr. Chenault together with Ken Frazier his partner and a venture in the time 100 Most Influential People of 2021 list for their corporate and social activism. Specifically and I love this specifically for mobilizing hundreds of corporate leaders to advocate for equitable voting rights in the United States. We need that now. Equitable voting rights in the United States and for co-founding OneTen a coalition of leading executives coming together to upscale higher boy this is fantastic. Upscale higher and advance 1 million Black Americans over the next 10 years into family-sustaining jobs with opportunities for advancement.

Stefan Bradley:

Mr. Chenault serves on the boards of Airbnb Berkshire Hathaway Chief Guild Education and the Harvard Corporation. He also serves on the boards of numerous nonprofit organizations including the Smithsonian Institution Advisory Council. And I love this for the National Museum of African American History and Culture. In conversation with Mr. Chenault today will be our own...

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

After that one just don't read mine. Just go sit down. Brother come on.

Stefan Bradley:

We don't take any slouches at Amherst College. And so I won't introduce a slouch to you. I'll introduce one of the best that we have the right Reverend Phillip A. Jackson who is a 1985 alumnus of Amherst College and a trustee of the college. I have had the opportunity to serve with the Reverend Jackson and he is cool as the other side of the pillow. All right.

Stefan Bradley:

Reverend Jackson was named 19th Rector of Trinity Church Wall Street in Manhattan in February of 2022 after serving as priest-in-charge and vicar. Before arriving at Trinity in 2015 the Reverend Jackson was director of Christ Church of the Ascension in Paradise Valley Arizona. He has also served parishes in Houston and Detroit. And before being ordained as a priest imagine this he practiced law as a litigator in Hawaii. Reverend Jackson earned his B.A. of course he did his B.A. at Amherst College in history. Thank you. And subsequently earned a J.D. from Yale Law School and an M.Div. from The Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley California. Please join me in welcoming Mr. Ken Chenault in conversation with the Reverend Phil Jackson.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

Thank you brother. Ken thank you for coming and being part of this. We love having you here. We love being able to honor you even though you went to Bowdoin. But we're good with that. We're good with it.

Ken Chenault:

I can attone a little bit. Let me first say this.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

Oh I think they need you to turn that.

Ken Chenault:

I'm going to turn my mic on. Let me first say that I'm delighted to be at Bowdoin. Oh Amherst. Yeah no I'm thrilled to be here and I should tell you that Stefan thank you very much for that warm introduction. I was delighted that Stefan did it because my brother's name is Stefan and he was Amherst class of 1974.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

Hey.

Ken Chenault:

He would be here but he's in Spain and he said ""I'm going to stay in Spain."" But it is great to be here. And then I would also just tell you that Biddy Martin I just think is an incredible leader. And I've just been so grateful for the opportunity to work with her as a fellow at the Harvard Corporation. So it's great. Thank you Biddy.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

Yes indeed. So Ken what I thought we'd do is your business acumen is legendary. But I thought what I'd like to do anyway is sort of help us get to know you a little bit.

Ken Chenault:

Sure.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

What was your family like and where were you from? Were you born? And...

Ken Chenault:

Yeah so I grew up in Hempstead Long Island which I describe as the middle of the fish. And Hempstead is sort of a working-class town. And it's a town that I think in many respects was a microcosm of what was happening in the United States. It used to be probably 70% White and maybe 15% Black. And then in the fifties and sixties shifted dramatically to probably around 70% 75% Black 25% White. But it was a good place to grow up. And I was fortunate that I had two incredible loving parents. My father was a dentist and he was absolutely brilliant. And one of the things he talked to me about was what he called the widening of your aperture. When he grew up when he was 10 years old he lived in a small town Mount Healthy Ohio outside of Cincinnati went into Cincinnati.

Ken Chenault:

And he came across this Black man who he thought was really dressed very properly. And he followed him and he went into a church. It was a Sunday. And he introduced himself to this person who was just so entranced and this person was a dentist. So my father said ""That's what I'm going to be."" This was in the '20s. And he said ""This is someone that I can look up to."" And so one of the things I think that was important is both on my mother's side of the family the history there was she grew up in Anderson South Carolina and she came from actually a very educated family. So on her lineage side on her family side there were the quicks and the blendings. And the blendings really were doctors and lawyers. And actually we have a descendant that in Reconstruction Thomas E. Miller served for nine months as a U.S. Congressman.

Ken Chenault:

But she also had a challenging part of her childhood that her family both parents were college educated. They went to HBCUs and her father had the job as the postal clerk in Anderson South Carolina which was highly unusual for a Black person to have that job. And family law we don't have the proof but I'm actually going through the legal records in it seems to be the case. He was arrested for mail fraud after serving for 20 years in the post office. And what happened was in his coat pocket hanging in someone supposedly or either he did put a $5 bill in his pocket and he went to jail for two and a half years. And so the family left South Carolina went to Brooklyn. And you could imagine a large family and all the children except for one ended up going to college. But I think for both my parents education was absolutely critical. Had a sister two brothers.

Ken Chenault:

And what was also important is there was this view of service that you needed to be in service to people. And we were also brought up with a great deal of racial pride. And I grew up I talk about this that I grew up and was born three years before Brown v. Board of Education. How different would my life have been? It's the accident of birth. And the accident of birth that I was born into a family that really valued education. But growing up I love sports. I loved reading but I was an incredibly undisciplined student until pretty much my senior year of high school. And it was really frustrating for my parents. I tested well but I stood... I actually read a lot but I read what I wanted to read not necessarily what I was assigned. And so for me I was fascinated by the civil rights movement.

Ken Chenault:

And that's what I wanted to be. I wanted to be a civil rights leader. I wanted to be on the front lines. I had zero interest in business. I didn't know much about it. And it certainly didn't seem very interesting to me. ""Why would someone want to go into business?"" So I then went to Springfield College freshman year. I really woke up as a student and I did really well but what we also did is the Black students took over a building and I was part of that. And so we took over a dormitory building. I was suspended for probably a week or two.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

What year would that have been?

Ken Chenault:

Huh?

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

What year would that have been?

Ken Chenault:

That would've been 1970.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

Okay.

Ken Chenault:

1970. So that was the midst of a lot of turmoil that was going on. And I remember my parents coming up visiting us with because there actually was a trial. And so that was an intense experience. But I had a headmaster of the school I went to his name was Peter Kern who was just a terrific person. Also was someone I really respected a great deal. He drove up and said ""You finally have become serious as a student. You should think about Bowdoin. And you're also someone who still needs some isolation"" Which is absolutely right.

Ken Chenault:

Because If I'd been in a place like Boston it just wouldn't worked for me. I said I'd gotten somewhat disciplined but I wasn't that disciplined. And those were formative experiences for me. And I loved Bowdoin. I took every single history course offered. I took economics. I took chemistry which I didn't do particularly well in but I wanted to learn. And Bowdoin was ideal for me. I played soccer and I ran track. I think we beat Amherst once in my time there but we won. So that was good. The football team certainly didn't beat Amherst but it was good.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

He's going to come here to our house talking okay. Okay. What was it about the liberal arts that got you?

Ken Chenault:

I think what's really important. I think liberal arts is more important than ever because I really believe one of my mentors had a phrase that you should always operate on the margin of your ignorance. And I think what's incredible liberal arts is the opportunity really to learn about a range of subjects. And you can't really learn how to think unless you know a lot about the world knowledge. Knowledge is important. And what I also like about the liberal arts is studying it to me is selfless. I mean you're not learning because you're saying ""If I learn this aspect of liberal arts this is going to enable me to achieve this material success."" It's the pursuit of knowledge the ultimate pursuit of knowledge-

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

For its own sake.

Ken Chenault:

For its own sake. And I think that's very important.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

So how'd you end up... By the way I should say my father was a dentist too in Chicago.

Ken Chenault:

That's great.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

Yeah. And my parents had the exact same drive for education that you described.

Ken Chenault:

Great. That's terrific. So how did you then end up in business?

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

So it was a circuitous route. I like to say what's... I think has been very consistent in my life is serendipity. But then being ready for that opportunity. And I went to law school right after Bowdoin and I went there because I thought it would be useful to understand the law. I thought maybe I would be a litigator again thinking of the civil rights movement. And I enjoyed law school and I enjoyed it I guess for two or three reasons. One is particularly I think whether it was Harvard Law School or Yale Law School or Columbia but the opportunity really to deal with people with first rate minds. I found very very exciting. And I also found the pursuit of law and understanding the impact it can have on the broader society was also very impactful to me.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

But I went to a law firm large law firm. I thought that'd be useful to do but it wasn't particularly thoughtful of this is the step the next step. And I was there for two and a half years and a friend of mine was at Bannon company and talked to me about strategic consulting which I didn't know anything about. And Bain was actually at that time it's a very large firm now but was based in Boston they hadn't expanded yet. And they were maybe four or five years in existence. So even though I wouldn't have characterized it at the time it was like a startup that people were energetic. They were really bright. And so I went up for the interview and again the serendipity is that Bain decided that they would experiment by hiring two or three lawyers and two or three medical doctors and train them to be consultants.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

With the idea that you would be bringing some way of looking at [inaudible 00:21:17]-

Ken Chenault:

Some way of some different perspectives which I think was...

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

Smart.

Ken Chenault:

Smart right? Different perspectives are critical. And we were sort of just thrown into the pool. I was handed some accounting textbooks ""Study those at night in the weekends. And we're going to put you on assignments right away."" And I was drinking from a fire hose. It was an incredible experience. And then similarly I didn't have... I would've stayed at Bain. And I got a call someone that Shirley Tilghman who's on the board here who knows very well. Louis Gerstner who's was a legendary CEO of IBM was running the largest division at American Express and was also responsible for a joint venture with Warner Cable.

Ken Chenault:

And so to date me Cable was in its early stages. And they were going to bring in two people to do strategic planning at a relatively low level. So it was not I was going to be a vice president. It was I was called director of strategic planning which sounded lofty. But at the end of the day it was lower middle management at best. But there were only three of us in the group. And it was an exciting time for the changes that were going on in financial services in payments. And what I really liked about American Express frankly was its history that had been around since 1850.

Ken Chenault:

Secondly I love the fact that American Express had an incredibly strong service ethic. So whatever business they were in American Express was known for service. And so that was something that was attracted to me. And then third I really was fascinated by Cable. And that was a key motivation for me. And I thought I would just come to American Express for a few years. In fact when Louis Gerstner interviewed me he said ""In Louis very warm way convince me why we should hire you."" And I went through those reasons but I said ""Louis look at the end of the day I'm not a lifer."" I'm not really someone who's going to be in a big company. If you know Louis that peaked his interest. And he said ""Well if you're any good I'll give you a recommendation for whatever you want to do in two or three years."" So I figured that was a good trade off.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

And so?

Ken Chenault:

So I went there and I would say people asked me for the first 10 years Kathy we always thought maybe two or three more years be there and then kept on building up probably around the 15th 16th year. Kathy said ""I think we're here for a while."" And really Phil what was fascinating to me is I had a front row seat and involvement in some of the most massive changes that occurred in financial services and payments. And what was really in important in my development is I really started to understand what it took to be an effective leader.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

And what are those things?

Ken Chenault:

So for me one is I'd start with my leadership mantra which I've taken from Napoleon and I caveat I don't want to wind up like him. But it is to me the most simple and powerful definition of leadership. The role of a leader is to define reality and give hope. And if you think about what it means to be a leader it is very hard. If you think about the times we're in to define reality that is a real challenge. But to be an effective leader it's not enough to define reality. What are the reasons why people should be hopeful? What's the case you're making? What are the strategies? What are the tactics? So I think first and foremost I think an effective leader I look for someone who has a very high level of integrity because fundamentally if you can't build trust you're not going to be an enduring leader which my view of business companies leaders it's all about enduring.

Ken Chenault:

There are a lot of people that can for two or three years or companies for five years or 10 years but how do you really have an enduring leader? How do you build an enduring company? And so it starts with integrity which for me is the consistency of words and actions. Because honesty I tell people is the minimum requirement. Most people are honest but I think we all have a challenge of having our actions be consistent with our words. And it's very difficult if you don't do that most of the time and none of us do it all the time to create the level of trust that you need. So that's the first thing is integrity. Second for me that I look for are really people who understand how to play within a team and people get that confused. They think if I'm a good teammate that means I'm a go to long person.

Ken Chenault:

No you're a lousy teammate. Because the best teammates really figure out a way to be supportive of everyone on the team. They will clearly and should tell you when you fall short but they're also there to help you. And the reality is that if you're a good teammate that makes an incredible difference. So I look for people who can do that. And I talk about it the best teammates engage in what I call constructive confrontation which is the other thing that I look for in a leader is transparency and the willingness back to confronting reality.

Ken Chenault:

Tell me what your perspectives are. Tell me what your views are. That constructive confrontation I say constructive because it always should be done with respect but be unsparing in your criticism but also be generous in your praise. So that is what I think from a teammate standpoint. Next trade I look for is I look for courage. And the way you see things will keep on coming back to facing reality and giving hope is when you're a leader is do you have the willingness to make the tough calls even though it may put you personally in a very difficult situation? And I always believe from a leadership standpoint you've got to have the recognition that it's lonely. And we all want support but it's courageous to stand alone. And there are times from a leadership standpoint that you have to do that.

Ken Chenault:

And then I look for people who are both decisive and compassionate. Because ultimately for a leader you want to win the hearts and minds. And you're not going to win the minds if you're not decisive. And you're not going to win the hearts if you're not compassionate if you don't show people that you care. And the best leaders to me are decisive doesn't mean that they're always the most popular but it does mean I want people who will be compassionate. And in a business context sometimes people would say to me ""Well Ken does that mean you can't really be tough?"" At the end of the day again I'm interested in being an enduring leader and I will make the tough calls but I think that we're humans and compassion is important. And then the last attribute is people who are adaptable because the world is changing and you can't just if you stand still you fall back.

Ken Chenault:

And I think Darwin had it right? It's not the strongest species or... Not the strongest species or the most intelligent it's the ones that are most adaptive to change. And I think that adaptability but that adaptability comes with a set of core values. And one of the things I always ask people and particularly when I'm interviewing people is what are your core values and beliefs? And one of the things I would say to the graduates is you'll have a major advantage in life if you're reflective about what you stand for. And in the times we're in you need to really think through what are my core values and what will I stand for? Because that to me having that center is core.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

I got to ask you what are your core values?

Ken Chenault:

I think I listed them. And I would say the last thing for me Phil which is important and I didn't crystallize it 'till around 20 years ago is fundamentally I want to make a meaningful difference in people's lives. That's what I want to do.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

So you two are going along. Oh sorry. We got five minutes. Oh I'm just getting started. Sorry. You two are going along. Two years becomes three becomes eight becomes 15 becomes 20. When did you start realizing that you were probably going to be CEO and Chairman?

Ken Chenault:

So I would say and you correct me Kathy. I don't think we didn't talk about it until maybe I became CEO when I was 50 I think 49. And we didn't start talking about it maybe 'till five years before. Because one of the thing is that... And everybody's different. I admire some people who can say ""This is what I'm going to do. And this is where I'm going to be 10 15 20 years from now."" That's great. For me it would be difficult for me to just operate because then I'd be wondering if am I chasing the goal of being CEO? And then what might I compromise.

Ken Chenault:

And I never wanted to put myself in that situation where I'd be overly careful. And I would say it was around five years before I was CEO. I had had people say things 10 years before I became CEO but I didn't really think about it a lot. And I think that was very helpful in my career. As I said everyone's different. Some people need... ""Boy this is what I'm going to do. This is I'm going to be focused on that."" For me I would've found it a little bit too restrictive.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

But it sounds like you're the kind of person who as you said earlier when the door opens you walk through with courage.

Ken Chenault:

Yeah. I think what I would say Phil is I... What energizes me the most where I'm most excited is taking an idea building that idea. And then to me what comes after I feel really good about. But the pure pursuit of the position is not what energizes me the most. Now let me be very clear. I very much enjoyed being CEO. And I was glad I was CEO but what has always been the most energizing to me is developing an idea executing against it helping lead people and developing people.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

Let me... We're going to go to Q&A in just a sec but you've referenced a couple of times the current world in the state of the world. Ken if I just ask you to sort of go up to your 50000 foot level what do you see right now? What's going on?

Ken Chenault:

Well I guess where I'm very concerned and is that we're in a world and certainly in the United States where facts and truth are being viewed by some as not that important. And people have said to me ""Look politicians have always lied through American history."" And I've said ""Absolutely."" But they were embarrassed. They didn't want to be caught. We're in an environment where people lie and they're cold on it. It's no big deal.

Ken Chenault:

That's a fundamental problem. And so I think that if I just take the United States I believe strongly in the ideals and values of our democracy. And I believe two of the core attributes that are being left out in the public discourse is character and civility. And I can deal with people with a range of political viewpoints. But I think what's critical is I'm not going to compromise on character. And when people tell me ""Well so and so has done good things politically. And so I'm going to totally excuse the core character."" That's an expedient short term position that really is going to hurt this country in a fundamental way. And I just think when you compromise on basic values that hurts any organization and it's hurting our country tremendously. So I have a major concern there. What I would also say and this is where the hope part for me is I'm seeing some individuals some organizations starting to say ""We're going to deal with some of society's intractable problems.""

Ken Chenault:

And one of the things that excites me of what I'm doing now whether it's healthcare or workforce development in both the profit sector and the non-profit sector is I'm seeing people really more mission driven. So in the same time I could despair about what's happening in the United States and obviously parts of the world. But fundamentally I believe people can make a real difference. And I'm hopeful but I am discouraged that more individuals are not standing up for character and you don't need a political party to do that. You can do it yourself. You can do it with a group. And I think unless we have that type of energy and commitment to core values I think we're in for a tough time. But the optimist in me says they're going to be some developments that will occur and individuals will coalesce. And that's what I'm going to be focused on. Not the despair. I'm going to be real about the challenge but I'm still going to try to make a difference.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

That's profound. Are we going to...

Stefan Bradley:

Here we go-

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

Stefan. Yeah.

Stefan Bradley:

Everybody round of applause. It's quite fortuitous. That brother Chenault sits underneath the picture of Charles Hamilton Houston the Amherst College alumnus who went on to Harvard Law and who went on to revive the Law School at Howard University where brother Chenault and Ms. Kathy most generously provided a fellowship in the name of Vernon Jordan here recently. And so they're still taking care of young people still looking out for people. So very important. And thank you for that endeavor. We have enough time for some questions and comments. I'm thinking maybe 10 15 minutes or so. If you have... We have rules. If you have comment may they be brief. But please let forth your questions. Yes yes. And there's a microphone over here. If you need assistance with the microphone coming to you please just raise your hand and we'll have somebody get it to you.

Speaker 4:

I think I'd get to be first. Thank you for being here.

Ken Chenault:

Thank you.

Speaker 4:

My question is you've done a lot of work in inclusion. You have been a civil rights leader. How would you advise executives such as myself in the federal government to build a more inclusive organization? Studies show that organizations that are diverse are more profitable more successful in all dimensions. What advice would you have for me and for others who may go into government service?

Ken Chenault:

So I think first what's important and I believe that again to make sure that you're doing something that's enduring you need to tie it in to the organization's mission and values. That's absolutely important. And so for me diversity was very critical to the values of our company and fortunately any institution that I'm involved in. But I think it's important that the leaders and leaders don't talk about diversity as a sideshow.

Ken Chenault:

So we're going to talk about the business. We're going to talk about what we need to do and we got to deal with this issue of diversity in the last five minutes. That has to be front and center on the agenda. Then I think it's important to then put the strategies and tactics in place. And I will tell you while it is a challenging issue some of the steps that need to be taken are not that difficult. And so part of what you've got to do is set some real goals and objectives. And in the business context I'll tell you one of the initiatives that I'm involved in and one of the trustees in Amherst who's also a good friend Dave McClenan Cargill has been a terrific partner.

Ken Chenault:

And Dave and I have had not just broad discussions but very specific tactical discussions about how do you increase the representation from a diversity standpoint particularly in a number of the technology functions? What do you do? So what are the targets that you set? What are the best practices that you've put in place? And the reality what I say to people in any business and organizational context can you imagine a situation where year after year you had people come in saying ""I worked really hard. I just focused on this issue but we've made no progress."" Year after year after year. You know what would happen? They'd be gone. You say ""Excuse me something is wrong.""

Ken Chenault:

And so I think you've got to focus on it like it's one of your top priorities for any organization. You need to set the objectives and you need to measure people against the achievement of those objectives. At American Express we set very specific goals and objectives for diversity. And we actually tied it in for our leadership group to their incentive compensation. People said ""How can you do that?"" Said ""What do you mean? It's a top priority."" We're not business priorities. And the reality is we got to make progress here. And we set representation goals and we set very clearly. No one argued that we didn't have a performance based culture. And back to enduring my successor Steve [inaudible 00:45:29] has continued. That push has been no led up at all because it was really institutionalized. The very processes and practices for improvements in diversity have been put into the organization.

Stefan Bradley:

Good. Thank you.

Charles Flippin:

I really appreciated your comments. I'm Charles Flippin and father of a graduate.

Ken Chenault:

Terrific.

Charles Flippin:

... Tomorrow. So very proud of that. Question. You talked a lot about character and how core that is. Do you think the business world has a role in sort of reawakening the issue of character in our political processes and discourse? And if so how?

Ken Chenault:

So I would say one of the points I would make is and I really do mean this. Some of my strongest relationships are with people in business and I think they are very value driven people. I think Dave is a very value driven person. And I think we have a number of colleagues that we feel the same way.

Ken Chenault:

However I think there has to be an understanding that corporations exist because society allows us to exist. And we have a responsibility to have a positive impact on society. And yes I think companies do need to not on every single issue. I don't think that's possible. But the reality is I think companies need to take a position on some issues. And so the reason why Ken Frazier and I were very focused on the voting rights issue is how more fundamental is it for our democracy to operate than the right to vote? And when people said ""Well I don't think you should be involved in politics."" We said ""It's not politics. This is about our democracy. This is nonpartisan."" But if companies can lobby for their business interests why can't they lobby for some basic fundamental societal interests? And again it's got to be aligned with the mission and values of the company. Then this comes to character.

Ken Chenault:

And I think what's important is and I've said this to several CEOs none of you would put someone on the board who you had fundamental doubts about their character. And so in our top leadership political leadership positions when you say ""Yeah I like the policies and he's a liar. He's not someone I can trust but I'll go along with it."" That's not a good situation. And so I'm not naive that we all make compromises against objectives but you got to start and say ""Here's some base objectives. Some base character traits that we need to have in our top leaders in the country."" So I think you have a situation where I think there are a number of leaders who in their company stress the values but I don't think you can then open the door to the outside world and say ""But the outside world's not as important and the top political leaders I'll give them a pass."" I just don't think that works in the long term. And so I do think that in asserting the values the issue is how do we practice those values?

Speaker 6:

Hi. Hi Kathy. Again I'm Aggie's daughter and I'm actually a question for Aggie [inaudible 00:49:54]-

Ken Chenault:

Aggie come in.

Speaker 6:

And your role-

Ken Chenault:

Aggie.

Speaker 6:

... Your role in the corporate world of course is legendary and your legacy. And I think also equally important for Aggie and for me but her question is really about what is maybe lesser known about your role in the art world and the impact and why you have prioritized for example the Studio Museum in Harlem and what the role is for the corporate world in the art world? And then my additional question would be what is the role for the arts in the corporate world? Because I think it speaks to the larger question of the role of arts in our democracy.

Ken Chenault:

That's great.

Speaker 6:

Thank you.

Ken Chenault:

Well thank you.

Stefan Bradley:

Before you answer brother. Thank you very much for the question. I would also before we leave here love to have a graduating senior potentially ask a question in our offer comment before we leave here. I'm looking at Joelle Critchlow. And so all right please tell us.

Ken Chenault:

So first let me say for people who do not know Agnes Gund is really one of the foremost collectors of art in our country and has done so much for artists in opening up opportunity. But what she's also done which is I think one of the most innovative actions is to use art to promote social justice and actually to have people and Kathy and I are very honored participants. But I really just want to thank you Agnes for your innovative approach and your ability to garner the followership that you've been able to achieve. So thank you. Let me also say that Kathy is far more conversant and is been far more of a leader in this space but she has amassed an incredible collection of African American art. And she has been a long term board member of the Studio Museum of Harlem which has been incredible in the development of African American artists Kehinde Wiley Lorna Simpson. I mean the list goes on and on of now world renowned artist who really got a tremendous push from the Studio Museum of Harlem.

Speaker 7:

[inaudible 00:52:46].

Ken Chenault:

Yeah.

Stefan Bradley:

And [inaudible 00:52:50] museum is what she said out loud.

Ken Chenault:

No well that's more historical but we do have some art in that museum. But really I want to... Kathy has really been the one I tell this story that her first painting that she purchased was by an African American artist named William Johnson who's just incredible. And we both did not have really any money at all-

Speaker 7:

Five years ago.

Ken Chenault:

It was a long time ago but she spent probably half of our combined income on that painting. It's done very well and we still have kept it.

Aaron:

Is that all right? I'm Aaron I'm a graduating senior.

Ken Chenault:

Congratulations.

Aaron:

Thank you. Thank you. I wanted to thank you so much for being here speaking to us. It's been fantastic. I have a question related to your current role.

Ken Chenault:

Yes.

Aaron:

Which is in thinking about venture capital or private equity more broadly. I think there's an argument to be made that when a company and its life cycle opens itself up to external capital it's kind of also opening itself up to external influence.

Ken Chenault:

Yes.

Aaron:

And in your role as partnering with founders but also being a provider of capital ultimately I'm wondering how you view your role in either maintaining the economic business social or political culture of the firm or being able to alter or refine that culture in ways that you think will be more successful for the company moving forward.

Ken Chenault:

Right. It's a great question. One of the things that was most important to me when I joined General Catalyst that I knew the two founders for over 20 years because in my role at American Express we were very much a technology enabled company. And I really got to know the startup ecosystem very well. And actually one of the payments companies which is probably now one of the most valuable companies that I invested in for AmEx was Stripe and which is doing incredibly well. But what was critical to me and one of the reasons why I joined is said technology is a great enabler but I don't see the level of responsibility by a number of companies in technology or a venture. And one of the things we talked about was that we wanted actually to create and build a firm that was not a social impact fund but was focused on this view that you could in fact invest in businesses that generate very good returns and you could also do good if you started off with some intentionality.

Ken Chenault:

So one of the things that we've developed is a philosophy that we call responsible innovation. And one of the tenets of that is understanding the unintended consequences for what you do. So if in fact you're a social media company what are some of the unintended consequences? And as a result of the progress in machine learning and AI we should be able to figure out a great deal of those unintended consequences not all of them but some of them. Second thing that we do with founders now is we really focus on what are the values of the founder right? If we're going to make the investment and we say we've actually changed our mission that we want to invest in powerful positive change that endures. And so that line endures is something that we feel very strongly about.

Ken Chenault:

And then with founders we want to help them be better leaders. And let's be very clear. We want to generate top decile returns but we also have an exacting standard of the values of the founder and really helping that founder understand what their broader areas of responsibilities should be. And for me what I've found really I've been involved in some of our investments in healthcare. And there are several companies for example and this gets to the hope part. It's a company that we invested in called Cityblock for profit company that's focused on the delivery of healthcare in low income neighborhoods. And they've created an economic and a technology model to do that. Another company that I'm very very involved in is a company called Guild Education that I think can play a role in helping to transform the workforce.

Ken Chenault:

And one of the things that I'm seeing when we get involved for example in FinTech we want to make sure we understand the customer that this product is going to help but who may or may not be negatively impacted? And so by no means are we perfect but I think that what I'm excited about and I would say we're probably most advanced in healthcare that I believe that we can really bring about some fundamental changes in the delivery of healthcare and in the costs of healthcare. And that would not have been possible without the advances in technology. So to me it's exciting. I love working frankly with young people. I love the passion of founders and I think we can make a real impact. And the other thing that's exciting to me is I'm now seeing an integration. So some of the nonprofit OneTen there are several of our portfolio companies that are able to work with them.

Ken Chenault:

I actually have them working with them at cost not for profit. But the positioning frankly and David and I went through this he's using one multiverse is said do it at cost. If you do a good job it's Dave's call whether he uses you further. And so there's nothing wrong. And let me be very clear. I believe in capitalism and I believe in democracy but I believe fundamentally particularly in venture which I think has not been focused enough on the responsibility. And so it shouldn't be you compromise on returns but you shouldn't compromise therefore on what you need to do to have a positive impact on society. You got to do both.

Stefan Bradley:

Thank you so much. We are over by a couple minutes right now but maybe we can do one more one more. All right.

Speaker 9:

All right. Father of a graduating senior tomorrow not a question a comment. I had the privilege of working for American Express for 10 years with Ken. And I just wanted to say that... Excuse me. Everything he talks about today is so true. He's a wonderful speaker but he's such a great leader. The commitment that you gave between your actions and your words the consistency as you talked about we would go into meetings. He would challenge us. He would disagree with us. He'd correct us. We would leave so motivated. There was a way that he did that and everything that you showed me at that point in my life really affected me as a leader. It's affected me as a parent. The ability to you know to be courageous and to disagree and to do it constructively those are lessons I never forgot. So it's amazing to hear you again Ken after many years to see you. Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for all your support from my family you changed our lives. Thank you.

Ken Chenault:

Thank you so much. Thank you Phil.

Reverend Phillip A. Jackson:

Yeah. Thank you.

Stefan Bradley:

Great thanks to the Reverend Phil Jackson and Mr. Ken Chenault. But before we leave I also wanted to recognize our boss who is making moves onward President Biddy Martin. Please a round of applause for her. You all go forth be dry and enjoy this weekend. Enjoy this weekend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9iby1ob3BraW5zLWRlYWQtd2lsZC1idW5jaC1hbWVyaWNhbi1ncmFmZml0aS0xMjM1MTU1ODU3L9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9iby1ob3BraW5zLWRlYWQtd2lsZC1idW5jaC1hbWVyaWNhbi1ncmFmZml0aS0xMjM1MTU1ODU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bo Hopkins ‘Wild Bunch’ and ‘American Graffiti’ Actor Dies at 84,"Bo Hopkins the wily actor with the wild-eyed gaze who came to fame portraying thieves and scoundrels in such films as The Wild Bunch American Graffiti Midnight Express and White Lightning died Saturday. He was 84.

Hopkins died at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys after suffering a heart attack on May 9 his wife of 33 years Sian told The Hollywood Reporter.

With his hair-trigger delivery Hopkins was a favorite of Sam Peckinpah who cast him in three features — as Clarence “Crazy” Lee in The Wild Bunch (1969) as a double-crossed bank robber in The Getaway (1972) and as a weapons expert in The Killer Elite (1975).

His turn as Joe Young the leader of the Pharaohs greaser gang in George Lucas‘ American Graffiti (1973) solidified him as a top-notch screen villain. The highlight of his role included coaxing Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) to attach a hook and chain to a police car so that when it gives chase the back axle flies off.

“I go to car shows because American Graffiti is the national anthem of car shows” Hopkins said in a 2012 interview with Shock Cinema magazine. “Graffiti got people out draggin’ and going up and down streets cruisin’. It got people into cars doing that kind of stuff again. If I told you how many times people have come up to Candy [Clark] Paul [Le Mat] and me at these shows and told us that we’ve changed their lives you wouldn’t believe it.”

As his career evolved the sandy-haired South Carolina native segued to the right side of the law and executive producer Quentin Tarantino tapped him to portray a good guy in Dusk to Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (1999).

“Tarantino told me that he loved my work and that he had this part” he said. “Well I got the script and said ‘Sure I’ll do this. This is great.’ Well they didn’t tell me they were going to shoot in South Africa.”

In The Wild Bunch Hopkins’ character a volatile young member of the gang terrorizes a group of hostages inside a bank before meeting a horrible end in a hail of bullets. Just before his demise he utters one of the film’s most quotable lines — “Well how’d you like to kiss my sister’s black cat’s ass?”

“They took me to special effects and had wires runnin’ up my ass up my legs. I was squibbed up 26 times” he recalled of his first big movie role. “I fuckin’ thought I was gonna go to the moon if them things ever went off. I’d never worked with squibs. Sam asked me if I wanted a T-shirt. ‘No sir’ I said. ‘I want to feel it.’ … Well see I didn’t know. I wanted to feel it experience it just like we talked about at the Actors Studio. And like a damn fool I didn’t wear a T-shirt.”

In a short but impactful performance in The Getaway (1972) Hopkins’ Frank Jackson gets his private parts blown off by his partner Rudy (Al Lettieri) during another bank robbery. Rudy in turn is shot by Doc (Steve McQueen) who takes off with the stolen loot.

Peckinpah gave Hopkins a more substantial role in The Killer Elite as a weapons expert recruited by James Caan to stop an assassination.

Hopkins added to his criminal mystique as a moonshiner alongside Burt Reynolds in White Lightning (1973) and as Tex a mysterious man who seals Billy Hayes’ (Brad Davis) fate in Midnight Express (1978).

William Mauldin Hopkins was born on Feb. 2 1938 in Greenville South Carolina. His father worked at a local mill while his mother stayed home with the children. At age 39 his dad had a heart attack and died on the porch of his home in front of his wife and son.

Hopkins was sent to live with his grandparents when his mom remarried the following year then learned when he was 12 that he was adopted at nine months old. He eventually met his birth mother and got to know his half-siblings.

Quite the handful growing up Hopkins said he used to steal money from family members to treat his friends to the movies. He was headed to reform school after a botched robbery when he enlisted in the U.S. Army just before his 17th birthday.

“I don’t know how my mother and grandmother put up with me” Hopkins remembered. “Later I went back home and took them to see The Wild Bunch and my second movie [1969’s] The Bridge at Remagen. And that’s when everybody who said I was gonna end up in prison said they always knew Billy was going to make something of himself.”

After the service which included nine months in Korea Hopkins returned to Greenville and landed a role in a production of The Teahouse of the August Moon in a local theater then received a scholarship to Kentucky’s Pioneer Playhouse. “I think there were 180 people trying out for summer stock” he said. “I didn’t even know what summer stock was.”

Hopkins’ Pioneer Playhouse experience led to an opportunity to perform in a play in New York and he was in an off-Broadway production of Bus Stop when the producers asked him to change his name. He took his character’s first name and Bo Hopkins was born.

After just a few months in the city and another stint back home Hopkins decided to try his luck in Hollywood and received a scholarship to an acting school at the Desilu-Cahuenga Studios and then a spot as an observer at the L.A. outpost of The Actors Studio.

With Diane Davis as his agent Hopkins made his onscreen debut in 1966 on an episode of The Phyllis Diller Show. “After the Phyllis Diller thing I did a Gunsmoke then The Andy Griffith Show playing Goober’s helper” he said. “George Lindsey always said he was the one who started my career.”

Other early TV appearances came on The Virginian The Wild Wild West Judd for the Defense and The Rat Patrol.

Hopkins’ time at Desilu also led to his breakthrough role. Wild Bunch actor William Holden heard about his performance in a stage production of Picnic and recommended him to screenwriter Roy N. Sickner who convinced Peckinpah to give Hopkins a shot as Crazy Lee.

Two of Hopkins’ favorite outlaw gigs came in 1975 when he played Turner a high-strung would-be Mafioso who liked to dress like a cowboy in the independent neo-noir film The Nickel Ride and as gangster Pretty Boy Floyd in the ABC telefilm The Kansas City Massacre.

As a go-to guy for lawmen he portrayed sheriffs in A Small Town in Texas (1976) Sweet Sixteen (1983) Mutant (1984) Trapper County War (1989) The Bounty Hunter (1989) The Final Alliance (1990) Fertilize the Blaspheming Bombshell (1992) Texas Payback (1995) and A Crack in the Floor (2001).

Hopkins’ other features included The Moonshine War (1970) Monte Walsh (1970) The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (1973) Posse (1975) Tentacles (1977) The Fifth Floor (1978) Big Bad John (1990) Radioland Murders (1994) and U Turn (1997).

He also had recurring roles as the adulterous Matthew Blaisdel on ABC’s Dynasty and as renegade disbarred lawyer John Cooper on NBC’s The Rockford Files in 1978-79 and guest-starred on other shows like Barnaby Jones Charlie’s Angels Fantasy Island The A-Team Scarecrow and Mrs. King and Murder She Wrote.

In 2020 Hopkins appeared in his final film Hillbilly Elegy directed by Ron Howard marking a reunion with his American Graffiti co-star. “That was quite a thrill for him” his wife said.

Survivors also include his children Matthew and Jane."

I’m sweating. My bladder is sending out distress signals. I’ve been going full throttle for three hours and have five hours to go but I can’t slow down. Not when the stakes are so high: I’m representing my country among the best competitors on Earth sandwiched between teams from Turkey and Bulgaria. I am competing in the equivalent of an Ironman triathlon for assembling little cardboard pieces. No seriously. I’m representing Team USA at the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship.

A few months ago I didn’t know such a competition existed. But it does and these people are serious and several hundred have gathered in a small town in Spain. Team USA consists of me my wife and two teenage sons. We are at one of dozens of tables inside a hot dome. We’ve practised for a month but nothing like the jigsaw masters who have trained several hours a day for years.

A man in a blazer reads out the instructions into a microphone: we have eight hours to complete four large puzzles. Tres dos uno … puzzle! We grab one of the boxes on our table – an African safari scene. Immediately we’re at a disadvantage. Other teams have brought letter openers and knives to rip off the plastic wrapping on the box. Team USA are reduced to using our fingernails. Dammit. We dump everything out and try to snap some of the grey pieces together but they don’t fit. “I wish I’d brought a hammer” my son says. Good idea. But even that probably wouldn’t be enough.

How did I get here? Well it’s not because I’m brilliant at jigsaws. I do love puzzles but my specialities are word and logic puzzles. Then three years ago I signed up to write a book on puzzles and why I and millions of others obsess over them. The book would explore my hunch that puzzles aren’t a waste of time. They are instead a force for good. They make us better thinkers and better people – maybe even help save the world.

The first jigsaw was a map glued to a board and carved up to teach aristocratic kids which countries to colonise later

I knew I had to write a chapter on jigsaws – they are perhaps the prototypical puzzle the one that comes to mind when you say the word “puzzle”. But I wasn’t excited about it. Jigsaws were possibly my least favourite genre of puzzles. I didn’t hate them but I saw them as more of a chore than a joy more akin to loading the dishwasher than eating lemon meringue pie. I thought they lacked nuance and surprise. Well I have seen the error of my ways. I’m a jigsaw convert and evangelist.

A few months before the pandemic I began my deep-dive into jigsaws with a Google search. I discovered the first was created by a British cartographer named John Spilsbury around 1760. He glued a map to a wooden board and carved it up in order to teach aristocratic kids geography so they could know which countries to invade and colonise later. I learned that jigsaws were originally created by hand with a jigsaw hence the name.

Then far into my search results I spotted an intriguing link: the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship was taking place in Spain in about six weeks. Nearly 40 countries were represented – Brazil Bulgaria Malaysia Canada Italy and on and on. Yet oddly no Team USA. On a whim I filled out the application for the four-person team event. I figured this would be the first step in a rigorous screening process – timed trials perhaps an interview – that I would surely fail. A day later an email pinged back: “Congratulations. You are confirmed as Team USA in the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship.”

I was thrilled and horrified. I mean I know it’s not the Olympics. But still there’s pressure. It’s an international competition and I will be representing my fellow 330 million Americans. “It’s your patriotic duty” I told my reluctant teammates. They were sceptical but agreed to do it as long as there wasn’t a uniform. No problem.

I realised my family needed coaching so I called up Karen Kavett a New Jersey native with a popular YouTube channel about jigsaws. She gave us a crash course in speed-solving. Yes you should usually start with the edges – but not always it depends on how colourful the puzzle is: some experts start by sorting the colours instead assembling those then working outwards.

If you’re not sure two pieces actually fit together hold them up to the light and make sure no brightness seeps through.

Sometimes you should work backwards: visualise what’s missing and look for that piece. When confronted with a dreaded big sky or any other monochromatic expanse switch strategies and sort by shape rather than colour. Make a pile of pieces with two outies and two innies another pile with one outie and three innies and so on. This will make it easier to assemble.

We practised on weekends but felt woefully unprepared as we flew off to Valladolid a small city two hours’ drive north of Madrid. The tournament took place at the Millennium Dome a bubble-shaped structure with an indoor space the size of a minor league baseball stadium. The floor was packed with jigsaw enthusiasts hundreds of them. I saw shoulders wrists and calves adorned with jigsaw tattoos. I saw jigsaw earrings and jigsaw-patterned clothes.

My family were wearing jigsaw T-shirts too. Yes I know. I promised my kids they wouldn’t have to. But I couldn’t resist designing customised shirts for my first world championship. After much cajoling my sons and wife reluctantly put them on. The shirts featured a US flag in the shape of a jigsaw piece along with the motto “E pluribus unum pictura”. It translates as: “Out of many one picture.”

We were shown to our spot one of 86 tables (some countries have more than one team) each with a name card adorned with a flag. The Turkish team consisted of four women wearing hijabs and skirts with a jigsaw pattern. “I can’t believe it but I’ve got butterflies” my wife Julie said. She started doing stretches as if she were running a 5K. One of the Turkish puzzlers had her head down and hands cupped in prayer. I said my own secular prayer to myself: please don’t let us finish last.

Let me pause the white-knuckle action here to say that my newfound love was eerily timely. Just a few months after the tournament the pandemic shut down the world and all of a sudden jigsaws were everywhere as coveted as hand sanitiser. The Onion ran the headline “Violently Bored Americans Begin Looting Puzzle Stores”.

That didn’t happen as far as I know. But the gist was true. Facebook feeds filled up with families piecing together jigsaws of Renoirs or The Little Mermaid. Celebrities got in on it with Ellen DeGeneres posting a photo of her table covered with a 4000-piece puzzle. Factories and retailers struggled to keep up with demand. “It almost feels like a war footing” one told the New York Times. One retailer reported a quadrupling of sales.

This boom tapped into a side of jigsaws that is almost the polar opposite of speed-solving. People don’t want to solve their puzzles quickly. Speed is the enemy. They want to fill their days. I interviewed several psychologists about what drove the jigsaw boom and they talked about the mental health benefits. Jigsaws are Paxil in cardboard form. They are meditative. They take our minds off our problems. They’re an exercise in creating order out of chaos when the world seems particularly chaotic. They provide closure and certainty. They allow families to cooperate instead of squabbling. They tap into the flow state when hours pass by like minutes.

Jigsaw fans compare them to other stress-busting activities. On one podcast devoted jigsawer Hugh Jackman says that when the pieces click together it gives him the same satisfaction as popping a zit (his words not mine). I watch a Netflix series where a religious woman tries to explain sex to a naive new bride. She says sex is like a jigsaw puzzle – the pieces just fit.

During the pandemic my family and I explored the limits of puzzles. At one point I bought the world’s biggest jigsaw – a whopping 48000 pieces – thinking it would be a fun challenge. It was not. It arrived in a box the size of a small refrigerator. I told my wife we might have to move to the suburbs to make room for it.

Each night my family and I knelt on the living room floor and got to work. The puzzle featured scenes of beautiful locations around the world. We started with Santorini the Greek island. We began with the windmills and the blue church domes. We finished a couple of weeks later with the whitewashed cottages and sandy hills. Now just 23 other scenic cities to go!

And then three days into Tokyo I went online to check the latest puzzle news and saw a crushing article: Kodak had just come out with a new world’s biggest puzzle. A 51300-piecer of international landmarks such as the Taj Mahal and the Colosseum. Ugh. Even if we finished ours we would still not have completed the biggest jigsaw ever. My motivation faded. We taped Santorini to a big sheet of cardboard and stashed it in the closet where it sits today a mocking reminder of overambition. Four hundred dollars gone. Damn.

Lesson learned: mega-puzzles weren’t for us. But was there another kind of extreme jigsaw experience to be had while stuck inside? The answer was yes. And it was provided by a small company in Vermont that is iconic in the jigsaw world. Founded in 1974 Stave make beautiful hand-cut wooden jigsaws that are notable for two reasons. First they are insanely expensive from $400 (£235) to $10000 (£8200) – Bill Gates is a fan as he can afford to be. Second they are hard. Really hard. They run from challenging to nearly impossible. The founder gleefully refers to himself as Chief Tormentor.

At the two-hour mark a mini-crisis. On the carpet between our table and the Bulgarians' I spot a piece

As I was writing a book on puzzles the folks at Stave loaned me a handful of their puzzles. One weekend my teenage son and I opened one of the dark blue boxes – there’s no image on the cover to give you a clue. The pieces are tricky: edge pieces look like middle pieces. There are pieces carved in whimsical shapes such as dolphins and fishermen. There are pieces from other puzzles that don’t belong at all but are there to throw you off. There are pieces that fit in multiple ways.

At one point I laughed out loud when a piece required being flipped to the opposite side. I never thought I’d laugh at a jigsaw puzzle but there I was chuckling like a fool. My wife joined us for 20 minutes before saying she preferred the meditative joy of regular jigsaws: “I have enough frustration in my life.” The puzzle – which turned out to be an aquarium full of fish – was just the right amount of frustration for me.

Other Stave puzzles were well outside my zone. They produced far too much vexation. Olivia the Octopus considered Stave’s hardest has 10000 possible arrangements of the pieces but only one is correct (and allows the octopus to fit inside the coral reef). My niece actually left the room screaming at one point.

But the mid-level Stave puzzles? I’m a big fan. I’ve even grappled with the puzzle of how to afford them. Some solutions: you can borrow them from generous friends buy them used or try a company called Liberty which produces cheaper (though still pricey) woodcut puzzles. These helped get me through the pandemic. They kept my mind occupied and taught me life lessons such as expect the unexpected have grit be flexible in your cognition. Small differences can have outsize effects.

OK back to the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship action. Team USA is 15 minutes in and we’ve been busy sorting edges and colours. It’s become clear the monkey will be a problem – it’s the same colour as the tree. “Monkeys used to be my favourite animal” Julie says. “Don’t make me hate you monkeys!” I love that Julie once sceptical has fully committed. She’s trash-talking the puzzle.

We’re making headway on the zebras but the elephant is troublesome. He and the rhino are both grey but slightly different. This is a good life lesson I tell my sons. Life is full of subtleties different shades of grey. Nothing is black and white. No response. I tell myself it’s because they’re focused.

At the two-hour mark a mini-crisis. On the carpet between our table and the Bulgarians I spot a yellow and green piece. “Is that yours?” I ask them. “Not ours” says a Bulgarian man with a tone that implies: “Do we look like we’d make a rookie mistake like that?” I pick it up. Imagine the nightmare I just dodged – a missing piece at the end. I glance at the Bulgarians’ puzzle. They’re close to finishing only missing the lake and sky. On the other hand we are not close to finishing. In fact we are well behind every other team I can see.

At around four hours we hear a hubbub. A scrum of people around a table on the far side of the dome are chattering holding iPhones aloft to get a video. “What’s happening?” I ask a group of Canadians near our table.

“It’s the Russians. They are close to finishing.”

“Finishing a puzzle?”

“No finishing.”

As in all four puzzles.

The hive around the Russian table buzzes louder. Moments later a loud cheer. I see four women emerge from the mob. They’re in their 20s wearing T-shirts in the colours of the Russian flag. They walk to the stage to be interviewed by the man in the blazer. “Campeones del mundo!” he says. They are beaming. “That’s insane” one son says. “How’d they do that?” Someone at the next table suggests the Russians are doping. I can’t tell if he’s kidding. “Just keep working” I say.

Every five or six minutes we hear another burst of applause. The Brazilians finish. Then Japan. Then Mexico. Each is a knee to my ribs. Finally at six hours and two minutes we do it. We finish. Our first puzzle that is. My sons don’t even fight about who gets to put in the last piece which makes me proud. Julie whoops it up and applauds. Other tables join in before realising we’re only one-fourth of the way through.

Later the results are posted on a TV screen. I jostle to see it and there we are. Way down at the bottom. But not the very bottom. We beat one of the home-town Spanish teams. I don’t mind being second to last. I don’t even mind being beaten by a man from Uganda who is colour-blind but loves puzzles so much he still chose it as his hobby. A colour-blind jigsaw champion! That’s inspiring. Like Jim Abbott baseball’s one-handed pitcher. It’s humiliating yes. But we are in the mix here with the best of the world participating not spectating.

During the awards ceremony the Russian team accept their €1000 (£849) prize along with a jigsaw-shaped trophy. I approach to congratulate them and ask for an interview. “Where are you from?” I ask Irina who acts as their spokesperson as she speaks better English than the others. “Siberia.” Makes sense I think. What else is there to do in Siberia? I don’t say it out loud. I’m sure they’ve heard the same lame observation a thousand times.

“What’s your secret?”

“I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.”

Fair enough. But Irina relents and tells me one key to success: division of labour. One of them specialises in sorting colours; another edges. Yet another solves the monochromatic sections – skies oceans – by shape.

“Wait a moment please” Irina says. She goes off to a duffel bag and returns with a little stuffed animal. Their team mascot: Ivan the bear. “We want you to have this.” The world is now cut off from ordinary Russians due to Putin’s unjust war but this scene long before the invasion was a lovely moment of humanity.

As absurd as a jigsaw puzzle tournament might seem and as badly as we performed I enjoyed this experience for many reasons. I got to spend time with my kids who took a break from Nintendo Switch. I got to see people performing at peak skill even if this skill isn’t one prized by the Olympic Committee or ESPN. (I later watched a video of the Russian team solving. Their hands flew around the table so quickly I had to check to make sure the video wasn’t on double speed.)

I felt part of a community that transcends national borders. Geopolitics is a messy business. Just like many things in life the pieces don’t fit smoothly. But every bit of face-to-face interaction helps. Jigsaw diplomacy. There’s even research on how puzzles are a unifying force. The Harvard law professor and behavioural economist Cass Sunstein studied methods that would bridge the gap between liberals and conservatives. He found that one of the only activities that brought them together was jointly solving a crossword puzzle. More evidence for my thesis: puzzles can help save the world.

And most of all I felt gratitude. I’m fortunate enough to be in a position where I can enjoy mental pain. That’s a crazy luxury. It’s like marathons – our ancestors didn’t find pleasure in running 26 miles on a weekend then going out to brunch. They were too busy fleeing predators and rival tribes. Same with these puzzles. Our brains were evolved to solve problems such as “How do I eat?” but we get to use them for fitting together colourful wooden pieces. I am a lucky bastard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzc29jY2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjIvMDUvMjAteWVhcnMtbGF0ZXItcmV0cmFjaW5nLXRoZS11c21udHMtMjAwMi13b3JsZC1jdXAtcXVhbGlmeWluZy1ydW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20 Years Later: Retracing the USMNT's 2002 World Cup Qualifying Run,"The Americans became the sixth Concacaf team since 1950 to roll off three successive wins to open the final round.

The USA had a month and half off before playing twice within a five-day period. However two catalysts of the early wins Mathis (torn ACL) and Wolff (fractured left foot) were sidelined for the rest of qualifying campaign.

If they could win twice the Americans would have 15 points considered to be the magic qualifying number. That would have been accomplished only halfway through their 10-game schedule.

""There is a buzz"" midfielder Chris Armas said. ""You hear different guys saying 'Can we clinch with the next two wins?' Everyone is thinking it and feeling it but it's not going to get any easier.""

Entering the June 16 encounter Jamaica was riding a remarkable 50-game unbeaten streak at its National Stadium in Kingston dubbed ""The Office."" The last foe to emerge victorious? The U.S. behind a 3-0 win on Nov. 22 1994.

Stadium gates opened at 6 a.m. with some of the country's favorite Reggae stars entertaining the fans until kickoff. Most of the crowd of 32000 was a sea of yellow wearing national colors with a strong aroma of marijuana punctuating the air.

The USA could not break the streak emerging with a scoreless draw and a road point as temperatures soared toward 100 degrees on a rock-yard surface which didn't make for pretty soccer.

""It's a great result because we're taking away two points from Jamaica at home"" Reyna said. ""We're sitting really good right now.""

The Americans continued their unbeaten streak on June 20 with a 2-0 win over Trinidad & Tobago in Foxborough. Razov scored only 74 seconds after kickoff the fastest U.S. qualifying goal in at least a dozen years. Stewart added an insurance tally in the 20th minute becoming the U.S.'s all-time scoring leader (seven goals) snapping a tie with National Soccer Hall of Famer Willy Roy.

""Fantastic"" Stewart said at the time. ""Thirteen points out of 15 - can't get much better than that. This is a great start.""

With five games remaining in the Hex the USMNT (4-0-1; 13 points) enjoyed a commanding lead and were on the verge of qualifying. But the squad started a downward slide via a 1-0 loss at Mexico with a new coach Javier Aguirre in charge at Estadio Azteca on July 1.

The USA wasn't helped when John O'Brien's club Ajax refused to release the midfielder citing that he needed to train for its UEFA Cup qualifying tournament. This was prior to FIFA setting WCQ playing dates.

""It's a classless thing to do"" Arena said at the time.

A botched offside trap allowed Jared Borgetti to score off a 12-yard header in the 16th minute past Keller.

""We were the most dangerous Mexican player"" defender Jeff Agoos said of the defeat. ""I don't think we deserved to win. We were our own worst enemy.""

The Honduras match at RFK Stadium on Sept. 1 was to start at the unappealing hour of 10 a.m. An early kickoff may sound like gamesmanship to try to get the upper hand but with ESPN having the TV contract it was the only time the game could be televised on the first college football Saturday of the season.

When Pope walked out for the pregame warm-up he expected to hear the 54032 fans cheering. Instead Honduran fans dominated the venue.





""That's a perfect example of you accidentally putting it in the wrong location"" he said. ""Your intentions are to tactically make it a home crowd and it is the opposite. We see all these white and blue shirts. That had an impact. You're looking for your fans. The stadium now is louder for the other team and you end up playing an away game at home.

""You've already experienced being away and taking the abuse from the other team's fans. Now you're at home. You look up and you're looking for your fans. It can be deflating.""

Nineteen-year-old Landon Donovan made his World Cup Qualifying debut that day. “My introduction was like oh [crap] this is real stuff” he said. “It just was different than anything I've ever seen in my life. It was a crazy experience.”

At times the Americans played as though they were sleep walking on defense in a devastating 3-2 loss. Stewart found the net in the seventh and 84th minutes but it was the goal that he didn't score that haunted the hosts. His PK was saved in the 43rd minute by Noel Valladares switching the momentum.

""It's not so much missing a penalty kick” Stewart said at the time. “It's when you look at your teammates and see that you've let them down.""

Instead of enjoying a 2-1 halftime lead the U.S. saw its fortunes sink when Carlos Pavon converted a 53rd-minute penalty. Milton Nunez also tallied for Honduras (27th and 77th minutes).

""The most painful thing is actually we started off well"" Stewart said. ""We didn't score had the chance to go up and then I missed the PK. Those really weigh on your mind. Then they started to play really well.""

It was the U.S.'s second consecutive qualifying loss the first time that happened since 1980. The Americans also saw their 19-game home qualifying unbeaten streak broken losing for the first time since May 1985. They allowed three goals in a home qualifier for the first time since 1960.

Four days later in Costa Rica the U.S. deployed a revamped lineup that played like it wanted to get out of Saprissa with a scoreless draw in what turned into a 2-0 loss. Ronaldo Fonseca had a brace (40th and 68th minutes).

***

When the USMNT walked onto the Foxboro Stadium field in on Oct. 7 the players knew they were shouldering a massive responsibility.

Beyond the fact they needed to break a three-game losing streak and bolster their chances of qualifying – a loss would have eliminated them from contention - the Americans knew they were playing for their country as well.

The nation was still grieving after the horrific terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center the Pentagon and a plane that crashed in Shanksville Pa. which left almost 3000 dead and an estimated 25000 injured on Sept. 11.",,,,,,,,,

Gary Sinise the award-winning actor humanitarian and founder of the nonprofit Gary Sinise Foundation is serving again this year as honorary grand marshal of the National Memorial Day Parade in Washington D.C. which takes place on Memorial Day itself.

Some 5000 participants are expected to parade down Constitution Avenue before a crowd of 250000 people on Monday according to the American Veterans Center in Arlington Virginia.

Sinise shared personal and deeply felt thoughts with Fox News Digital about how ""incredibly important"" it is to show support for America's military and their families today.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO HONORS THE MEMORY OF 200000 FALLEN WAR HEROES

""Memorial Day has been a longstanding tradition of remembrance for me and my family"" Sinise told Fox News Digital just ahead of the holiday weekend.

""It's incredibly important to honor the families of the fallen."" — Gary Sinise to Fox News Digital

""As a nation it’s incredibly important to honor the families of the fallen — the heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice in protecting and defending our country"" he said.

He also said ""Through my many travels visiting combat zones our wounded in the hospitals and especially spending time with our precious families of our fallen heroes — it has become a personal life mission to honor and remember those who selflessly serve and sacrifice so much.""

""We’re here for them before during and after the battle.""

Added Sinise ""That is one of the many reasons why I created the Gary Sinise Foundation because I want all our defender communities our veterans service members first responders and their families who sacrifice alongside them to always know that there are grateful Americans who love and appreciate them.""

LEE GREENWOOD DISCUSSES MEMORIAL DAY AND ‘REMEMBERING THOSE WHO SERVED’

""And I am grateful for every day that I have — to continue paying it forward to these brave men and women and ensuring that their memory and legacy of service to our country will never be forgotten"" said Sinise.

""I am grateful to support the families of our fallen heroes.""

The Gary Sinise Foundation established over 10 years ago by Sinise — who for nearly 40 years has been active in his commitment to veterans first responders and defenders — announced in April that it was moving its headquarters from Los Angeles California to Nashville Tennessee.

The move ""complements its chapters on both coasts in San Diego California and Orlando Florida"" the organization said in late April.

It ""will allow the foundation to expand its reach and service to more veterans defenders heroes and first responders who sacrifice so much.""

The foundation noted that some 430000 veterans live in Tennessee today.

""Tennessee and the neighboring states are in proximity to numerous active military installations and facilities.""

""In addition Tennessee and the neighboring states are in proximity to numerous active military installations and facilities. The move to Nashville will facilitate even more engagement with local communities including first responders and other heroes around the United States"" the group shared with Fox News Digital.

Sinise said in that announcement that moving to Nashville ""was a family decision. After 35 years in California I began thinking about the possibility of relocating.""

""With so many friends in the area a great entertainment industry and its central location I concluded it would be an exciting change for our family.""

""Naturally"" he added ""the Gary Sinise Foundation will move as well.""

The move is expected to be finished by summer.

Through its R.I.S.E. (Restoring Independence Supporting Empowerment) program in Tennessee the foundation has built smart homes for severely wounded heroes including most recently for a Clarksville Tennessee Army veteran.

The group has also lent support to ""numerous events for those who served in the Nashville area.""

AWK,American Water Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbmR5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMi8wNS80NS1taWxsaW9uLXVwZ3JhZGUtdG8tdmFsbGV5LXdhdGVyLXN1cHBsaWVyLXJlYWR5LXRvLXJ1bi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$45 million upgrade to Valley water supplier ready to run,"MINERAL RIDGE — When the Mahoning Valley Sanitary District begins renovations to its Meander Reservoir Dam in the next couple of years the dam will better withstand a rare flood event and seismic activity such as earthquakes.

Michael McNinch chief engineer for MVSD which provides water for 220000 area customers says the $45 million in upgrades includes a measure that will address the increase in earthquakes in the community since 2011 and the possibility of flooding.

A North Side Youngstown injection well was blamed for causing earthquakes in 2011 culminating in a magnitude-4.0 earthquake on Dec. 31 2011. The injection well was later closed. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources also identifies an injection well on state Route 169 in Weathersfield as the source of two earthquakes — one July 28 2014 and one Aug. 31 2014. The July earthquake was a magnitude 1.7 and the August earthquake was 2.1.

McNinch said one primary improvement to the dam will be installation of anchors through the primary spillway into the bedrock.

“This will be done to make sure the spillway does not shift or move as a result of an earthquake” or a significant flood McNinch said.

He and other MVSD officials have been following the legal and administrative activities associated with the American Water Management injection well in Weathersfield which is regulated by ODNR McNinch said. He said the reason is that it “could have a seismic effect on the dam.”

American Water Management and ODNR are debating what type of rules the American Water Management well should follow to prevent the injection well from causing earthquakes that could damage the community including the Meander Reservoir dam.

A recent ODNR filing in a case before the Ohio Oil and Gas Commssion states the Meander dam is “just three miles away” from the Weathersfield well and the dam is a “special risk” as it “serves as the sole drinking water source for over 220000 people and holds approximately 11 billion gallons of water.”

The filing adds that a study carried out by the engineering firm Gannett Fleming noted that the dam was “not designed using modern standards to withstand earthquakes.” Furthermore “detailed engineering studies by Gannett Fleming indicated that the dam’s existing upstream slope does not meet current safety criteria for the maximum credible earthquake loadings.”

It says that a “a major earthquake could have catastrophic consequences” because it is “upstream from homes businesss and industrial sites that would be catastrophically flooded in the event of its breach.”

The filing quotes Weathersfield fire Chief Tom Lambert as saying such a flood would “totally flood out the south side of Niles downtown Niles and keep heading toward the city of Warren.” Lambert said “There would be a lot of lives involved.”

The Meander Reservoir dam is 50 feet high and 3550 feet long with a 260-foot primary spillway located just southwest of the state Route 46 and Salt Springs Road intersection in Mineral Ridge.

Former MVSD president Matt Blair expressed concerns over the safety of the dam in 2017 wondering whether injection-well-induced seismic activity in Youngstown and Weathersfield were contributing to cracks in MVSD buildings and the dam.

HOLLOWAY

However Tom Holloway operator of record at the Meander Water Treatment Plant and former MVSD chief engineer said last week the Gannett Fleming study indicated that seismic activity had not caused any significant damage to the MVSD facilities including the dam.

“There are no serious cracks in the dam. There are age cracks and things of that nature and the same thing with buildings. We looked close at the dam and the buildings … but there was no significant damage from the one seismic activity we had here” Holloway said.

Holloway was referring to the magnitude-4.0 Dec. 31 2011 earthquake caused by a D&L Energy injection well on Ohio Works Drive in Youngstown. But he clarified that he was also referring to the two lesser earthquakes that occurred near an American Water Management Services injection well on state Route 169 in Weathersfield.

“Most of cracks here on the buildings is over time age and some settlement of the buildings. There was no significant findings that there is a serious crack or issue with the dam” Holloway said.

Blair and the rest of the MVSD board were in the planning stages for the dam renovation in 2017.

“Our dam wasn’t built for earthquakes” Blair said in 2017. “When we build out there if the ground is becoming more unstable we have to build in a different way like California so we don’t have cracking. It’s kind of a new problem for us.”

FLOODING

Apart from earthquake issues are ones associed with flooding.

A key concept is the “probable maximum flood” McNinch said explaining that the probable maximum flood for this area is 19 inches of rain in a 24-hour period which would be rare.

The Ohio Department of Natural Resources defines a probable maximum precipitation event as “the greatest depth (amount) of precipitation for a given storm duration that is theoretically possible for a particular area and geographic location” and the probable maximum flood event as “the flood that may be expected from the most severe combination of critical meteorological and hydrologic conditions that are reasonably possible in a particular drainage area.”

The Vindicator reported last November that according to the National Weather Service the record amount of rainfall the Youngstown area received in one day since 1931 was 4.65 inches on July 21 2003. In the last 10 years the most rain the area received in a one-day period was 3.96 inches on July 10 2013.

Engineers working on behalf of the MVSD determined that if the reservoir got 19 inches of rain in a 24-hour period “there was the potential” that the dam might “over top” or that “parts of our spillways would shift” McNinch said.

At that point it is possible the dam could “breach” meaning water might create an opening or “breakthrough” allowing water to go downstream and endanger people.

“The probability of it is extremely low but the consequences are extremely high” McNinch said of a breach of the dam. “There is no immediate threat of a dam failure. What we are trying to do is future proof. We’re trying to update the dam to be able to sustain a potential probable maximum flood” he said.

“The dam was built with 1920s technology and it came online in 1931 so it’s approaching 100 years old. So just like any other major structure you need to do preventative maintenance and that is what we are looking at” McNinch said.

Holloway and McNinch have said one upgrade to the dam will be raising the curb on the dam because at the height it is now it “could wash out and fail” Holloway said.

“Part of the project is to make sure that the curb is the same elevation / height across the entire width of the dam” McNinch said. If there was a probable maximum flood it is possible that water “could bypass the primary and auxiliary spillway which could cut into the earthen part of the dam and then into the concrete core wall leading to a dam failure” McNinch said. The concrete core wall is inside of the earthen portion of the dam McNinch said.

The dam rehabilitaton also will construct a new auxiliary spillway flatten downstream embankments upgrade dam-related instrumentation electric service and lighting and replace east and west dam access roads.

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY

In mid-May the MVSD ran a legal ad asking for companies to bid by June 7 on a contract to perform an environmental assessment regarding the renovation. The cost is estimated at $100000.

McNinch said the Ohio Emergency Management Agency recommended that the MVSD perform the assessment to improve the district’s chances of being approved for $30 million in grant money it is seeking from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to pay for the $45 million in dam renovations.

The assessment “basically researches all of the impacts — environmental ecological any potential flooding — that could occur while the construction is under way” McNinch said. It would also assess any potential historical implications.

The MVSD hopes to have the environmental assessment complete by this fall and will apply by Jan. 1 2023 for the $30 million grant.

The engineering for the renovations is complete and some of the funding — about $12 million — has been set side for the renovation McNinch said. “We received almost all of our permits from the state and federal level. We’re working closely with ODNR (on a construction permit) and are expecting that permit to be finalized in the next couple of weeks. We are that far along” McNinch said.

2023

“We are planning for going out for construction bids in the fall of 2023 because the primary driving factor is safety but the other key issue is inflation” McNinch said. “It is a $45.456 million project as of January of this year but it’s about 8 percent annual inflation so if we wait another year the full project has gone up $3.2 million” he said.

He expects the renovation to go forward next year with or without the $30 million grant.

If the grant is not awarded “We have a mechanism to go forward in a worst-case scenario to pay for it in-house through our rate structure” McNinch said. By that he means that ongoing revenue for the nonprofit MVSD would be used to pay for the renovations.

If the federal grant application is successful the MVSD will add $15 million in matching funds to the $30 million grant. The district’s ongoing revenues would be used for other ongoing MVSD improvements.

“We are always upgrading improving making sure that we are in the best possible position to serve everybody in the entire region” he said.

“We’re trying to keep our costs as low as possible by getting any grant money that is out there” McNinch said. “We have gotten tremendous support regionwide. I’m talking about township trustees at every level local mayors all the way up to the federal level and Congressman Johnson and Congressman Tim Ryan.”

U.S. Rep Bill Johnson a Republican of Marietta toured the MVSD facilities in November to learn more about it and the renovation. Johnson’s 6th Congressional District will include all of Trumbull and Mahoning counties starting with this year’s election. It will also include Columbiana Jefferson Carroll Harrison Belmont Noble and Monroe counties and all but four townships in Washington County.

The Meandor Resevoir provides drinking water to about 220000 people in Mahoning and Trumbull counties.

Johnson expressed support for the renovation project.

“This is real infrastructure” Johnson said. “We’ll certainly fight for it you don’t need to sell me on the need for it because this is not unlike the water systems or sewer systems throughout Appalachia or throughout my region of the state.”

Most efforts to protect our dwindling clean water reserves have been blocked by political self-interest and the results are potentially disastrous not only for America’s large cities but for farmlands and recreation areas as well. These and other disturbing truths are recorded here by Donald E. Carr a veteran research chemist whose book DEATH OF THE SWEET WATERS will be published later this month by Norton.

by Donald E. Carr

THE United States is the biggest water hog in the world. Poor tropical countries use less than 5 gallons of water per person per day. Large commercial towns in England use about 50 gallons a day while the daily average for such towns in the United States is close to 200 gallons per person. The highest water consumption of any city in the world is that of Beverly Hills California — over 500 gallons per person per day where in an arid climate immense lawns are sprinkled the year around and countless swimming pools are filled and refilled.

Modern manufacturing processes also use enormous quantities of water. It takes 18 barrels of water to refine a barrel of oil 300 gallons to make a barrel of beer 600 to 1000 tons of water for each ton of coal burned in a steam-power plant and 250 tons of water to produce a ton of paper. A large paper mill will use more water than a city of 50000 people.

Industries are located near water for three cogent reasons: manufacturing plants use lots of water they must have a place to dispose of the dirty water which is not consumed in the manufacturing process (a very large percentage) and they can often save money by delivering their products by barge rather than by truck or railroad. Industrially polluted water is rarely fit to drink; it is dangerous to swim in lethal for fish and often spoiled for manufacturing processes of other plants downstream. The water of a big industrial river such as the Ohio may be reused a dozen times before it reaches its rendezvous with the Mississippi. Twenty-six rivers in the United States are so badly polluted that the federal government has intervened. Dozens of others are dangerously polluted but the federal agencies have not had time or opportunity to start any action in regard to them. By law the Public Health Service can act on its own in pollution emergencies involving two or more states but within a single state it must await the invitation of the governor.

In general private industrialists are united to a man against federal regulation of water pollution. They prefer state control if any. As it is now each state has its own set of standards for water cleanliness most of them very tolerant. The fact that states along the same river basin may have quite widely varying standards makes it difficult for the Department of Health Education and Welfare to handle interstate pollution. This is the chief justification for the Water Pollution Bill of 1965 which called for setting up federal standards and guidelines. The reason for the clamor against this bill on the part of private water-using industries is easy to perceive. For many years the differences between states in standards of water cleanliness have given industrialists a powerful club which they have not hesitated to use. They can threaten to move a plant downriver where the requirements aren’t so tough. Or they can threaten to move from a Northern state grown more particular to some Southern state with a more relaxed altitude.

Cries of anguish greeted the requirement in the 1965 pollution bill that waste water from riverside plants should be rendered as “clean as possible.” It was contended that the phrase should be “as clean as economically possible.”

Many industrialists base their argument on a book by Richard B. Engdahl and Frank C. Croxton Pollution: A Problem in Economics in which the key statement is this: “To completely solve the problems involved though it were technically feasible at this time would probably so increase the cost of industrial operations as to endanger our ability to compete in world markets.”

Let us examine this piece of bald-headed sophistry. Our rivers have to be filthy so that we can compete with whom? The West Germans for example? The Ruhr river basin contains nearly half of West Germany’s industrial capacity and has only a skinny streamflow much punier than the lowest flow ever recorded in the Potomac. With such a small amount of water one would expect the highly competitive West Germans to have on their hands a smelly septic barely liquid ditch. In fact the Ruhr River is clean enough to swim in and to grow fish in and with only mild treatment it provides perfectly good drinking water.

The antipollution program that accomplished what to American eyes would appear to be an “uneconomical” miracle was carried out by the Ruhr Associations — Genossenschaften semigovernmental organizations. Instead of establishing treatment requirements or purification standards and trying to enforce them the Ruhr Associations simply charge every town and every industrial plant a stiff levy proportional to the amount of pollution they deliver to the river. As a result the Ruhr Basin has been cleaned up. The water is used and reused but it is also treated and retreated. In some cases as at Essen the solid waste is dried included with the city’s normal garbage and used as fuel for a power plant.

To claim that American plants cannot do as well or would go broke trying is a deception. Nevertheless our industries have had their way so long with most of the state and local authorities that they are not likely to give up. When there is a conflict involving recreational agricultural or aesthetic use of water with industrial application industry almost always wins out. To be sure the more thoughtful industrialists are changing their viewpoints and a good deal of research on water disposal has been paid for with private funds and has been translated into full-scale treating facilities. But many of the offending plants are located in municipalities where domestic sewage winds up raw in the watercourse and thus the companies have a reasonable “Why pick on us?” argument.

Industry spokesmen point out that sewage plants at Gary Indiana and Fort Chicago Illinois for example have horribly polluted Lake Michigan for years and it is not fair to make industries in the area put in expensive pollution-control equipment. They claim that even if all further pollution were prevented it would take more than 25 years for Lake Erie to return to a theoretically clean state and 500 years for Lake Michigan to return to its preindustrial purity.

POLLUTION FROM FOOD PROCESSING

Food-processing industries especially the small operators are quite likely to take the line that if they are located in a community that doesn’t take care of its domestic sewage including the unmentionable waste from mortuaries why should anyone worry about the offal from meat-packing and dressing chickens? The Hudson River at Troy New York for example is a slimy cesspool where eels writhe and fight over chicken entrails. In Sioux City Iowa the U.S. Public Health Service held public hearings in 1958 to outargue the knownothing and do-nothing meat-packers who had been dumping stinking offal into the Missouri River thus contaminating the river waters of four states. Sugar-beet-processing wastes which smell worse than one would expect polluted the whole of the North Platte when delivered to the river in Wyoming.

Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin recalls that in his hometown on a lovely little lake the local creamery had always dumped all of its whey into the lake rendering the water useless for anything else. Everybody in the village knew about it. But the creamery was the town’s biggest employer and the local citizens never let out a peep. Finally the state water pollution commission ordered the creamery to stop.

The canning industry is a large water user especially now that the farmers who sell their vegetables or fruit to the canneries make great use of pesticides. Today it takes 50 gallons of water to wash a case of canned fruit or vegetables whereas it took half that much 20 years ago. The pesticide flows into the river.

PULP AND PAPER WASTES

No industry has had more trouble and aroused more violent public reactions because of river pollution than the pulp and paper companies. There are about 3000 such firms in the United States employing more than 600000 people. American production of paper and paperboard has more than doubled in the last two decades and is now about 40 million tons a year. The industry spokesmen make a big point of the fact that over this period a 50 percent reduction in pollution per ton of paper produced has been achieved. However this is no great consolation to other water users since they are concerned not with percentages but with amounts of gunk in the river — gunk per gallon.

What is the gunk? The worst polluter is socalled “sulfite liquor.” This is the runoff liquor containing the nonfibrous material removed from the wood chips during the cooking process. It is not toxic in the sense that it would poison an animal or infect a human being. It can be broken down by bacterial attack in the water but this requires a large amount of oxygen. Thus the worst effect of paper-and-pulp-mill wastes is that the BOD (biological oxygen demand) soars so high that fish and other water creatures are quickly suffocated. Pollution of this kind is naturally most common in those river basins where the forest cover is of the type from which paper can be made. The Northern coniferous trees are best suited to the sulfite process; hence plants using this manufacturing method are mainly in the North. The Columbia River has chronic sulfite-liquor pollution. In the last 15 years however the Kraft paper process which can handle Southern pine has resulted in the proliferation of paper mills along the Chattahoochee the Savannah and other Southern rivers.

Senator Muskie claims that the Androscoggin River in Maine is the worst-polluted stream in the country. Years ago a dam was built which trapped behind it the effluent from numerous pulp and paper mills. Even if there is no further pollution he maintains this trapped pollutant will make fish life impossible for many years perhaps forever.

Wastes from Kraft mills are alkaline rather than acid but their drain of oxygen supply is just as great. One giant mill on the Coosa River which runs through Georgia and Alabama pours into the stream wastes which absorb as much oxygen as does untreated sewage from a city of 200000 persons. These wastes although not toxic or dangerous in the way that sewage and certain byproducts of the chemical industry are have essentially the same end effect since they rob the water of oxygen needed to assimilate the more perilous gunk. Silt breaks the “chain of food” in a river or lake because it makes the water opaque to sunshine thus killing microscopic plant life. Papermill waste liquors break the chain at several links since all of the assimilation processes in fresh water except putrefaction require oxygen.

TEXTILES AND STEEL

The concentration of textile plants in the South over the past few decades has put a new load on Southern rivers. One textile mill in Georgia pours into the Chattooga River wastes equivalent in BOD to the sewage of 112000 people. The processes of bleaching cotton flax hemp and jute produce a filthy waste containing fatty and oily residue washed from the raw fabric. Wool washings make a highly polluting waste consisting of an emulsion of dirt and bacteria in water with soap and complex proteins as emulsifying agents.

Steel companies have been very effective in destroying rivers and among all industries have tended to be the least cooperative — in fact the most belligerently uncooperative. Pollution of the Mahoning River in Ohio and Pennsylvania by acid lime oil and grease discharged from steel plants has made this river unusable as a source of municipal water hindered its use by other industries and destroyed its value for recreation. The arrogant refusal of three Youngstown steel companies to give effluent data to the Public Health Service has triggered a demand for inclusion of a subpoena clause in the new federal pollution bill.

Three steel companies — the U.S. Steel in Gary Indiana Inland Steel in Chicago and Youngstown Sheet and Tube — are considered to be the chief sources of pollution in the Calumet River and the adjacent waters of Lake Michigan. The Acme Steel Company discharges raw sewage and unneutralized steel-pickling liquor (strong acid) into the Little Calumet River. The filth from the Calumet system of steel companies has affected the whole Chicago area. The currents of Lake Michigan are so sluggish that the wastes do not disperse or float away. They just sit there in the water near the shore and fester. Chicagoans don’t seem to care.

Petroleum oil and fuel have added to Lake Michigan’s mixture of assorted crud. Although the production end of the petroleum business has in the main stopped percolating oil-well brine into freshwater wells and streams some of the giant refineries located near water have not been so scrupulous. Raritan Bay in New Jersey is guaranteed to smear any small boat with oil in a few days. Even when expensive attempts are made to clean up refinery wastes some of the extremely smelly chemicals such as mercaptans and thiophenols give any potable water which they contact a lingering skunky odor. Oil chemicals are also responsible for unpleasant flavor in fish.

Heat has become the latest industrial pollution worry. The temperature of the Mahoning River in Ohio at one time reached 140 degrees Fahrenheit and higher as it picked up steel-mill effluents near Youngstown. This forced local industries to slow down operations or actually to shut down entirely during periods of low flow.

Excessive heat does a lot of things to a river some of which we do not yet understand. It kills fish. It accelerates chemical reactions causing some wastes to be toxic which would have been harmless in cool water. It strips oxygen from the water and hence reduces the ability of scavenging bacteria to do their job. On the other hand a modest amount of heating seems to make for good fishing. On Lake Erie and the Potomac and Delaware rivers at least in stretches where other pollutants are not too thick fishing is best where power companies return their once-through cooling water. The warmer water apparently stimulates the growth of fish food.

The tightest state regulations are those that Pennsylvania set up in 1960. Stream temperature may not be raised above 93 degrees Fahrenheit at any time. No new discharges may be made into a stream suitable for trout propagation if they will drive stream temperature above 58 degrees Fahrenheit. These regulations have been under steady attack. They are claimed to be unrealistic both from the standpoint of economics (costly for electric power companies) and because many warm-water organisms thrive at temperatures higher than 93 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat problem is serious for atomic energy installations on the Columbia and Savannah rivers. It will become an important factor in the location of future atomic-power as well as conventional steampower plants.

POLLUTION PREVENTION

Over the past few years some of the giant corporations have begun to spend real money on prevention of water pollution. Du Pont which makes more chemical products in its far-flung plants than anybody else accordingly has a wider diversity of waste materials to dispose of. In dealing with Du Pont federal government agencies are dealing with an entity almost as large and complex as the state of New York. Something of this company’s style and resoluteness in tackling pollution problems can be perceived by a look at operations in the Charleston West Virginia region of the Kanawha River Valley. There are twelve chemical manufacturing plants employing 25000 people. Du Pont’s Belle Works alone resulted in over 300 sources of wastes feeding into about 3 billion gallons of cooling water per day then into some 40 outfalls to the river.

In 1958 at Du Pont’s urging 9 individual firms joined with it in cooperating with the West Virginia Water Resources Division and the U.S. Geological Survey in a quantitative assay of a 62-mile stretch of the river. Du Pont’s laboratories analyzed over 1500 samples each week for 6 weeks. As a result of this survey goals of waste reduction were set up. The biological oxygen demand has been reduced in Du Pont’s own waste effluents by more than 90 percent.

Most of the highly diluted wastes are directed to a large biological treatment plant where selected bacteria destroy the organic chemicals. Foam suppressants are added; the temperature and acidity are kept at the optimum. In order to cope with the extreme swings of the river flow huge tanks of 5-million-gallon capacity are used to impound the wastes when the flow to the Kanawha dips as low as 800 cubic feet per second. The liquids are released under state supervision during the winter when the runoffs may be as high as 100000 cubic feet per second.

Du Pont is quick to try out new techniques. In one of its plants on the Sabine River it accomplishes cooling by air from giant fans rather than by water. At the Victoria Plant in Texas 4 alligators are part of the conservation system. These were put on guard to repulse an invasion of nutria (small rodents) which were in the habit of sabotaging the pond walls and canal banks.

Like the oil industry Du Pont and other big chemical companies have dug mile-deep wells to dispose of salt water and other unmanageable pollutants. Some of them are successful; some are just expensive holes in the ground.

A common Du Pont practice in most of its river plants is to conduct waste water to “passport ponds” where it is checked for pollutants before it goes back to the river.

It has been estimated that since 1963 the entire manufacturing industry has spent 4 percent of its annual $14 billion capital investment on pollution control. In many instances the amount compares poorly with what is spent on advertising — for such products as detergents as a case in point — but it is much more than it was a decade ago.

There has been a noteworthy trend toward cooperation between municipalities and private companies. If a company is bigger than the town the municipal sewage may be accommodated in the company’s waste-disposal system. Thus the three small towns of Lake and Westernport Maryland and Piedmont West Virginia on the upper Potomac all send their raw sewage into the pollutioncontrol system of the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company. Conversely when a river or lake city has a large modern sewage system it will often contract to handle waste effluents from chemical companies. The technology of treatment of sewage and of organic chemical wastes is virtually the same. Main reliance is placed on bacteriological (activated sludge) processes in both.

Cooperation of industry with state authorities reached its height in the activities of the Ohio River Valley Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO). When this body was organized in 1948 with state and industry representatives from Illinois Indiana Ohio Pennsylvania New York Virginia West Virginia and Kentucky the Ohio was the foulest-smelling river in the land. At the time sewage treating of any kind was available to only one percent of the population along the river’s banks. Today treating facilities serve 97 percent though most of them handle primary treatment only. A good deal of progress has been made in dealing with industrial wastes but in general the standards remain somewhat lenient. Furthermore 15 percent of the industries on the Ohio have failed to meet even these lenient standards.

The paper manufacturers being on the whole the worst offenders have formed a National Council for Stream Improvement. What can you do with pulp wastes? As early as 1943 the Sulfite Pulp Manufacturers’ Research League started growing yeasts on waste sulfite liquor. Nearly every sulfite plant now has a yeast plant next to it. This is not enough however to make much of a dent in the massive total of wastes.

The Kimberly-Clark Corporation has built for a Wisconsin plant a 30-million-gallon evaporating pond to store spent liquor during the summer. When partly dried this material can be used in place of asphalt for road making. The company makes no charge and pays part of the hauling. At the Niagara plant there are not enough roads in the vicinity to get rid of the liquor in this way. There a soil filtration system is used. Sandy permeable soil is sprayed with the wet liquor which is carried deep into the soil by rains. When it joins the natural groundwater it has had the equivalent of a bacterial treatment for sewage.

Other companies such as Weyerhaeuser have experimented with the use of dilute spent liquor for irrigation in the Pacific Northwest. Sprinklers are used. Unfortunately this is too expensive a way to irrigate except for crops such as tobacco and they don’t grow tobacco in the state of Washington.

For the chemical industry a new type of consultant has emerged — the professional limnologist (the freshwater expert). Limnologists will offer services such as exhaustive surveys of stream biology and chemistry before a new plant is built and continuous monitoring of stream health after it starts operating. The consultant will give advice about which sort of waste can be tolerated by the stream and which cannot. The guiding principle of limnology is that in the water “diversity is stability.” As long as each of the major types of aquatic life (bacteria algae protozoa mollusks insects fish) is represented by a relatively large number of species each doing its ecological job. the self-cleaning ability of the stream is preserved whatever pollutant may be present. But when pollution begins to drive out or destroy species leaving some of the jobs undone the stream is hurt.

This is a new science only in the sense of being applied to chemical refuse. However there are still more unknowns than knowns. Chemicals can be experimentally synthesized and put into production much faster than limnologists can decide what effect they have on the animal kingdom (including people) or the plant kingdom. In the case of lead compounds from gasoline additives it took more than 40 years of universal use before they were found unexpectedly to be dangerous.

What incentive should be offered private industry to do a real cleanup job? One possibility is tax relief. Another possibility is faster write-off for investments in pollution-abatement equipment. The Johnson Administration is also considering pollution penalties of the same type used by the Germans in the Ruhr Valley.

RAW SEWAGE

In most countries the contamination of water with sewage increases as rapidly as attempts at correction. In industrialized countries the pace of water purification barely keeps up with increased loadings. In the United States almost 20 million people still discharge raw sewage to waterways. Existing sewage-disposal plants are adequate to serve only between 70 and 80 percent of the people who use them and there is still a huge amount of raw untreated sewage that gets into the Great Lakes and the larger rivers. The St. Lawrence Waterway has brought in more ships that dump sewage into the Great Lakes. Lake Erie can be regarded as one big sewage reservoir. The multiplication of large motorboats with “heads” that simply dump raw toilet effluent into the lake is believed to have caused more than one minor hepatitis epidemic.

In 1961 various federal installations discharged over 46 million gallons of untreated sewage per day directly into surface waters or on the ground: this was 3 percent of the total estimated 1.5 billion gallons of municipal sewage discharged without treatment but it was a very dirty 3 percent. The Marine Corps base at Camp Lejeune North Carolina so polluted the New River area that a serious epidemic of viral hepatitis broke out among the residents (including marines) who ate infected oysters. Chlorination of the camp’s sewage was clearly needed immediately but repeated requests for such action from state authorities to the Department of the Navy in Washington elicited no replies whatsoever.

The Navy has also maintained a stony imperturbability in regard to the incredibly filthy shipsewage conditions which it causes in Pearl Harbor Hawaii. Under present laws and without an official complaint from the governor of Hawaii all the Public Health Service can do is wait until the sewage drifts to the California coast whereupon Governor Pat Brown can summon in the federal agencies who have express authority over interstate pollution. That could take quite a while and in the meantime the principal harbor of our fiftieth state festers and stinks like a giant cesspool.

Other federal sewage scandals exist at Hamilton Air Force Base Marin County California; Elmendorf Air Force Base Anchorage Alaska (raw sewage); England Air Force Base Rapides Parish Louisiana (raw sewage to the Red River); Philadelphia Navy Base (raw sewage and industrial waste to the Delaware River); U.S. Federal Penitentiary Steilacoom Washington (untreated sewage and wastes from cannery laundry piggery slaughterhouse and milk-processing plant discharged to Puget Sound); U.S. Coast Guard Yard Baltimore (sewage from urinals and toilets discharged to 15 septic tanks 14 of which overflow to nearby watercourses).

Although Congress has specific legislation before it to put a stop to such disgusting practices it continues to be more difficult to get the military authorities to act than to persuade the municipalities. Cleaning their own sewage is not part of their “primary mission.” If the Bureau of the Budget narrows them down to a choice between a new football field and a sewage-treating project they will choose the football field.

A U.S. Senate committee has reported that we must spend at least $600 million a year merely to catch up with the need for nationwide sewagetreating facilities both civil and military. To meet present deficiencies and future needs will require $1.7 billion a year until 1980 and increasing amounts after that. This is a very conservative estimate since it does not take into account the installation of separate sewers for water runoff and for domestic and industrial wastes.

One troublesome drawback to all present sewage-treating processes is the fact that even severe chemical treatments leave certain phosphorusand nitrogen-containing compounds in the effluent water. These are nutrients for aquatic life and from that point of view are looked upon with some favor by the Fish and Wildlife Division of the Department of the Interior. However beyond a certain limit they become water-despoilers. They result in such a tremendous growth of algae (microscopic water plants) that the available dissolved oxygen is used up and the water is again a dark and unhealthy mess.

An interesting positive use of reclaimed sewage waters for growing algae is in making food for animals. At Lancaster California the North American Aviation Company has harvested algae which are high in protein and fed them to chickens which thrived.

A curious instance of the indirect effect of upsetting the balance of nature by providing too much marine nutrient is the disappearance of the once lush kelp forests off the coast of Southern California. The kelp has been devoured by sea urchins ravenous pincushion-like creatures which have multiplied in unprecedented numbers as the result of the vast sewage increase from the Los Angeles Basin. Maybe we can find something that will cat the sea urchins.

Who would want to drink reclaimed sewage water? This is a foolish question because millions of people have been doing so to some degree for years. More than once a sanitary chemist has stood before a group of city fathers with a glass of reclaimed sewage water on the table and bas said “Gentlemen this is the purest water you will have ever been privileged to drink. Here have a sip!” And everybody has slunk away.

Actually a large percentage of chemically treated municipal water throughout the country has been exposed to sewage contamination. Chicago’s potable water comes from Lake Michigan for example a sink for innumerable small and large sewer systems.

A case where sewage water is directly and deliberately processed into drinking water is that of the Whittier Narrows water-reclamation plant of the Los Angeles County sanitation districts. The plant takes millions of gallons of sewage a day from an enormous area. First the solid matter is settled out in the usual primary step; it is then exposed to activated sludge and is finished off with chlorine. At this stage the California Institute of Technology can find nothing wrong with it. But even so the Whittier Narrows water does not go directly into local waterlines. Instead it is pumped into spreading basins. There it settles into the groundwater supply of the county. Diluted by the natural groundwater it is then pumped into community faucets from wells.

Pennsylvania State University is doing some research on the use of treated sewage water for irrigation. The 3-million-gallon-per-day effluent from the State College community is put through filtration aeration an activated sludge step and chlorination to remove 95 percent of the waste’s biochemical oxygen demand making it nearly pure enough to drink. It is then sprinkled through special nonfreezing spray heads to replenish groundwater supplies in the area. Percolation through the soil results in removal of 99 percent of the phosphorous 88 percent of the nitrogen and practically all of the detergents. The success of this kind of treatment depends on the soil. If it is too porous the percolation time is not long enough to use the soil as a treating material; if it is too impervious waterlogging will occur.

We need not only an open-minded consideration of new concepts of sewage management; we need a new way of extracting money from the citizens. Bond issues and property taxes for sewers are reaching the breaking point. One solution would be to establish sewerage as a straight utility rather than as a tiny increment added to the water bill. A house owner gladly pays $11 a month for telephone service. Why shouldn’t he pay a somewhat similar amount to have his household wastes disposed of in a thoroughly safe and foolproof manner?

HARNESSING THE WATER SUPPLY

The amount of water on earth is virtually constant; hence the problem of an ever multiplying human race is to get it in usable form and to apportion it. If we could obtain rain where we need it or could even accurately predict where and when it would fall and in what amount we would have a start. Eventually we know we are going to need the oceans both for water and for atomic power but we are now faced with the question of whether it is best to meet local scarcities by desalting seawater or by impounding and transporting the huge reserves of fresh water going to waste in subarctic rivers. In the meantime the challenge of rainmaking has nagged us especially over the past 20 years and we are beginning to realize that one reason for our notable lack of a breakthrough in this field is that we don’t know enough about the weather. There are too many things about the process of rainfall that we don’t understand.

Tropical storms — and in fact all rainstorms — are nature’s way of desalting seawater. The great water cycle — evaporation from the oceans leaving the salt behind; rain; runoff to rivers with huge intermediate losses to the air by evaporation from the soil from lakes and ponds and by transpiration of plants — has turned out to be a most untidy way to run a planet occupied by 3 billion human beings whose demand for sweet water is insatiable. We usually get too much or too little at the wrong time. This is a fault of nature but it is our own fault that we waste such appalling amounts of fresh water chiefly by evaporation from irrigation canals and reservoirs.

Over the past several years an unexpected strategy developed by chemists shows promise for cutting down these evaporation losses. The trick is to add to the water traces of harmless surfactant compounds such as the higher alcohols which form molecular layers on the surface of quiet lakes or ditches and reduce the rate of evaporation by creating a micro-thin barrier through which the water molecules find it hard to escape into the air. This technique does not work so well in large windswept bodies of water since waves break the surface film. Results have been promising in Australia and in our Southwest in certain large-scale experiments. Improvements in chemically anchoring the film so that it is less easily ruptured are being studied though the high cost of the necessary chemicals is discouraging.

Most of the present costs of water especially as made available to the irrigation farmer are wholly deceptive. Such a farmer claims he will be ruined if water costs him more than one cent per thousand gallons. He usually gets it at that price but it is a gift from the taxpayers pure and simple. The farmer pays nothing on the amortizations of large dams and reservoir construction for which a considerable part of the expenditures consists in locating the impoundments or the conduits at such levels that gravity can deliver the water to his crops. Having one-cent water the farmer wastes it in leaking ditches and in excessive irrigation runs.

If we continue to evaluate irrigation water at the absurd price of one cent per 1000 gallons no method of desalting seawater or even of large-scale transportation of water such as the North American Water and Power Alliance (NAWAPA) plan for bringing the excess water of the Northwestern rivers of the continent to 33 states of the Union to Mexico and to Canada will be worth considering for irrigation. Pumping charges would make the price soar. We are up against social and political barbed wire packed with high voltage which may fence us in against considering any great continental water enterprises.

WATER FROM THE SEA

Critics of the desalinization program of the federal government have been quick to point out that even if water were available from the oceans at prices lower than what coastal cities now pay for water from other sources desalted seawater would still cost 10 to 15 times too much for the Utah or Arizona farmer. This point is important since among large water users it is only the irrigating farmer who actually consumes water. Industry and municipalities borrow water and dirty it but they do not consume it to any really significant extent. One can easily conceive of water-purification systems which would operate on sewage water and end the water shortage for industry and municipalities. Here the major problem is pollution which creates a scarcity of clean water. It is the farmer who cannot recover the water which his plants release or his soil evaporates who would in the long run benefit from desalinization of seawater on a gigantic scale but it is precisely the farmer who cannot afford such desalted water.

Before we decide whether such vast projects as desalinization plants powered by nuclear energy or NAWAPA are practicable we are going to have to concede that they will saddle the city taxpayer with a colossal burden of paying for farm benefits. Since the city taxpayer is already making good the difference between one-cent-per-1000-gallon water to the irrigator and a realistic cost of 5 or 10 times as much he may hesitate to make it a multiple of 30 or 40. In the meantime however as security against local droughts and as a substitute for much more stringent antipollution measures the city man is interested in desalinization.

In general for large installations some form of distillation seems to be the answer and where power can be sold and mineral by-products can find a market the heat of distillation may best be provided by atomic fission. For smaller plants operating on water of lower salt content than seawater the electrodialysis process in which salt is forced out of brackish water electrically through plasticmembranes is moving ahead fast and competes with the “reverse-osmosis” technique in which a separating membrane is also used but high pressure instead of electricity is the motive force.

President Johnson in justifying the research and development money he wants spent by the Office of Saline Water in the Department of the Interior ($29 million in fiscal 1966) has said we need new ideas. There is no paucity of them. The OSW now screens about 400 proposals a year.

None of the current approaches seems capable of making potable water at less than one dollar per 1000 gallons. City water in the United States now averages from 10 to 35 cents per 1000 gallons. However there are communities in this country and abroad that would think the dollar price a bargain. At least 1000 towns in the United States have to use water containing up to one percent salt. Seawater contains 3.5 percent salt.

Although many processes are being studied two dramatic changes in our ways of thinking about water desalinization have changed the pace and direction of development. One is the favorable theoretical economics of very large combined nuclear-energy and desalting plants. The second (and perhaps more important) is the concept of applying such a process to reclaim mixtures of sewage water and seawater or of sewage water alone. This may lead to an effective solution of the water-pollution problems of big coastal river or lake cities.

The importance of this notion is suggested by the vigorous counterattacks it has provoked from the coal industry which fears that coal may be dislodged from its last precious stronghold as a fuel in electric power plants. The National Coal Association the National Coal Policy Conference and the United Mine Workers write passionate letters to the President claiming with eloquence and bitterness that the nuclear processes involve government subsidies in the form of artificially low prices for nuclear fuels; that they may blow up New York City; and that even if they are successful they would put 5 men out of work for every man they put in a job since production of heat from coal provides about 5 times as many jobs as the production of the same amount of heat from nuclear fuel. In this last point they are undoubtedly right and indeed it is probably the strongest economical justification for nuclear processes.

If it were not for their manpower savings one might be suspicious of the correctness of estimated power costs from nuclear plants since the Atomic Energy Commission makes it very hard to find out just what nuclear fuels do cost. Some utility companies such as Consolidated Edison Company which has operated a nuclear power plant at Indian Point just below Peekskill New York maintain that the burning of uranium costs 22 cents a million British thermal units of heat energy produced while by comparison coal costs 29 cents fuel oils 33 cents and gas more than 40 cents. The Con Ed people think that uranium will be under the 20 cents mark in a few years.

This is for electric power. The dramatic aspect of these figures applied to water treatment has come out in the recent proposal of the Bechtel Corporation for a 150-million-gallon-per-day desalting operation for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. If electric power is produced at the same time from part of the steam evolved by nuclear heating and this power is sold at 4 mills per kilowatt-hour a going rate in the area Bechtel shows that the cost of water can be as low as 22 cents per thousand gallons. To match the 150 million gallons of water 1800 megawatts of power would be distributed which is enough for a city with a population of 2 million and is considerably more than the hydroelectric power yielded at Hoover Dam.

A week after the Bechtel study contract was signed San Diego had an earthquake. Evidently to quell superstitious fears of earth tremors releasing a mushroom cloud Bechtel recommended that the desalinization electric power plant be located on an artificial island offshore from Sunset Beach.

The Bechtel prospectus has naturally been closely examined by its enemies as well as its friends. There seems every likelihood that it will go through and that by the middle 1970s Southern California will have fresh water from the sea in enough volume to supply a city of 750000 about one sixth of the population of Los Angeles. This would be 50 times larger than the biggest current desalting operation which is located in the Caribbean island of Aruba and is run by Shell Oil Company. There is some doubt that the water from the Feather River Valley in Northern California which will start flowing southward in the 1970s will cost any less since over 400 miles of transportation are involved and pumping costs are usually estimated at 10 cents per thousand gallons per 100 miles. This water has to be pumped over the Tehachapi Mountains which separate Northern from Southern California. The Atomic Energy Commission has agreed to help California build a nuclear power plant to do this pumping job more cheaply.

In the meantime the state of New York rendered unbearably restless by its awful pollution troubles and a long drought decided to sign up with American Machine & Foundry Company for a small nuclear plant at Riverhead on the northeast shore of Long Island to turn out a million gallons of desalted water a day (enough for the needs of 10000 rural people) as well as 2500 kilowatts of electricity per hour and up to 500000 curies of cobalt 60 isotope a year. The latter is a new idea and may show some profit for plants of this size since cobalt 60 is in demand the world over for miniature power packages and for scientific use. For much larger plants the by-products could be minerals from the sea including chlorine sodium magnesium calcium potassium bromine boron and even silver and gold. Phosphate fertilizers could be produced as shown by W. R. Grace & Company by pretreatment of seawater with phosphoric acid. This would also reduce the scaling-up of evaporators with magnesium and calcium salts.

When the combination nuclear plants are applied to mixtures of sewage water and seawater a distillation residue of considerable complexity will result. Some decomposition of organic material might take place with the possibility of creating an air-pollution nuisance. However the use of standard chemical absorbers and auxiliary treatment of the overhead water would probably still make the total cost of producing clean water from such a witches’ brew reasonable in comparison with the present clumsy methods of sewage handling. The greatest virtue of such total treatment is that it would eliminate the hideously complicated murk of thousands of trace chemical pollutants which we suspect will otherwise haunt the lives of those living in our river and lake cities from now on. The use of nuclear power would also eliminate a large fraction of the air pollution which now comes from the burning of coal or fuel oil for electric power production.

Desalting of seawater involves an embarrassing problem that has not been entirely solved: What do you do with all the salt obtained as a by-product? In plants designed to furnish drinking water to a large city the sodium chloride residue would be huge. The only answer seems to be to pump the hot concentrated brine back into the ocean hoping that it will disperse fast enough so that it does not build up in the processing cycle and that it does not unduly pollute the continental-shelf marine habitat the most productive part of the ocean as far as salt-water fish are concerned. Probably there is more danger to the fish from the by-product heat than from excess salt. These questions need to be answered to be sure that we would not be replacing one form of water pollution with another.

RETHINKING THE PROBLEM OF COST

In considering grand programs such as a series of half-a-billion-gallon-per-day desalting plants or the colossal movement of waters such as proposed in the NAWAPA project we must develop a new philosophy of costs. The NAWAPA concept was proposed by the Ralph M. Parsons Company and has been introduced to the Senate Public Works Committee by Senator Frank E. Moss of Utah. The enormous amount of water running uselessly into the sea from Alaska Canada and the Northwestern United States would be collected and stored in an intercontinental system of reservoirs at relatively high elevations. By means of a reservoir-canal-river system the water would then be redistributed throughout the continent from Canada to Mexico generating power as it descended into the sea.

NAWAPA could provide 36 trillion gallons per year enough to irrigate 40 million acres of land in our Western states (more than is now being irrigated) and yield 100 million kilowatts of electric power equivalent to 75 Hoover Dams. It would bring the Great Lakes back to their normal level increase the output of Niagara Falls and open up a navigable canal from the St. Lawrence River to the Pacific Ocean. It would cost about $100 billion and take 20 years to complete.

NAWAPA is by far the biggest public works project ever considered. However it contains internal defects that should oblige us to reflect on our whole continental philosophy of water. NAWAPA would double our irrigation water supply but do we want more irrigated land? It would create a “Northwest passage” but what good is that? It would give Mexico the equivalent of an Aswan Dam but are we in the business of growing Mexican cotton? It would make the Great Lakes deeper but is that a good way to solve the sickening pollution of Lake Erie and Lake Michigan?

In a sense NAWAPA is an agricultural pork barrel for the farmers of three countries. It is based on the erroneous premise that we have a basic water shortage in most of North America. In fact we have a shortage only of clean water. Building a big dam and a reservoir for flushing purposes is one way to try to clean up a river. (The Army Corps of Engineers proposed it for the Potomac.) But it is a very inefficient and very expensive way to cope with pollution. It would not solve for example one of our most critical poison-water dilemmas — how to remove trace quantities of dangerous organic chemical wastes. There is another defect in this method of getting more clean water: storage dams represent essentially an irreversible action committed upon a river. The river is tied in chains. If you decide later you must treat the river water instead of diluting it you have already built your monument of concrete and must pay the interest on it. Acreage has been inundated.

For several decades the storage-dam concept has been fiercely defended by the sacred cliché that “electricity makes low-cost water possible.” This is certainly true where the electric power source is reasonably close to a large market for power as would be the case with nuclear desalting plants in coastal cities. But the easy hydroelectric dam sites are used up and it costs a good deal of money to transport electric power. The claim of the Reclamation Bureau that the taxpayers get reimbursed (except for costs that are written off against nonreimbursable aspects such as flood control or recreation) from profits on power has been disputed by modern economists. Some funny bookkeeping is involved since the Reclamation Bureau pays low interest well below the government’s rate on new bond issues. The NAWAPA scheme however would go a long way toward curing the pollution problem in the United States by installing proper sewage and industrial waste-treating facilities.

MEN WHO HAVE TRIED

In the field of water pollution there are probably no two more knowledgeable men in the country including all scientific as well as practical elements of know-how than Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine and Representative John Blatnik of Minnesota. Senator Muskie knows the problem as exgovernor of his native state and he knows how penny-pinching can block action. For example in his own town of Waterville a local sewer district was established; it issued revenue bonds completely rebuilt the city sewers cleaned up the tributary streams but found that because of the authorized debt limit there was no money left for sewage treatment.

The device of forming districts or “authorities” of several communities to evade the debt limit was invented by a Waterville lawyer and the idea spread over the country but this did not help lonely Waterville. On the other hand Allegheny County in Pennsylvania contracted for a $100 million sewage treating system to service 125 communities created the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority and issued revenue bonds; and every three months the Allegheny County homeowner gets a bill prorated on his water bill.

Edmund Muskie understands the terrifying rocky stubbornness of New England which would rather decay than spend money. He knows the story of the Merrimack River one of the dirtiest stretches of water in the history of the world. But the political history of the Merrimack is even grimier. Although the Merrimack’s pollution has been bemoaned for 80 years not one town on the main stem of the river has treated its sewage.

The Merrimack psychosis is the reason we need federal action. Until 1945 the Massachusetts Department of Public Health had no enforcement powers and could make only pallid recommendations to the legislature. But even the present control law has no teeth nor any provision for improvement grants. The Merrimack Valley is a depressed area and the textile industries that did not flee to the South let it be known that sewer rates would break their straining backs. Bond issues for sewage treatment were defeated by incredible margins: 5 to 1 in Haverhill and 7 to 1 in Lowell. Even the U.S. Public Health Service got itself involved in a scandal when it was revealed that one of its officials had promised the Massachusetts authorities that federal enforcement would not be initiated. In 1963 Governor Endicott Peabody requested federal help but the Public Health Service was refused data by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health which would not name any industrial polluters. In a public hearing an official of the state Public Health department became so insulting to federal representatives that the meeting ended in a donnybrook. A basic trouble is that the people are not willing to pay a reasonable price for fresh water. They have a vague notion that water should be free like air. Local water boards won’t charge higher prices to pay for water or sewage treatment because as the citizens along the Merrimack have shown at the polls the members of the water boards would promptly lose their jobs.

The Public Health Service had even less luck in New Jersey in the case of Raritan Bay. Here the details of the failure to act appear to have been hushed up but such men as Representative John Dingell of Michigan have pointed out that every federal agency involved showed dereliction: the Public Health Service because contamination which infected shellfish was being put into the bay; the Coast Guard because they failed to restrict pumping of oil into the bay waters; and even the Army Corps of Engineers because the Flood Control Act of 1899 gives them responsibility to take action when dangerous substances are being inserted into water. No attempt was made according to Dingell to control even the pumping of sewage from federal installations into this gray lagoon.

Interstate commissioners have claimed preposterously that the Arthur Kill is immaculate as far as Raritan Bay is concerned. Humble Oil Company American Cyanamid and General Aniline & Film have been dumping organic wastes from Arthur Kill into the bay for decades; and eight and a half years after formal objection had elicited from the state of New Jersey only a mild scolding Representative Dingell was so fed up with lack of action by the U.S. Public Health Service that he demanded that the function of federal water-pollution policing be transferred from the Department of Health Education and Welfare to the Department of the Interior.

Up to now the U.S. Public Health Service has legally been empowered to act only in cases involving interstate waters or at the invitation of the governor of a single state. But the Public Health Service has not been aggressive. The water-pollution authority is buried under layers of bureaucracy reporting ultimately to the Surgeon General. Organized like the Army the Public Health Service has a strong esprit de corps and a great desire not to make any enemies. In such cases as Raritan Bay it has acted with all the resoluteness of a wet noodle.

Both the House and the Senate heartily supported transferring authority from the U.S. Public Health Service to a new Federal Water Pollution Control Administration headed by an assistant secretary of the Department of Health Education and Welfare. In the Water Pollution Act of 1965 the House and Senate agreed on increased grants for sewer projects grants for water-pollution research and a general stiffening of the federal backbone. Will the Water Pollution Act do the job? Not unless it is adequately financed. President Johnson has asked for $50 million for a start on a program that might cost $10 billion over the next decade.

Without at least this much money the act will not accomplish what must be accomplished. It may prevent some future outright horrors such as Raritan Bay and conceivably even clean up the Merrimack River but it is not going to achieve the President’s goal of “preventing pollution before it happens.” It does not propose any really basic remedy for industrial pollution such as President Johnson’s suggestion of a “user fee” similar to the brilliantly successful system used in West Germany. It does not tie together a great national water reuse program with large-scale elimination of all types of pollution. It proposes a police action rather than a really concerted plan. It would add policemen but not planning engineers.

What must somehow be pounded into the heads of the people who govern us is that as far as the eye can see into the future our big problem in water is pollution. The problem of water shortages is a problem of treating dirty water whether the dirt is in the form of municipal sewage industrial waste salt or silt.

The difficulty is that dealing with pollution — in the broad sense involving for instance soil erosion and salt invasion of groundwaters as well as the more obvious and smelly modes of degrading fresh water — necessitates stepping on innumerable toes outside of a particular federal department. The more rationally James M. Quigley Assistant Secretary of Health Education and Welfare and Commissioner of the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration approaches his enormous job the more hisses and catcalls he will get. Even the hitherto mild and spiritless activities of the Public Health Service have caused tantrums of rage among the states among industrialists and among other federal departments.

Because of its polite remonstrances the HEW Department has been accused of a ravening will to power. If Mr. Quigley attempts to promote what is the most promising solution to urban water problems — the combined reclamation of sewage water and seawater (for example the reclamation of the Hudson River which would end New York City’s prolonged agony) — he will be regarded as a veritable demon. A demon is precisely what we need if the President will stand behind him. We need a man tough as an old saddle and fearless as a wolverine.

An alternative to one-department planning on a grand scale has always been a “council” or a committee. (One recalls the old definition of a camel — a horse designed by a committee.) In 1943 the Federal Inter-Agency River Basin Committee (“Firebrick”) was created to encourage cooperation between the Army Corps of Engineers and the Departments of Agriculture and of the Interior in studies of multiple-purpose dams. The members sat on their hands. The Corps and the Reclamation Bureau went ahead building dams as they saw fit and the Soil Conservation people continued their same tours of duty. In 1964 a Federal Inter-Agency Committee on Water Resources (“Icewater”) was set up consisting of representatives of Interior Agriculture Commerce HEW and the Federal Power Commission. These men have harrumphed and yawned suspiciously at each other but we still have no overall resources policy.

There is no agency in the federal government authorized to determine the policies make the decisions and give the supervision required for water resources development; and in the area of pollution which underlies water resources there is not even a shadow of such authority. The 1965 model was the Water Resources Council headed by the Secretary of the Interior and reporting directly to the President. This was a body hastily drafted to give the thirsting voters of the Northeast an impression that their troubles would be ended by virtue of a series of powwows. It shows no signs of establishing before the public the fact that pollution and water reuse are matters of driving urgency.

In the New York predicament the state has shown more insight than the federal government. Governor Rockefeller’s $1.7 billion program for abatement of water pollution if coupled with reduction of losses and installation of full water metering (New York City loses twice as much water in its transmission system — 400 million gallons a day — as the city of Boston uses) would go further to relieve the local famine than such airily conceived notions as diverting water from Canada. The plan to use salt water to fight fires in New York City will help.

Unfortunately the majority of the people and even a majority of the Congress still do not understand the gravity of our water-pollution problems. Cleaning up the rivers is viewed by many as part of the “beautification” program like getting the automobile junk piles out of sight. Improving the scenery docs not purge the water. In my opinion the League of Women Voters is doing the best job countrywide in educating people to the importance of the water problem. It has placed water pollution high on its list of “continuing responsibilities.”

To implement the mighty efforts needed in water reuse desalting and soil control we need a crash program exceeding the magnitude and pace of the Manhattan Project which developed the nuclear bomb. This is especially true in the research and development aspects of antipollution. Some tremendous gaps in our knowledge and know-how exist which must be filled by an immense acceleration of research.

As a professional chemist I cannot resist the temptation to point out one promising approach to the problem of organic chemical pollution which is receiving no federal money at all. This is the development of strains of bacteria or ferments that would selectively digest the trace poisons in industrial effluents. Private chemical and petroleum industries are working along such lines for their own purposes. Standard Oil of New Jersey for example has developed a microbiological process for converting petroleum into food. There are known strains of microflora that will selectively chew the wax out of crude oil or will chew the sulfur out of it. Dow Chemical Company uses selected bacteria to destroy phenolic chemical wastes. Maybe there are bugs that could be grown which would even thrive on minute but still toxic concentrations of endrin DDT and the other pesticides that are killing our fish and probably degrading our own livers. There could certainly be developed special microbic scavengers that would do a faster and better job in our sewage plants.

Research work of this kind needs to be done intensively and patiently with astronomical numbers of time-consuming experiments. And yet to my knowledge no system of experiments has been started with the specific goal in mind of controlling water pollution. We leave it to nature to provide the bacteria for sewage treatment but nature is not a sanitary engineer and nature is a great believer in time. Time however is of the essence. We run all kinds of races against disaster. Certainly not the least of these is the race against disease and ugliness — the race to clean up our once sweet waters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOS91cy93aWxkZmlyZS1wb2xsdXRpb24td2F0ZXItcXVhbGl0eS1kcm91Z2h0LWNsaW1hdGUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBVmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDUvMjkvdXMvd2lsZGZpcmUtcG9sbHV0aW9uLXdhdGVyLXF1YWxpdHktZHJvdWdodC1jbGltYXRl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disaster upon disaster: Wildfires are contaminating the West's depleting water with ashy sludge,"CNN —

Officials in Las Vegas New Mexico had barely finished battling the massive Calf Canyon-Hermits Peak wildfire earlier this month before they had to point their defenses toward another threat: the ash-filled erosion that could pollute their water.

The fire-scarred land along the banks of the Gallinas River is on the forefront of Mayor Louie Trujillo’s mind these days. As much as the parched West needs rain Trujillo and other officials are racing the weather to divert precious river water into a downstream lake before downpour comes and washes the burnt topsoil and ash into the river.

“There are large portions of the watershed you can see that are completely burned. It looks like burnt toothpicks sticking out of the ground for acres and acres” Trujillo told CNN. “With the soil instability during a heavy rain event it would be like putting water on a bunch of baby powder where it doesn’t absorb at all; it just falls. We hope to beat the monsoon season doing some of the interventions we’re going to have to do along the watershed.”

Megafires aren’t just burning down homes trees and wildlife in the West. They’re also destabilizing the soil. When it rains thousands of tons of charred sediment flow into rivers and reservoirs used for drinking water. The Gallinas River for example supplies about 90 percent of the water for Las Vegas.

“It’s literally like tasting dirt” said Andy Fecko general manager at the Placer County Water Agency in Auburn California a city that sits between Sacramento and Lake Tahoe.

“It adds a tremendous amount of treatment costs” Fecko told CNN. “You’re trying to filter out water that’s 10 to 20 times dirtier.”

Even if they can filter out the taste of dirt and ash water treatment managers also worry about the lingering impacts of charred organic compounds mixing with the chlorine used to purify the water so it’s drinkable. The Environmental Protection Agency has warned about the health impacts of mixing the two.

All of this is adding more stress to water resources that are already depleting in the West’s megadrought. Conservationists and officials are sounding the alarm about yet another impact of a warming climate massive wildfires and fragile water resources.

“This is not our first megadrought so we have to make really good use of every drop of water that we store” said Dan Porter forest program director for the Nature Conservancy. “These megafires are making that very difficult to do.”

The taste of sludge

In September 2014 California’s King Fire ripped through over 100000 acres in El Dorado County. That fire was relatively small by the standards of other megafires but it burned very hot.

It was “a blast furnace of an event that obliterated everything in its path” Fecko told CNN. “It was nuclear winter up there after that event.”

The fire was just the first problem. The following rainy season more than 300000 tons of ashy topsoil sludge ended up in the Rubicon River – normally pristine water that flows out of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

The huge sediment dump caused headaches for Fecko’s water agency on two fronts he said. First was the impact to their hydroelectric power operations which clogged up with dirt that made it tough to run the water through to generate electricity. The second was drinking water.

“You simply cannot filter out the taste and odor” Fecko said likening the taste and smell to the earthy smell after it rains. And he said the added sediment doubled the cost of water treatment at his facility necessitating water filters to be changed out more often.

It can take years for that taste and smell to go away. That period only gets longer in the middle of a megadrought.

“It’s essentially these micro-organics you can’t filter out it’s so small” Fecko said.

And while humans have water filtration wildlife does not. Researchers at the University of California Davis captured photos of frog eggs after the sediment dump; they were covered by fine ashy dirt which blocks the eggs from getting oxygen.

“They rely on clean well-oxygenated water” Porter said. “When the wildfire chocks the stream full of mud the oxygen-holding capacity of the water is reduced. It clogs gills; it clogs egg sacs.”

With an 8-year restoration project conducted by Fecko’s water agency the US Forest Service the Nature Conservancy and other partners still ongoing conservationists are hopeful the frog population has recovered. But even with close to a decade restoring the landscape sediment still shows up in hydropower bays Fecko said.

A potential carcinogen

Those micro-organic compounds that give water a funny taste and smell after fire-caused erosion are worrying for another reason.

When organic compounds from the ash interact with the chlorine used to treat water it can form byproducts that can act as carcinogens – things that can cause cancer – with long-term exposure. It’s another aspect of this problem that scientists and water quality managers are studying.

“It’s tasteless you can’t see it but what the EPA has identified is long-term exposure to these disinfection byproducts chronic exposure can actually be a carcinogen” said Dan Corcoran director of operations at the El Dorado Irrigation District in Placerville California. “It’s a nationwide issue and it’s an evolving science.”

Corcoran’s water district had to deal with this problem after last year’s massive Caldor Fire torched the landscape in August. In October the area was hit with an atmospheric river rain event that caused massive flooding and erosion.

“We went from drought to flood management literally overnight” Corcoran said describing a “wall of water” blackened by ash and filled with dead trees and debris flowing through the watershed.

Restoration projects in fire-scarred areas are ongoing and include prescribed burns and thinning to ensure the next fire isn’t so catastrophic and doesn’t pose as much of a challenge to rivers and reservoirs.

But there’s also an education campaign for policymakers and residents about the threat wildfires pose to their drinking water.

“Seventy-one percent of the entire state of California drinks water that comes out of the Sierra Nevada” Corcoran said. “Three-quarters of the people who live in our state should be concerned with how our headwaters are managed.”

And with climate change exacerbating drought conditions in California and causing snow-melt water to run down weeks ahead of schedule water officials and conservationists are warning of even more unpredictability ahead.

“I don’t think people really understand the severity of the threat to the overall system of water management across California and across the West” said Porter. “We’re facing a climate-driven set of processes that we don’t have full control over.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc2pybmV3cy5jb20vbmF0aXZlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWlzc3Vlcy1zYW4tanVhbi1jb3VudHktYmx1ZmYtbWV4aWNhbi1oYXQtbW9udGV6dW1hLWNyZWVrLWFuZXRoLW1vbnVtZW50LXZhbGxledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Signing finalizes massive Navajo Utah water rights settlement,"by David Boyle

News Director

The execution of the Utah Navajo Water Rights Settlement was completed with a signing of state federal and tribal leaders in Monument Valley on May 27.

The agreement concluded 18 years of negotiations between the parties and affirms water rights of Utah Navajos as well as over $200 million for water infrastructure in the Utah portion of the Navajo Nation.

The settlement recognizes a reserved water right of 81500 acre-feet of water annually for current and future use by the Navajo Nation in the state of Utah.

The agreement also allows the Nation to lease water shares.

The allocation comes from the Utah apportionment of the Colorado River basin which includes tributaries meaning likely most of that allocation will be taken from the San Juan River.

As part of the settlement the federal government will pay the Navajo Nation over $210 million and the state of Utah will contribute $8 million toward drinking water infrastructure on the Navajo Nation.

Signing the agreement on May 27 was Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez Utah Governor Spencer Cox and US Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland.

About 100 people were in attendance at the event including community members tribal state and federal leaders including Utah Senator Mitt Romney.

Speaking at the event Senator Romney said not long after being sworn in as Utah Senator in 2018 he was approached by President Nez who explained the history of the controversy.

“For many many years there was a question about who had the rights to the water that flows through the Navajo Nation. As you can imagine people had different points of view. President Nez said we’ve come together and negotiated a settlement but we can’t get the federal government to make a final decision and to honor the agreement that we have amongst our people so we’re expecting you to get this done.”

Romney worked with former Senator Orrin Hatch as well as Representative John Curtis on the congressional act which passed in December of 2020.

Although the act had passed appropriation of the $210 million was still needed. As part of his work on the bi-partisan $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investments and Job Act Romney worked to include funds for the settlement act as well as funds for other water infrastructure projects on tribal lands.

Romney shared that he was recently asked what Utah got out of the settlement.

“Well what Utah got out of it is the Navajos of Utah who are citizens of our great country are going to get running water that’s what Utah got out of it. Of course we were also able to resolve something which could’ve involved the courts and millions of dollars of lawsuits needlessly.”

Romney was draped with a Pendleton blanket by members of the Navajo Nation Council following his remarks.

President Jonathan Nez also spoke at the event about what the settlement would mean for the constituents of the eight chapters located in Utah.

“These communities located in this area of Utah have been at the forefront of water insecurity and have managed to endure years of lack of access to clean running water. There are more than several hundred homes in the Navajo Utah region that do not have piped water infrastructure.”

Nez added that the issue is not unique to the Utah Navajo area but includes the rest of the Navajo Nation and much of Indian country in the US. The challenge of not having access to clean running water has been made more evident during a pandemic as well as historic drought.

“There are significant water quality challenges in Navajo Utah communities namely elevated uranium and arsenic in ground water. Accessing surface water is an opportunity to provide water security for the largest land based and populated tribe in the United States.”

Nez noted the agreement was an important step for continued work to secure water rights on tribal lands.

“We know that access to clean water is a basic human right. It is a necessity that was secured for us by our leaders in our treaties and was pledged to be protected for us by agents of the United States Government. We are happy to see this promise being honored.”

Governor Spencer Cox shared words from years ago when he testified before congress regarding the settlement.

“We have committed to use negotiation rather than litigation as our preferred method of resolving reserved right claims. Such negotiations require commitment patience and trust. We’ve developed a high level of trust with the Navajo Nation as we work together to develop a reasonable and equitable resolution of water rights claims for the portion of the Navajo Nation located within Utah’s borders.”

Cox also shared that the settlement was a show of how governmental entities can work together to resolve issues.

“We are better when we collaborate and we work together. Surely we have proven that commitment patience and trust can overcome any disagreements that we have.”

US Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland recalled her own childhood hauling water at her grandparents before they were able to get running water in 1995.

“There’s no reason that in 2022 every community should still be facing these types of challenges and yet only half of the households on the Navajo Nation in Utah have indoor plumbing those without indoor plumbing must haul water some as far away as 50 miles roundtrip from Halchita to Monument Valley. All the while the landscape here is primarily a desert receiving roughly only 7 inches of precipitation per year. For too long these poor water infrastructure conditions have burdened this community but today we hopefully begin to turn those challenges around.”

Haaland added that modern water infrastructure is crucial for healthcare economic opportunities and responding to the effects of climate change.

“We are taking a significant step forward in our efforts to ensure that everyone no matter where they live has access to adequate water infrastructure that is designed for the 21st century.”

Also speaking at the event was Utah Lt. Governor Deidre Henderson and Navajo Nation Vice President Myron Lizer.

Assistant Attorney General for the Navajo Nation Department of Justice Michelle Brown-Yazzie was master of ceremony for the event. Hatááłii Avery Denny provided the opening and closing prayers.

Among those in attendance at the event were elected officials from throughout Utah and the Navajo Nation.

San Juan County area representatives State Senator David Hinkins and House Representative Phil Lyman were in attendance. Navajo Nation Council Delegates who represent Utah Chapters including Herman Daniels Jr. and Charlaine Tso were in attendance. As well as local leaders San Juan County Commissioners Bruce Adams and Willie Grayeyes and Oljato chapter president Willis Begaye.

Dozens of other current and former elected officials community members were in attendance and were thanked for their work on the settlement during the event.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2JlYWNobWV0cm8uY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMjgvci1jLWhhcnJpcy13YXRlci10cmVhdG1lbnQtcGxhbnQtYW1vbmctbGFuZG1hcmtzLXJlc2lkZW50cy1jYW4tdG91ci1kdXJpbmctb3Blbi1kb29ycy10b3JvbnRvLXRoaXMtd2Vla2VuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant among landmarks residents can tour during Open Doors Toronto this weekend ...,"A view of the south side of the R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant on Queen Street East. Beach Metro Community News file photo.

Area residents will have the opportunity to visit some local landmarks during the Open Doors Toronto event taking place this weekend.

Open Doors Toronto goes Saturday May 28 and Sunday May 29. Across the city there will be more than 100 buildings and sites opened up for members of the public to get a closer look at for free.

In East Toronto Open Doors locations for this weekend are the R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant the Glen Rhodes Campus (formerly known as Glen Rhodes United Church) Todmorden Mills St. Matthew’s Anglican Church and the City of Toronto’s 433 Eastern Yard.

R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant – The iconic water treatment plan on Queen Street East at the foot of Victoria Park Avenue is well-known to most residents and is always a popular Open Doors location.

The plant will be open for visitors to take self-guided tours from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday of this weekend. The last admittance will be at 3:30 p.m. on each day. Plant staff will be on hand to answer questions. Visitors are advised that there can be a lot of walking and stairs between the buildings.

The R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant was constructed in the 1930s and is the largest of the City of Toronto’s four water treatment plants. It provides an average of 400 million litres of safe drinking water to residents in Toronto and York Region each day.

According to Open Doors Toronto: “Dubbed ‘The Palace of Purification’ the R.C. Harris was commissioned by Roland Caldwell Harris Toronto’s first and longest-serving Public Works Commissioner as a water showcase to highlight the routine and essential function needed to make cities possible.

“The R. C. Harris is the largest ensemble of Art Deco buildings in Toronto providing an excellent example of how Art Deco style can integrate with Late Romanesque Revival and Modern Classical forms.The plant is designated under the Ontario Heritage Act as a National Historic Civil Engineering Site and has been recognized as a Canadian Water Landmark by the American Water Works Association.”

Todmorden Mills – Located at 67 Pottery Rd. in the Don Valley this site will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday. Last admission will be 4 p.m.

Visitors will be able to explore the history of Todmorden Mills and the surrounding Don Valley and the Wildflower Preserve. There will be outdoor games and family crafts and those attending can also visit the Papermill Gallery to view the art of the Toronto Watercolour Society and the Awakenings video series created by Indigenous Black and artists of colour at Toronto History Museums.

According to Open Doors Toronto: “Located in the scenic Don River Valley Todmorden Mills is a cross-section of Toronto stacked century by century and layer by layer upon itself. From an Indigenous waterway to an industrial hub to a modern arts and theatre centre each community has left its mark and added another layer to explore.

“The site is home to a collection of 19th-century industrial and domestic buildings ranging from a paper mill which houses the Papermill Gallery and Theatre a former brewery two restored period homes and a Wildflower Preserve. Todmorden Mills allows visitors to immerse themselves in Toronto’s history through the daily lives of the working people who made the lumber flour beer and bricks that built our city.”

Glen Rhodes Campus – The site of Glen Rhodes United Church at 1470 Gerrard St. E. just west of Coxwell Avenue at Rhodes Avenue the campus will be open for tours. The church was constructed in 1925 in the Art Deco style.

It will be open for visitors from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday with last admissions at 4:30 p.m.

The visitor experience at the campus is described as “Take a look inside the Glen Rhodes Campus as a newly remodeled Community Hub. Volunteers posted around the building will be happy to answer any questions you may have and share with you what the Neighbourhood Food Hub has done to make the space accessible for community food groups. Follow along on our guided tours every hour starting at 10:30 am to learn more about the history of the building and the renewal of the space. Take a look inside our Community Microgreens Farm and see what’s growing this week.”

St. Matthew’s Anglican Church – Located at 135 First Avenue north of Dundas Avenue and west of Logan Avenue the church has been a central part of the Riverdale neighbourhood since 1874.

“The interior roof is an open timbered one with six principals fitted with tracing and curved braces with the rafters exposed. The screen separating the choir from the nave is a beautiful example of carved oak work in later Gothic. Over the years the church windows have been fitted with an imposing array of stained glass by the firm of Luxfer including a great memorial east window dedicated to those who died in World War I” according to Open Doors Toronto.

The church will be open Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. with last admission at 4:30 p.m.; and it will be open on Sunday from 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. with last admission at 3:30 p.m.

City of Toronto’s 433 Eastern Yard – This city facility is located at 433 Eastern Ave. between Logan Avenue and McGee. The facility was constructed in 1912 as part of the Consumers Gas Corporation complex. The complex consisted of three buildings two of which are now buildings A and B of 433 Eastern Avenue and are now owned by the City of Toronto. The third building 415 Eastern Ave. is owned by Enbridge Gas.

It will be open Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. with last admissions at 4:30 p.m.

Open Doors Toronto: “Visitors can take part in learning about activities and services that the Transportation Division provides as we build and maintain a resilient transportation network so that people connect with the places activities and communities they value. The yard doors will be open to showcase traffic signs road maintenance equipment and the salt storage area.

Russia’s Most Advanced Weapons Are Shockingly Packed With ‘American Components’ — Ukrainian Intelligence,"Ukraine has revealed the use of US-made microchips in the Russian military hardware thereby raising questions about Moscow’s ability to produce the technological components.

When the Ukrainian military started dismantling Russian weapons many pieces of captured or partially destroyed equipment had an abundant use of foreign microchips particularly those manufactured in the US.

According to the list of components shared by Ukrainian Intelligence with The War Zone Ua US defense portal the chips were found inside a recovered example of the 9S932-1 a radar-equipped air defense command post vehicle that is part of the larger Barnaul-T system a Pantsir air defense system a Ka-52 “Alligator” attack helicopter and a Kh-101 (AS-23A Kodiak) cruise missile.

List Of Components

Barnaul-T is Russia’s most high-end air defense command and control subsystem within the larger integrated system for air defense of the Russian Army Marine units and Airborne forces.

The 9S932-1 is a radar-equipped reconnaissance/control module of the Barnaul-T subsystem which conducts round-the-clock reconnaissance and exercises command and control of subordinate troops and their armaments in warfare on combat positions.

This module is directly linked to units equipped with various Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) Systems including Tor-M-series (SA-15) and 9K35 Strela (SA-13) surface-to-air missile systems 9K33 Osa (SA-8) wheeled surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems 2K22 Tunguska (SA-19) tracked air defense systems and 9K333 Verba (SA-25) MANPAD systems.

The Ukrainian Intelligence said they found eight micro-chips in the communications systems of the 9S932-1 module sourced from US manufacturers like Intel Micrel Micron Technology and Atmel Corp.

The Pantsir air defense system is a well-known medium-range SAM and an anti-aircraft artillery system. The Ukrainian specialists reportedly found five US-made chips – manufactured by AMD Rochester Electronics Texas Instruments and Linear Technology – inside the direction finder of this air defense system.

The Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM) have been in the news for their unexpectedly high rate of failure in long-range attacks against Ukrainian targets. In the words of a US Defense official during a briefing in March “either they’re failing to launch or they’re failing to hit the target or they’re failing to explode on contact”.

In addition to the reportedly high failure rates the Kh-101 also appears to be heavily dependent on foreign-made chips as the Ukrainian intelligence claimed to have found at least 35 US-made chips including those manufactured by Texas Instruments Atmel Corp.

The high rate of failures and latest findings of such heavy dependence on foreign chips in Kh-101 ALCM should be concerning for Moscow as the missile’s Kh-102 variant is the Russian Air Force’s main air-launched nuclear-armed cruise missile.

Coming to the Ka-52 Alligator Russia’s twin-seat all-weather attack helicopter the Ukrainian specialists opened up its turreted electro-optical system in which they found 22 US-made chips and one Korean-made chip.

The US manufacturers included Texas Instruments IDT Altera USA Burr-Brown Analog Devices Inc. Micron Technology Linear Technology and TE Connectivity.

Chips Not Necessarily Sourced From Manufacturers

These chips may not have necessarily been sourced directly from the manufacturers as there is a massive and unregulated market for recycled chips emerging from China which could be a more likely source of these chips as many of them appear to be quite old according to Ukrainian specialists.

Also as reported earlier by EurAsian Times researchers in the UK revealed in April that Russia has been sourcing British-made dual-use components such as electronic chips and switchboards for its weaponry through intermediary businesses in India and China.

Earlier this month Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo who recently met Ukraine’s Prime Minister said during a Senate hearing “We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground it’s filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators.”

Components found in weapon systems are difficult to prevent from falling into the wrong hands but experts say that the US officials do have the authority to prevent shipments of such dual-use chips.

NATO Members Arming Russia?

The news comes after an astounding revelation in late April that how NATO members had used the ‘Grandfather Clause’ to bypass the EU embargo on Moscow.

According to an EU report at least ten NATO member states exported around €350 million ($378.6 million) in military hardware to Vladimir Putin’s regime out of which German and French companies accounted for 78 percent with €273 million ($295.4 million) worth of military export.

Despite an EU-wide embargo on arms supplies to Russia after the latter annexed Crimea in 2014 Germany and France delivered bombs rockets missiles and guns to Moscow.

In addition the French companies also delivered thermal imaging cameras as well as navigation systems for fighter aircraft attack helicopters and Russian tanks.

These member states took advantage of a loophole that allowed contracts signed before August 1 2014 or subsequent contracts that would help close those agreements to continue.

That said the latest findings have exposed the heavy dependence of Russian war machines on western technology in key sensitive areas such as targeting navigation communications and control systems of the weapons which could be deeply unsettling for Moscow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FnYWRnZXQuY29tL2VuLzEzNDUwOC1hbWVyaWNhbi1taWNyb2NoaXBzLWZvdW5kLWluLWNhcHR1cmVkLXJ1c3NpYW4tbWlsaXRhcnktZXF1aXBtZW50LWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS_SAXFodHRwczovL2dhZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9lbi8xMzQ1MDgtYW1lcmljYW4tbWljcm9jaGlwcy1mb3VuZC1pbi1jYXB0dXJlZC1ydXNzaWFuLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWVxdWlwbWVudC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American microchips found in captured Russian military equipment - intelligence,Not only Fallout: 7 series based on the plot of computer games that are also worthy of attention,,,,,,,,,

In Minnesota's strong economy choice becomes harder,"Kai Westby always assumed he would need a four-year degree to work in corporate business.

Higher Ed Fewer Learners An occasional series about how declining enrollment is reshaping higher education.

He started at Minnesota State University Mankato in fall 2020 but realized after just one semester that the traditional college path was not for him. Westby 20 left the university and soon discovered a new apprenticeship program with Aon insurance company that could also lead to his dream corporate career.

Now a year into the program Westby works for Aon while pursuing an associate degree in marketing and management at Normandale Community College. The company pays him a salary covers his tuition and is offering him a chance to move into a higher position — such as insurance specialist human resource specialist or IT analyst — once he completes his two-year apprenticeship.

""I thought about leaving four years of college and I'm like 'That's just four years with a piece of paper and a lot of debt'"" Westby said. ""But this is a great experience with absolutely no debt left behind.""

In a historically tight labor market a growing number of employers are wooing Minnesotans like Westby by eliminating four-year degree requirements for jobs and offering to train new hires themselves. Those companies in Minnesota and the U.S. are prioritizing specific skills and experience over educational background opening more careers to people without degrees and raising questions about whether a college education is as necessary as it used to be.

Kai Westby an Aon apprentice worked in a conference room at Aon's office in Bloomington. Westby prefers this to his desk due to the extra space privacy and white board access.

Minnesota colleges many of which lost 25% of their enrollment over the past decade are responding by partnering with employers and launching accelerated programs to get students into the workforce more quickly. To remain relevant they will have to convince employers and increasingly skeptical families that costly degrees are still valuable.

""Our colleges and universities should be ready to meet the workforce demand not only of today but also of the work of the future"" said Devinder Malhotra chancellor of the Minnesota State colleges and universities system.

Workers without degrees are in high demand in Minnesota. Eight of the state's top 10 in-demand occupations require only a high school diploma. And more than 40% of the roughly 206000 job vacancies in the second quarter of 2021 had no educational requirements according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development's most recent data.

Registered trade apprenticeships — only some of which require education at a technical college — have also been on the rise in Minnesota more than doubling since the late 1990s according to the state Department of Labor and Industry.

Degrees not required

In recent years some major companies have begun considering workers without college degrees for white-collar jobs if they have relevant skills and experience. Those removing four-year degree requirements say it is helping diversify their workforce and expand applicant pools.

""We're trying to bring a new group of people into the professional workforce and while we're doing it we're helping solve a talent shortage"" said Ray Longo Aon's Upper Midwest market leader who manages the company's corporate apprentice program in Minnesota.

Aon is working with Accenture and other partner companies to establish corporate apprenticeship networks in several U.S. cities including Minneapolis.

The Minnesota apprenticeship network is off to a strong start with participation from Aon Accenture economic development partnership Greater MSP and locally headquartered companies such as Best Buy and Cargill. The companies hope to collectively hire at least 1000 apprentices in the Twin Cities by 2025.

""This isn't a debate about whether a bachelor's degree is a valuable qualification in today's economy. It's a recognition that a four-year degree isn't necessary for success in many entry-level roles"" said Peter Frosch president and CEO of Greater MSP. ""Minnesota employers would be smart to be on the forefront of that change because opening hiring to more potential employees is a competitive advantage.""

Between 2017 and 2019 U.S. employers loosened college degree requirements for 46% of middle-skill jobs and 31% of high-skill occupations according to a report released this year by the Burning Glass Institute a nonprofit research center that analyzed millions of online job postings. The trend accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic researchers found and they projected a million more jobs could open to people without degrees in the next five years if employers keep lowering requirements.

Apprentices from Aon and Accenture mingled with company leaders and other invitees during a Minnesota Apprentice Network professional mixer at Aon's office in Bloomington.

More than 80 of America's largest employers — including Minnesota-based companies Best Buy Target and Medtronic — recently pledged to change their hiring and promotion practices to emphasize skills over college degrees.

Medtronic has removed college degree requirements for about 25% of its information technology jobs replacing them with skills-based criteria such as competence in certain software and technology.

Since doing so about a third of Medtronic's new hires have been people without four-year degrees and a quarter of the medical device company's promotions have gone to employees without a bachelor's degree said Amy Wilson human resources director on Medtronic's global talent acquisition team.

""It's highlighting for us that we are having the impact that we are considering and hiring talent that wouldn't have otherwise been considered"" Wilson said. ""External candidates who would have never been able to join the company now have a pathway in.""

Colleges set new course

The shift in workforce needs and hiring practices presents a new problem for colleges and universities: People who had questioned the affordability of college now may also question the necessity.

That could bode ill for colleges here and nationwide. In Minnesota total undergraduate enrollment has plummeted by almost a third since 2010 to levels last seen in the late 1990s.

Between 2010 and 2020 the share of Minnesota high school students who enter the workforce after graduation increased from 19% to 24% while the share who enroll in college decreased from 70% to 62% according to state data.

A bachelor's degree remains a time-tested path to success however. Research shows college graduates earn significantly more money over their lifetime than high school graduates and are less likely to be unemployed or live in poverty. Degree holders also vote and volunteer more often divorce less frequently and even have longer life expectancy.

""There's nothing like a college education for economic mobility. That is still true"" said Lori Carrell chancellor of the University of Minnesota's Rochester campus.

St. Cloud State University President Robbyn Wacker said she believes employers may lose out on well-rounded workers by hiring for specific skills. In college people learn secondary skills such as professional communication conflict management and leadership which help them be more effective in the workplace she said.

""Don't you want an employee that can do all of these things?"" Wacker said.

But Wacker and other college leaders acknowledge that higher education institutions must adapt to meet the needs of people who want to quickly enter the workforce.

St. Cloud State is considering upending the traditional college model by letting new students begin their studies at several points throughout the year instead of just the start of the fall or spring semesters. The university also may offer degree programs with accelerated graduation timelines.

Students are increasingly showing interest in faster programs. Nearly half of the more than 5000 U.S. high school students surveyed by the Minneapolis-based ECMC Group between February 2020 and January 2022 said they want their post-high school education to last less than four years. Those students also said they would prefer to learn on the job or in hands-on classroom settings.

The University of Minnesota Rochester is among the first colleges to pilot an accelerated bachelor's degree program. It's launching a health sciences degree program this year called ""Nxt Gen Med"" in which students will take a mix of online and in-person classes year-round allowing them to graduate in 2½ years instead of four. Students participating in the program will be guaranteed paid internships at the Mayo Clinic.

Carrell said she thinks accelerated bachelor's degree programs can lower college costs and reduce the likelihood of students dropping out. She's leading a national ""College in 3"" project that has tapped 13 colleges to explore and possibly create three-year degree programs.

""Dropping out with debt is bad for the individual"" Carrell said. ""It's also bad for society broadly when we talk about economics and we look at the incredible workforce demands right now.""

The Minnesota State colleges and universities system is focused on increasing its partnerships with employers.

Many of the system's community colleges have received grants of up to $400000 from the state Department of Employment and Economic Development in recent years to develop and deliver custom training for local businesses. Anoka-Ramsey Community College for example just received funding to provide medical device production training to employees of a manufacturer in Ramsey.

Larry Lundblad Minnesota State's executive director for workforce and economic development said these partnerships will be important as the college system seeks to educate more working adults amid an impending decline in the U.S. high school student population.

Colleges and universities will need to offer more specific career pathways Lundblad said.

""I know a lot of people that got a degree in something because they were in college and they needed to declare a major and they got out and they did something totally different"" Lundblad said. ""I think long term once we've changed systems and ways of doing business we'll see ... people being more focused in what they're doing and what they need.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmxvY2t0b24uY29tL3JlL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvemFjaC1icmVzbGluLWpvaW5zLWxvY2t0b24tcmUtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1idWlsZC1vdXQtb2YtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zach Breslin joins Lockton Re to support build out of Capital Markets Capability,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmxvY2t0b24uY29tL3JlL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvemFjaC1icmVzbGluLWpvaW5zLWxvY2t0b24tcmUtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1idWlsZC1vdXQtb2YtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533D679030>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmxvY2t0b24uY29tL3JlL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvemFjaC1icmVzbGluLWpvaW5zLWxvY2t0b24tcmUtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1idWlsZC1vdXQtb2YtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzL2NyaXN0aWFuby1yb25hbGRvLW1hbi11dGQtdHJhaW5pbmctMjcwODkxOTTSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy9jcmlzdGlhbm8tcm9uYWxkby1tYW4tdXRkLXRyYWluaW5nLTI3MDg5MTk0LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cristiano Ronaldo forces Glazers to act with complaints over Man Utd training ground,"EXCLUSIVE: Ronaldo was dismayed by the state of the facilities at United's Carrington training HQ which he felt had not been upgraded at all since he departed for Real Madrid back in 2009

Cristiano Ronaldo has forced a revamp of Manchester United's training ground swimming pool - after complaining it was old and a health hazard.

The United striker told bosses at the club's Aon training complex at Carrington he didn't want to use the main pool and plunge pool – because loose  chipped and missing tiles made it a danger. And he urged the club to re-tile and refurbish both pools telling them he couldn't believe it hadn't changed in the TWELVE years he's been away from Old Trafford.

Club bosses took his complaints seriously – and ordered remedial works on the pools which will be upgraded in time for pre season training which starts in mid July. The 37-year-old star – United's top scorer last season with 24 goals - is said to have been disappointed by the declining standards in facilities both at Carrington and Old Trafford since his shock return last summer.

And the pools in the main building of the training ground have been on his hit list since re-signing.

It's believed the Portuguese icon made sure his rented home in Cheshire had an indoor swimming pool so he could perform water-based exercises without having to use the Carrington pool. Pool-Gate is the latest in a series of issues with facilities at the club.

It's understood the club has also spent in excess of £200000 installing a new boiler system at the training ground after problems causing intermittent hot and cold water affected the training ground last winter. United's training centre was once a state-of-the-art complex when it was unveiled in 2000.

But in the last few years like Old Trafford it's fallen behind those of rivals like Manchester City Liverpool and Tottenham who have all built impressive facilities which have eclipsed Carrington. A United source said: “Cristiano is an important voice at the training ground.

How will United fare next season under Erik ten Hag? Have your say in the comments below.

“In the past players might have said something but nothing happened. If Cristiano speaks up people listen take notice and things tend to change!” Last year United applied for planning permission to build additional changing rooms offices gyms and catering areas at Carrington.

That followed a request to planners to erect new LED floodlights an all-seater stand for 500 spectators including wheelchair access. Collette Roche Chief Operating Officer explained last year: “Longer term we are looking at fuller redevelopment plans for Carrington to ensure it will be a state-of-the-art fully integrated facility for our men’s women’s and academy groups.

“Significant game-changing investment will be made into our training facilities to take Carrington to the next level once again.”",,,,,,

California District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers denied Apple’s motion to dismiss the case on Thursday and is giving the company 21 days to respond to Cydia’s refiled complaint.

Cydia developer Jay Freeman (who also goes by the username Saurik) first filed a lawsuit against Apple in 2020. The complaint alleges Apple “has wrongfully acquired and maintained monopoly power” in iOS app distribution and payments ultimately “depriving” third-party app stores of “the ability to compete with the App Store.” Cydia emerged before the Apple App Store even existed and allowed users to find and download third-party apps for jailbroken devices. Freeman shut down the Cydia store in 2018.

The judge didn’t grant Apple’s motion to dismiss the case this time

Judge Gonzalez Rogers — the same judge who issued a mixed ruling for the Epic vs. Apple trial — dismissed the case in January citing Freeman’s claims were outside of the four-year statute of limitations for antitrust lawsuits.

Apple (AAPL 0.19%) is one of the world's best-known companies. But one of the characteristics it is least known for is its dividend payment. The company is relatively new to the dividend-paying list of stocks and is far from reaching Dividend King status. The tech giant resumed paying a dividend in 2012 after a 17-year pause.

Still Apple could be an excellent dividend stock for investors who buy it today. Let's look at its capacity to pay dividends and consider its valuation to determine its virtues as a dividend stock.

Apple has delivered robust dividend growth

Income investors can be encouraged by Apple's acceleration of dividend payments. From 2012 to 2021 the company has increased its dividend per share from $0.10 to $0.85. That means shareholders saw their dividends grow more than eightfold in that time.

In that same period earnings per share rose from $1.58 to $5.61. Earnings are crucial to sustaining a dividend payment. In that regard Apple's quality earnings growth is a good sign for the prospects of dividend increases.

Its earnings are buoyed by continued innovation in its products like the iPhone Apple Watch AirPods and iPads. Supplementing that is a robust and expanding services segment that totaled 20% of revenue in its most recent quarter which ended March 26. The rise of the services segment is crucial because it generated a gross profit margin of 72.6% vs. a gross profit margin of 36.4% for its products.

While Apple's current dividend yield is a modest 0.65% there's plenty of room for it to grow when you consider the company's dividend payout ratio. This is the percentage of earnings paid out in dividends. Most recently Apple's dividend payout ratio was 14.5% so the company could sustainably increase its dividend payment even if earnings remained constant or sustain its current dividend even if profits decrease. The lower the percentage the more wiggle room a company has in its dividend payment.

Apple's stock is not expensive

Comparing Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) ratios to their historic levels reveals that it is valued slightly above the average for those ratios over the past five years. In other words in the last five years there were times when Apple was pricier and times when it was cheaper.

Another way to measure valuation is a comparison with a competitor. Using the same metrics Apple sells at a discount vs. one of its rivals Microsoft (MSFT 0.29%). Of course it is not an apples-to-apples comparison (pardon the pun) but Microsoft is a big tech stock with a mix of hardware and software revenue.

Accordingly income investors who buy Apple stock today will probably thank themselves 10 years from now. To more directly answer the question in the headline yes Apple is an excellent dividend stock to buy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9oaWdoZXN0LXBhaWQtY2Vvcy1pbi1hbWVyaWNhLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The highest paid CEOs in America in 2021,"The world’s richest person also received the highest CEO compensation in 2021.

Elon Musk the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla topped Fortune‘s new list of the most highly compensated CEOs on the Fortune 500. In 2021 Musk “realized” compensation worth almost $23.5 billion from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018 multiyear “moonshot” grant. That was—by far—the biggest CEO payday in 2021 according to our new analysis of how Fortune 500 CEOs are compensated.

After Musk the 10 most highly compensated Fortune 500 CEOs of 2021 are all tech and biotech CEOs including the heads of Apple Netflix and Microsoft. The full list is below.

CEO pay dwarfs that of the average employee. The average big-company CEO made 351 times the pay of the average worker on a realized basis in 2020 according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) which has tracked the metric for decades up from a 21-to-1 ratio back in 1965.

Our analysis evaluated the pay packages of 280 Fortune 500 CEOs who earned a median total compensation of $15.9 million up 30% from a year earlier. When calculating a CEO’s total realized pay we measured the following for the company’s most recent fiscal year: salary and bonuses; other compensation such as vested restricted stock grants long-term incentive payouts and perks; and stock gains in the form of value realized from exercising stock options. Because the value of unexercised options is unpredictable we did not consider them in our tabulation of total compensation.

Here are the highest-paid CEOs.

Cook has been CEO of Apple Inc. since 2011. He earned $770.5 million in 2021 alone mostly as a part of a 10-year grant of shares worth $1.7 billion. But his incredible pay package may be justified by Apple’s stock market performance under Cook: The tech company’s market value during his tenure has increased by $2.2 trillion.

Apple ranks 3 on the Fortune 500. The company faced challenges because of the global chip shortage but successfully began manufacturing the equipment in-house. Apple finished the year with a gargantuan $95 billion in profits—outperforming every other U.S. company on that front.

Apple declined to comment on Fortune‘s analysis.

3. Jensen Huang NVIDIA $561 million

Huang is the co-founder of NVIDIA a software company best known for its Shield gaming consoles and advancements in Artificial Intelligence.

The company ranked 134 on this year’s Fortune 500. Revenue surged 61.4%.

A spokesperson acknowledged that during the latest fiscal year Huang “realized about $507 million from expiring options that had been granted in 2011 and 2012 reflecting the approximately 60x increase in the company’s share price over the [past] decade.”

4. Reed Hastings Netflix: $453.5 million

Hastings is the co-founder CEO and chairman of the streaming giant. Under his leadership Netflix went from a DVD mail delivery service to an online streaming heavyweight.

Netflix ranked 115 on the Fortune 500 with an 18.8% change in revenue. The company has recently cut costs after losing subscribers as the world re-opens after the pandemic. Netflix also faces increased competition from streaming services.

A spokesperson disputed Fortune‘s analysis of Hastings’ realized pay and would only reiterate the total value of his “granted” compensation for 2021: “Per our proxy statement his compensation in 2021 was $40.8 million with $650000 in cash and $39.7 million in stock options.”

Schleifer is the co-founder and CEO of Regeneron a biopharmaceutical company that makes a variety of medications that treat asthma cancer chronic pain and more.

The company ranked 231 on this year’s Fortune 500. Revenue rose 89.1% in 2021 driven by the company’s REGEN-COV antibody treatment for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

A spokesperson noted that the bulk of Schleifer’s realized pay per Fortune‘s analysis “reflects the exercise of long-held options that were reaching their ten-year expiration point” and said “Regeneron’s compensation philosophy has always emphasized long-term incentives in the form of stock options and other equity-based awards as we believe this aligns employee interests with the typically long-term nature of drug development.”

An outbreak of COVID-19 in China has kept its financial hub Shanghai largely paralysed by a city-wide lockdown — now in its seventh week. Beijing meanwhile has ramped up its quarantine efforts.

The iPhone maker’s supplier Foxconn has been able to keep its workers on-site in a “closed loop” system to limit the impact on production but lockdowns in the country have pushed many to sound demand-related warnings.

Apple had also said last month any new lockdowns in China and Taiwan where many parts and iPhones are produced could bring new obstacles in terms of supply and demand in the current quarter.

The developments also comes as investors brace for a drop in consumer spending on tech gadgets and services as the war in Ukraine drives up the cost of oil food and other staples.

Separately Nikkei reported on Wednesday that the company had told its suppliers to speed up iPhone development after China’s COVID-19 lockdowns hampered schedule for at least one of the new phones.

We have synthesized a SERS encoded core–shell nanostructure comprising silver NPs agglomerates. Figure 1A shows the geometry of AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 . The plasmonic encoded nanoagglomerates are within a silica layer. This layer offers unique properties (e.g. surface chemistry biocompatibility optical transparency and colloidal stability). As a result it protects the nanoagglomerates from oxidation and signal-contamination thus ensuring a long-term SERS signal stability. The AgNPs were spherical with an anisotropy aspect ratio close to 1. We analysed more than 100 AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 from the TEM images. Around 1% of the particles were non-spherical i.e. rod-shaped particles or quasi-flat triangles. More than 60% of the agglomerates were isolated dimers trimers tetramers pentamers hexamers or mixtures thereof. Each NP have four different angles for size measurement. The AgNPs core was approx. 60–70 nm and the SiO 2 layer was around 20 nm. The complete size of AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 was around 110 nm (Fig. 1B) and their hydrodynamic diameter 133.8 nm (PDI 0.130) with a zeta potential of -24.7 mV (cf. SI Fig. S1). Further characterization of the NPs was performed with the UV–Vis spectrum37. Figure 1C shows the normalized extinction spectra of the individual citrate capped AgNPs and the nanoagglomerates AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 . The characteristic spherical AgNPs’ LSPRs is centred around 430 nm. As for AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2  it appears a new prominent shoulder absorption at around 700 nm. This red-shift and broadening of the LSPR to higher wavelengths confirmed the formation of nanoagglomerates.

Previous reported articles used ethanol as solvent during Raman probe modification based on the consideration of low solubility of hydrophobic Raman probes38. However to the best of our knowledge there is still lack of detailed information on the fundamental factors affecting Raman probes NPs’ modification. Therefore we studied the formation of thiol-silver bond as a function of pH and solvent within this work. We used CTPEG12 to stabilize the system during the modification under different pHs. The SERS probe used here is an aromatic molecule MBA which has high Raman cross section1839 and the polymeric stabilizer CTPEG12 is an aliphatic chain polymer with 12 carbon atoms and a carboxylic group at the end of the chain. Both MBA and CTPEG12 were bonded to AgNPs through their thiol group by forming covalent bonds.

To study the pH and solvent effect on MBA adsorption we monitored the evolution of the characteristic ring breathing band of adsorbed MBA at 1075 cm−1 over the time40 and under different conditions (Fig. 1DE). AgNPs@MBA were dispersed in 50% EtOH/water solution (Fig. 1D and cf. SI Fig. S2) or in aqueous solution (Fig. 1E and cf. SI Fig. S3) containing no or different amount of NaOH from 10 min to 24 h. Water and ethanol have different physical property (e.g. pKa and dielectric constant) therefore it was not surprising to measure different pH values for each of the solvents even with the same amount of NaOH41 (cf. SI Table S1).

Figure 1DE shows the adsorption and bonding kinetic results of MBA onto the AgNPs under the different conditions (pH and solvent) and over time. When comparing the first 10 min after the addition of Raman code in both solvents the intensity at 1075 cm−1 increased along with the system pH and amount of added NaOH. The codification reached a plateau intensity in a pH dependent manner being shorter under increased alkaline conditions. The adsorption of thiol onto silver mental surface follows physisorption to chemisorption where the S–H bond breaks and forms silver thiol covalent bond42. Environmental pH will affect the deprotonation of thiol group thus will affect the formation speed of silver thiol bond. As we observed in our system an alkaline environment facilitates the codification of MBA onto silver metallic surfaces. When comparing the plateau intensity after 24 h the number of adsorbed MBA were similar when the codification was performed in 50% ethanol/water solution with 1.15 mM NaOH (pH 8) and in aqueous solution with 0.046 mM NaOH (pH 8.5). These conditions exhibited the maximum SERS intensity among all. Subsequent additions of NaOH and pH increase resulted in a MBA codification decrease in both solvents. Considering that the pKa of MBA and CTPEG12 is around 4–543 the deprotonated MBA and CTPEG12 are both negatively charged. This electrostatic repulsion on the surface and the competition between MAB and CTPEG12 will hamper MBA bonding from the bulk solution since in general compared with aromatic thiols aliphatic thiols have better electrochemical and thermodynamic stability44. Dissociation was also favored at higher pH45 which could also be related to this dynamic equilibrium. Ethanol has little effect on the modification and stability of metal-thiol bond. Although it was demonstrated that because of the reduction effect of ethanol on gold the strength of metal-thiol contacts can be weakened46 ethanol is still recommended for hydrophobic Raman probes.

The number of MBA molecules adsorbed on the metallic surface and the packing of the monolayer is discussed within this work. We show that they depend on factors like the metal-thiol bonding formation speed which is affected by pH the electrostatic repulsion on the metallic surface and the competition between Raman probe and stabilizer. Controlling the pH in reaction is especially critical to achieve optimized codification of metallic surfaces with thiolated aromatic compounds.

By controlling the agglomeration of AgNPs@MBA and the MBA adsorption we managed to increase the SERS efficiency up to nearly 40 times when comparing the SERS spectra (characteristic peak intensity at 1075 cm−1) of AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 and non-agglomerated AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 (Fig. 1F). This high SERS response was attributed to active SERS structures called “hot spots”14. In comparison to aggregation or uncontrolled agglomeration (cf. Fig. S5) where the NPs merged without hot spots38 controlled agglomeration offers a useful tool to rationally design nanomaterials for SERS labelling.

Herewith we report a universal protocol for synthesizing stabile SERS encoded core–shell nanostructure. We used the same protocol for other plasmonic nanoestructures like gold (cf. SI Fig. S6) and for other Raman probes47.

Stability of the AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 SERS signal after labelling different types of substrates

We analysed the SERS signal robustness and stability of our AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 by depositing them onto 10 different substrates made of different materials (cf. SI Fig. S7). Figure 2 shows corresponding SERS spectra and zoomed characteristic MBA peak at 1075 cm−1 of AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 demonstrating efficient labelling of all substrates. Except for glass which shows a broad band between 1000 and 1800 cm−1 the background signal originated from all substrates was neglectable. Regardless both effects did not affect the characteristic bands of MBA at 1075 cm−1 which is used for tracing and labelling. We did observe an uneven SERS intensity between all substrates that can be explained by differences in the distribution of AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 within the different substrates.

Figure 2 SERS characterization of different substrates wherein the AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 has been placed. (A) SERS spectra and (B) zoomed spectra showing characteristic peak at 1075 cm−1 of AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 on different materials: 1 semi-aniline leather; 2 aniline leather; 3 pigmented leather; 4 polyester; 5 silk; 6 plastic (PVC); 7 glass; 8 brass; 9 cotton; and 10 dyed pigmented leather. Full size image

We decided to examine the AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 distribution within the different substrates and its impact on the NPs’ geometry (Fig. 3). For example in the case of cotton (Fig. 3B) the NPs are deposited onto the cotton fibres and hidden within the fibres whereas in the leather (Fig. 3A) the NPs were more localized in the labelling spot (zoomed SEM areas of Fig. 3AB). SEM images shows that the distribution can vary with surface properties of the substrates like roughness and porosity. Distribution of the NPs within the substrate can influence the SERS signal. Indeed we observed that the SERS signal for the dye pigmented leather was higher than for cotton (Fig. 2). The leather is less rough and porous than cotton thus hindering the diffusion of the AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 through the substrate and enhancing the SERS signal. At any rate both substrates demonstrated preservation of the NPs’ geometry thus SERS signal despite the different distribution. For the elemental analysis (Fig. 3DE) we took two areas of the labeled spot on the leather (Fig. 3C) one with visible AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 (spectrum 1) and another with no visible NPs (spectrum 2). Figure 3D confirms the presence of trace elements from the AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 .

AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 exhibit robust SERS signals; obtained in 0.1 s and with insignificant interfere by other components of the substrate. This provides our SERS-responsive NPs with numerous potential applications where high optical signal is needed. The application field ranges from industrial applications (labelling and tracing of goods) where a robust labelling signal is required or tracing to clinical biosensing and environmental sciences.

Within this work we demonstrate the capabilities of our AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 to enhance the sensitivity of immunoassays for example to detect immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein responsible for COVID-19 pandemics.

SERS-based SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD diagnosis

Herewith we prepared our SERS-based diagnostic kit followed a sandwich-based assay consisting of a substrate functionalized with capture antibody antigen for diagnosis and signal amplification system. In our case the readout is the SERS signal provided by the AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 which recognizes the antigen upon their surface functionalization with the antibody. Figure 4 shows a scheme of the technology.

Figure 4 Scheme of the rational and controlled synthesis of robust and stabile SERS encoded plasmonic-silica nanocomposites for enhanced fast sensitive and selective labeling and biosensing. Full size image

For the surface functionalization of the AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 with the antibody we first attached a linker (GPTMS) through a reaction called epoxy-silanization48. It enriches the NPs’ surface with epoxy groups which are highly active towards amino groups. Thus forming covalent bonds between antibodies and GPTMS-NPs. The obtained AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 @Ab recognize the immunogenic spike RBD protein (cf. SI Fig. S9).

Once we engineered the detecting antibody with a SERS readout we prepared the plate by coating the substrate with a SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody. Upon addition of the spike RBD protein and rinsing the unbounded molecules we added our AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 @Ab. The NPs recognize the antigen protein via a second recognition site and are immobilized onto the plate substrate. This recognition provides a positive SERS signal (enhancement of the 1075 cm−1 band) thus confirming virus detection (Fig. 5). The signal was fast (1 s) and specific for the viral protein. Neither the plate (cf. SI Fig. S9) nor the absence of antigenic spike RBD protein (Fig. 5A red) or/and the absence of capturing antibody (Fig. 5A blue green respectively) provided a SERS positive signal. In the absence of capturing antibody we increased the concentration of antigen one order of magnitude to detect possible unspecific interactions of the antigen with the plate that could be responsible for false positive results but we did not detect signal. Only when the viral antigen was immobilized the AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 @Ab provided a strong SERS enhancement of the specific band at 1075 cm−1. The enhancement was 20 times higher than in the control samples.

Figure 5 Functional validation of our SERS-based diagnostic test. (A) Averaged SERS spectra collected from AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 @Ab in the presence of 100 ng/mL antigenic spike RBD protein (black) and in the absence of antigen (red) capturing antibody (blue) or both (green). In the absence of capturing antibody the concentration of antigen was increased to 1 μg/mL. (B) SERS intensity at 1075 cm−1 provided by the AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 @Ab incubated with different amount of antigenic spike RBD protein (from 0 to1.6 μg/mL). The results correspond to an average of 8 spectra recorded from 8 random places in the plate. Full size image

We correlated the concentration of AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 @Ab with the amount of SARS-CoV spike RBD protein (Fig. S10). We selected a concentration of 9 × 109 NPs/mL for all experiments because the signal was highest while maintaining the sensitivity. We further conducted the tests with a concentration series of the antigen ranging from 0 to 1.6 μg/mL (Fig. 5B). The intensity ratio between 10 and 0 ng/mL at 1075 cm−1 was close to 6 revealing that the LOD of AgNPs@MBA@SiO 2 @Ab for antigenic spike RBD protein detection should be lower than 10 ng/mL.

We want to mention that when the antigen concentration is higher than 100 ng/mL the response is less sensitive to small changes in analyst’s concentration (Fig. 5B). However the specificity is maintained since we obtained positive signals all over the antigen concentration range. A reduction in the sensitivity can be neglected in the cases where a qualitative response is required like for example for the fast diagnosis of viral infections.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Smith is disappointed with Patrick Beverley for his behavior toward a fan and a producer following the Bucks' loss. (2:30)

INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis police announced Wednesday they've opened an investigation into an ""NBA player and citizen"" altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley threw a ball at a fan in the final minutes of a season-ending loss to the Indiana Pacers.

Police said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives ""who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.""

Detectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office at the conclusion of the investigation the release stated.

Cameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands hitting a fan in the head with about 2½ minutes left in Thursday's contest. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley who was holding his arm out for it the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.

Beverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of ""The Pat Bev Podcast"" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before but added that his own actions were ""still inexcusable.""

""I will be better"" he said. ""I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

Beverley added the atmosphere in Indianapolis ""was great"" aside from ""a handful of fans"" who crossed a line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98 eliminating Milwaukee in six games in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

""I will be better. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

""I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more"" Beverley said. ""That ... threw my whole vibe off.""

After the game Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.

The Therapists Quit.,"In spring 2023 members of the American Friends Service Committee a prominent Philadelphia-based social justice organization published a letter renouncing one of their own. It alleged that Raquel Saraswati its chief equity and inclusion officer who for years had claimed to be a person of Arab South Asian and Latino descent was in fact a white woman.

Saraswati who had often spoken publicly about LGBTQ+ rights BIPOC empowerment and Islamophobia denied the allegations. Nonetheless she resigned from the organization in February as well-regarded local news outlets picked up the story. In February 2023 The Intercept quoted Saraswati’s mother saying that her daughter who legally changed her last name from Seidel years ago was “as white as the driven snow.”

Some activists compared Saraswati to Rachel Dolezal the disgraced former president of the Spokane NAACP chapter who was born to white parents but claimed she was Black.

Saraswati found a place to land after her disgrace: Full Spectrum Therapy an LGBTQ+ psychotherapy clinic in Portland that focuses on serving low-income trans and nonbinary clients. She handles equity and human resources for the clinic.

The refuge was short-lived. Soon after her hiring therapists at Full Spectrum found out who she was and raised objections to her hiring in a Sept. 22 email to the clinic’s founder. But Saraswati stayed employed. (By all accounts Saraswati works remotely from Philadelphia.)

By the beginning of 2024 more than half of the therapists at Full Spectrum had left because of Saraswati’s hiring.

Full Spectrum is one of a handful of clinics in the city that specializes in counseling for trans and nonbinary clients—a type of care that’s in increasingly high demand. In fact the absence of culturally specific and gender-identity-specific therapy is so pronounced that the Oregon Legislature recently directed $80 million to building up culturally responsive behavioral health providers—$235000 of it to Full Spectrum.

The exodus from Full Spectrum widened the desert of clinics that work specifically with trans and nonbinary clients.

“There are such limited resources for trans and nonbinary clients who can’t do private pay. That’s what makes this extra painful and heartbreaking for us” says Kaspar Woods one of the clinicians who left Full Spectrum in the fall. “It’s heartbreaking to have to bring this level of conflict to a trans person.”

Full Spectrum CEO Sam Skye says that “calling Raquel a danger to clients and staff echoes the anti-Muslim bigotry rampant today. It is very disappointing that any former staff would perpetuate these prejudices.”

Saraswati echoed that in a statement.

“The tropes of a ‘sneaky conniving manipulative woman’ and ‘untrustworthy lying infiltrating Muslim’ are deeply harmful discriminatory and hateful’” Saraswati said adding that she won’t resign. “If anything this has opened the door for me to experience further harassment and harm.”

Skye opened a small therapy practice in Portland in 2017. His aim: to serve a population that’s increasingly seeking therapy but has few places to turn.

More than 90% of Full Spectrum’s clients are on Medicaid. That means the practice serves a population that’s doubly marginalized both for their gender identity and because they’re low-income. Over the past few years Skye expanded the clinic to include more than 20 licensed and pre-licensed therapists.

Skye had joined a slice of the therapy market that the Oregon Legislature was trying to build up. Since May 2022 the Oregon Health Authority has provided $350000 in grants to Full Spectrum two-thirds of which came from a state program aimed at recruiting and retaining behavioral health providers that serve underrepresented communities.

On Sept. 8 the clinic’s clinical director announced the hiring of a woman named Raquel as the Director of People and Culture. The email did not include Raquel’s last name nor any information about her work experience. That woman was Saraswati.

In a Sept. 18 staff meeting Saraswati introduced herself. Former clinicians WW spoke to said she made vague reference to a smear campaign she’d endured earlier that year.

That rang a bell for one of the clinicians who found Saraswati’s backstory in news clips. That clinician told others what they’d found and word seemed to have circled back to Skye. On Sept. 20 Skye sent the staff a 1200-word telling of Saraswati’s story in which Skye painted Saraswati as a victim.

“Raquel shared a laundry list of conspiracy claims she’s suffered from being accused of having two husbands to wearing a prosthetic nose to being a double agent for a foreign government” Skye wrote. “She described the events that transpired at her former workplace and the ongoing harassment death threats and targeting by groups motivated by their racist Islamophobic misogynistic and homophobic aims.”

Skye called Saraswati a woman of color in his email and said Saraswati’s story was a “tale of leadership identity and overcoming adversity.”

Two days later a handful of clinicians sent an anonymous letter to Skye demanding that he fire Saraswati immediately.

“The staff of Full Spectrum Therapy assert that [Raquel’s] presence at FST presents a clear and immediate threat to the wellbeing of our clients our staff and the Portland community” they wrote on Sept. 22. “FST staff demand immediate removal of [Raquel] from all responsibilities at FST. …Staff is united in our demands and prepared to stop work to protect ourselves and our clients from further harm.”

Clinicians exchanged worries about Saraswati’s hiring in a September email chain.

One wrote of their concerns “So even while I can critique and question the social construction of race in America I am also aware that we need strong opposition to the Rachel Dolezal’s of the world from appropriating the language of gender dysphoria to justify their behavior.”

Later that day Skye scheduled a Monday Zoom meeting with clinicians about Saraswati. He instructed clinicians not to record the meeting for “legal” reasons.

Skye opened the meeting with a long statement his voice sounding tired and quivery. He called the anonymous email sent by staff the “antithesis of collective liberation” and said that “veiled threats are not acceptable here.”

One at a time staff asked Skye questions about Saraswati’s hiring process. He explained he’d hired Saraswati as a contractor in February and then hired her full-time that fall. He’d met Saraswati because she was a friend of the then-chief operating officer at Full Spectrum Trystan Reese. There was no job posting and no other candidates were considered Skye said.

“When you have a candidate whose resume is ideal and is also a diverse candidate” Skye said “there’s no reason to bring white candidates into the picture.”

To Eli Cuda a former clinician who left in November it felt like Skye had been hiding Saraswati. “It felt like we were unwilling participants in this secret” Cuda says.

By mid-December at least 10 clinicians had left the practice because of Saraswati’s hiring and Skye’s refusal to fire her. All were trans or nonbinary and several were people of color.

Quinn Rivenburgh a licensed therapist who worked at Full Spectrum from 2021 to November 2023 and supervised 12 of the clinic’s pre-licensed clinicians says Skye instructed them during the height of the Saraswati backlash to “defend the interests of the company.”

“That was a huge red flag for me” Rivenburgh recalls “due to the potential to compromise my ethics and responsibilities as a clinical supervisor.”

Rivenburgh was laid off in November after many of their direct reports quit. Some of the clinicians who departed started private practices. Others joined existing clinics. All tell WW they felt Saraswati’s hiring at Full Spectrum had the potential to hurt their vulnerable clients.

Skye called the therapists’ letter “a demonstration of discriminatory harassment containing falsehoods lies libelous statements regarding fraud and theft and malicious distortions of the truth” and added that staff turnover is typical while a business is shifting.

Saraswati says she takes her job seriously. “Under no circumstances have I ever compromised confidentiality or put any colleague at risk” Saraswati said. “This is a problem some have created in order to force an outcome.”

The current staffing level at Full Spectrum is unclear.

Some clinicians say they felt like they abandoned their clients some of whom were estranged from their families and had formed a deep connection with their therapist.

“The secure attachment that’s formed between a therapist and a client is incredibly healing” Cuda says. “When it’s disrupted it’s really disruptive to the client.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pYW1paGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC9uYXRpb25hbC9hcnRpY2xlMjg4NDEyNDQzLmh0bWzSAUxodHRwczovL2FtcC5taWFtaWhlcmFsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvbmF0aW9uYWwvYXJ0aWNsZTI4ODQxMjQ0My5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retired police dog was abandoned by handler at animal shelter Georgia sheriff says,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.miamiherald.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/nation-world/national/article288412443.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533D409CF0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pYW1paGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC9uYXRpb25hbC9hcnRpY2xlMjg4NDEyNDQzLmh0bWzSAUxodHRwczovL2FtcC5taWFtaWhlcmFsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvbmF0aW9uYWwvYXJ0aWNsZTI4ODQxMjQ0My5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Two of the biggest players in the electronics design automation segment of the semiconductor industry are Cadence Design (CDNS -0.52%) and Synopsys (SNPS 0.16%). In this video clip from the ""Semiconductor Revolution"" show on Motley Fool Live recorded on May 19 Fool.com contributor Nick Rossolillo outlines several metrics that make them high-performing stocks.

10 stocks we like better than Cadence Design Systems

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Cadence Design Systems wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of April 27 2022

Nicholas Rossolillo: Two companies that I'm going to highlight here very briefly Cadence Design and Synopsys. These are the two heavy hitters in this space. You can think of them essentially like Autodesk of the semiconductor industry. These are software companies that help semiconductor firms design and test their chips. They help with integration of chips into a larger computing unit that help with actual software system verification like to make sure the chip is running the software properly. All sorts of cool stuff.

Because it's software again the nitpicky thing with the semiconductor industry is that it's cyclical. That these are like subscription software businesses so you get the nice steady increase in revenue from a software business but they service the semiconductor industry.

These are two really interesting stocks if you're looking for a bet on chips but you don't want to play that cyclical game where one year you're having booming sales and then maybe the next you flatline or have a decline in sales. That can be a roller coaster for some of these chip companies but that's not really going to happen with these two.

Just some quick highlights. You can see both of them very very high gross profit margins. Lots of free cash flow in the last couple of years. Again a software each incremental sale that they make most of that money just goes directly to the bottom line super-efficient operating model. Both of them have lots of cash.

Synopsys I haven't finished doing a complete update because they actually just reported on earnings the other day. I thought it was a little bit unfair maybe to compare Synopsys with an extra quarter of results compared to Cadence Design over the last couple of years. But the long and the short here is both of these companies are I think fantastic.

I don't know that you necessarily need to pick one or the other I think Cadence Design is a popular pick around the Fool. I know I've covered it on a handful of times. But you you're going to get very similar results from both of these stocks I believe. So you can buy both of them or just pick one if you want more stable business performance from the chip industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhY2tzdGVyLmlvL3JwYXR0ZXJzb24vYXJkdWluby1kdWUtNi1jaGFubmVsLXNlcnZvLWN1cnJlbnQtc2Vuc29yLXNoaWVsZC02ZmFkMTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arduino Due 6-Channel Servo Current Sensor Shield,"Design

The design intent is to enable inferences to be drawn regarding the work being done (i.e. torque applied) by each servo based on the servo current draw (ref).

The design builds on the typical application circuit published in the ACS712 datasheet replicating this six times (one for each servo to be measured). To reduce the number of Arduino pins used from six analog pins down to one analogue common pin and three digital selection pins a 74HC4051 multiplexer is used.

Both the ICs are powered at 5V and a voltage divider brings this output down to a safer level for the 3.3V Arduino Due.

The physical shape of the PCB started with the footprint of an Arduino Due. CAD files for a blank shield are linked in the attachments. The edge of the board which has no pin headers on an Arduino Due was extended out so that three-pin connectors could be added for the six servo input and output connections. By extending the PCB these connectors are outboard and clear of any other stacked shields.

The schematic for the board is in the attachments both as a PDF and as links to CAD files.

Prototype Testing

The first iteration of prototype testing revolved around the ACS712 sensor. I wanted to check that introducing the output voltage shift from 5V to 3.3V worked as intended. I also wanted to see what value looked good for the filter capacitor on pin 6 of the ACS712.

At different times I used both a commercial ACS712 breakout board and a home built perfboard version. On the perfboard I was able to add the voltage divider and try various values of the filter capacitor.

ACS712 breakout boards

My test rig used a Gobilda servo programmer to deliver 6V 5A power from a bench power supply along with suitable PWM signals to the servo under test. I powered the ACS712 from an Arduino Due using the 5V pin but the Arduino wasn't used for anything else in the initial tests just power.

ACS712 protype test rig.

I used an oscilloscope connected to the ACS712 output to evaluate results and to compare readings for different types of load on the servo.

Sample Oscilloscope output 470nF filter capacitor reduced voltage output servo under physical load during swing motion.

The second set of prototype testing added the multiplexor to the ACS712 test bed. I wanted to check that no additional noise was introduced to the ACS712 output and also that driving the 74HC4051 selector pins at 3.3V levels would work OK. This test rig also enabled me to start working on a sample Arduino sketch in parallel to getting the PCB design finalised and the order submitted to PCBWay.

Adding multiplexor (bottom) to the test rig.

PCB Manufacture

This project was sponsored by PCBWay. It was the first time I had designed a PCB and sent it for manufacture and I learned a few things along the way. Most of the learnings were newbie issues getting my schematic and PCB design worked up to a good quality level in Fusion 360 computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacture (CAM) software. Once I had the design in Fusion 360 exporting the required Gerber files from the CAM module was very simple.

Uploading the job to PCBWay took a few days - - all down to me I had to travel on a business trip in the middle of the process. The PCBway website is straight forward and the very many options are documented clearly. Once I had the files uploaded the job moved along immediately to quality control.

Initial estimates for the job were approximately USD$35 for fabrication and the same for assembly more on this later.

I requested two services on my job PCB fabrication and also supply and assembly of the surface mount components. PCB fabrication uses gerber and drill files. Assembly requires additional Bill of Materials (BOM file); Pick and Place (PnP / Centroid) files and other optional design files. The quality review was very quick on the fabrication part of the job and a day or so on the assembly part. I had made an error on one of the parts selected. The ACS712 library component I had used in Fusion 360 did not contain sufficient CAM information to identify the specific part. I received a clear email from a customer service representative requesting me to confirm the BOM and provide the extra details which was easy to do. I was impressed by the PCBWay customer service a person available on chat and email was very helpful. All the communication was in English which was essential for me.

This is when the pandemic chip shortage complicated things. All of the online distributors I was familiar with were quoting lead times of more than six months on the ACS712ELCTR-05B-T sensor IC with prices more than AUD$10 for single units. I opted to allow PCBWay to substitute suitable alternatives from other manufacturers and crossed my fingers. PCBWay were able to find a component supplier and lead time of about one month at a unit cost of USD$4.18. This has obviously made my costs higher but I think it's a win that PCBWay found a solution for me in the current market.

Component unit price breakdown. The component driving the cost of the project is pretty obvious.

I was keen to keep track of my first PCB boards and found that the PCBWay website is very informative. I could track the job through its stages and watch its progress towards completion.

Once the assembly job got to the quality control stage a PCBWay employee contacted me by email with photographs of a board to check that IC orientations were all as anticipated.

The boards arrived ahead of schedule well packed and are great quality. I soldered on some pin headers and started testing.

The completed shield

Software

The sample sketches (see the Github link below) progressively build up from a minimal example to more useful examples. The sample sketches are:

Sample_1.ino: a minimal example taking a reading from one sensor

Sample_2.ino: adds in running averages and Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) methods to smooth the reading output

Sample_3.ino: adds the data structures to track all six sensors

Sample_4.ino: switchs to non-blocking code

The formulaes applied to convert the ADC sample read by the Arduino to a current reading are as follows:

From the ACS712 datasheet:

Ip = (VIOUT - VIOUT(Q)) / SENSITIVITY

To calculate the voltage divider level shift:

Vout = Vin * R2 / (R1+R2)

To convert the ADC sample read by the Arduino into a voltage:

Sample serial plotter output of Sample_4.ino showing servo one under load

Connecting it Up

Connectors:

JP [1-6] + to servo driver / power source

[1-6] JP [1-6] - to servo / load

Arduino Pin Usage:

D2 sensor selector A output

D3 sensor selector B output

D4 sensor selector C output

A8 (input) sensor reading from selected sensor level shifted to 3.3V

Reflection

During the course of the build I learned more about the limitations of hall sensors which are the basis of the ACS712. The accuracy seems to be sufficient for this application but if I needed to build something more precise in the future I'd probably look at modifying the design to replace the ACS712 IC with simple shunt resistors combined with a suitable amplifier IC (e.g. INA219).

I'll definitely be using PCBWay again their quality and communications makes their price point very attractive.

This post supports remediating vulnerabilities only on Linux operating systems supported by the Systems Manager agent.

AWS recently launched the new Amazon Inspector for performing continuous vulnerability scans on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and container images stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). These scans assess software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. The new Amazon Inspector uses the Systems Manager (SSM) agent to collect software application inventory of the Amazon EC2 instances. Then Inspector scans this data and identifies software vulnerabilities a crucial step in vulnerability management.

You should perform regular patching operations for resolving vulnerabilities identified by Amazon Inspector based on the severity of the vulnerabilities. You can use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate the process of patching nodes managed by Systems Manager using the SSM agent. There may be zero-day or other high and critical severity vulnerabilities where patches are available. However you may not want to wait for the regular patching schedule to remediate them. In these cases on-demand mechanisms for patching should exist.

This series provides two methods for remediating Amazon Inspector software vulnerability findings on-demand using a Systems Manager Automation runbook. An Automation runbook defines the AWS Systems Manager’s actions on your managed instances and other AWS resources when an automation runs. It contains one or more steps that run in sequential order or branches based on preceding steps. You can prepare both methods in your AWS account to be ready for use when speed is critical to remediate software package vulnerabilities identified by Inspector.

In Part 1 of this series you’ll learn how to remediate Inspector findings for a specific vulnerability affecting multiple EC2 instances. You will use AWS Security Hub custom actions to trigger a Systems Manager Automation runbook for on-demand vulnerability patching on the selected EC2 instances.

In Part 2 you’ll learn how to directly invoke the Systems Manager Automation runbook to remediate all Amazon Inspector findings for EC2 instances using resource tags and Amazon Inspector finding severity. You’ll use the Systems Manager Automation runbook direct invocation method if you want to attempt patching all software vulnerabilities identified by Inspector. This approach effectively manages the EC2 instance fleet using tag-based targeting across your AWS Organization.

These methods work in multiple regions and accounts managed by an AWS Organization. They can help you reduce the operational complexity of manual updates reduce errors and increase the remediation speed.

Solution overview

Remediate using Security Hub custom action

This method lets you remediate selected Amazon Inspector findings from Security Hub using custom actions. The custom action enables an Automation runbook for selected findings. Then the Automation runbook will use the affected packages’ information from the Amazon Inspector findings details and use Systems Manager Patch manager to update only these packages to the latest version. Enable Security Hub to use this method.

For example there are affected packages in the following figure curl and libcurl  for CVE 2017-8816. When the user invokes the custom action for this finding Systems Manager Patch Manager updates both packages on the target managed instance. Amazon Inspector will automatically close all of the findings associated with these affected packages shortly after the vulnerability is patched.

Figure 1: Finding details in the Amazon Inspector Console.

The Security Hub delegated administrator account can trigger the automation runbook and target Amazon EC2 instances in member accounts in a multi-account multi-region scenario. This post provides two custom actions that update the affected packages and either perform a reboot or defer the instance reboot. You can choose to reboot the Amazon EC2 instance after installing updates to benefit immediately from the updates. Furthermore you can delay the reboot to your maintenance window by selecting the no reboot option.

With this custom action we recommend searching Amazon Inspector findings with a specific CVE. You can use the Title filter in Security Hub filter match type as starts with and enter the CVE as shown using arrows in the following figure. Use the Resource Type filter with AwsEc2Instance to only show findings associated with Amazon EC2 instances. Once these filters are selected Security Hub will show you all Amazon EC2 instances affected by the CVE. Then you can choose all the findings displayed with this filter associated with Amazon EC2 instances and run the custom action.

The following figure illustrates that you can run the custom action on multiple findings associated with different Amazon EC2 instances. However you shouldn’t select numerous Amazon Inspector findings for the same Amazon EC2 instance. To resolve multiple Amazon Inspector findings for the same Amazon EC2 instances see Part 2 of this series.

Figure 2: Selecting multiple Amazon Inspector findings for remediation in Security Hub.

Architecture overview

The automation workflow enables the resolveInspectorFindingsRunbook custom Automation runbook provided in this post. Security Hub Custom action initiates this runbook as described in the solution overview section. Let’s review the process as shown in the following figure:

Figure 3: Automation process in multiple accounts

When using the Security Hub custom action you select the Amazon Inspector finding in Security Hub and invoke the custom action. An event is sent to Amazon EventBridge with the Amazon Inspector finding details. The resolveInspectorFindings EventBridge rule matches this event pattern. The resolveInspectorFindings EventBridge rule parses the Amazon EC2 instance ID and Amazon Inspector finding ID to the Automation runbook as parameters. The reboot option is selected based on the custom action being used. The resolveInspectorFindingsRunbook creates a multi-account and multi-Region StartAutomationExecution API call to initiate the patch workflow in the target account and Region of the Amazon EC2 instance. A Python script gathers the affected packages for the Amazon Inspector finding as shown in Figure 1. Then the script creates a patch install override list from the affected packages gathered. The delegated administrator account stores the list in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. The AWS CloudFormation template provided with this post creates this bucket . A Run Command task for the document AWS-RunPatchBaseline is run on the Amazon EC2 instance using the install override list created in Step 4. The reboot option is passed based on the Security Hub custom action selected. If an existing patching operation is running on the target Amazon EC2 instance the Automation runbook doesn’t proceed. If an update is available the AWS-RunPatchBaseline install operation updates the affected packages identified in the patch install override list to the latest version available. Once the update completes the Automation runbook queries the Systems Manager for the State Manager association applied to the Amazon EC2 instance to gather software inventory using the AWS-GatherSoftwareInventory document. The association for AWS-GatherSoftwareInventory immediately initiates to apply on the Amazon EC2 instance to refresh inventory. The Amazon EC2 instance sends refreshed inventory information to AWS Systems Manager.

Amazon Inspector sets the remediated finding status to CLOSED if new patches are installed successfully. Security Hub’s corresponding finding record state sets to ARCHIVED.

Prerequisites

The required prerequisites are as follows:

Systems Manager must manage the Amazon EC2 instances. Enable Security Hub

Create Security Hub custom actions for resolving Amazon Inspector Findings. Deploy the CloudFormation template for the Automation runbook. Create execution roles for multi-account and multi-Region using StackSets. Update EC2 IAM instance roles with permissions to access the install override list S3 bucket. Remediate vulnerabilities using the Security Hub custom action.

Step 1: Create Security Hub custom actions for resolving Amazon Inspector Findings

In the Security Hub delegated administrator account and Region navigate to the Security Hub console. In the left-hand navigation pane choose Settings and select the Custom actions tab. Choose Create custom action. For remediating Amazon Inspector findings without rebooting the EC2 instance perform the following steps:

Set the Action name to Rem-Inspector-NoRBT . Set the Description of the custom action such as Action that will remediate Amazon Inspector findings without restarting the instance. Set the Custom action ID to InspectorRemNoRBT .



Figure 4: Create Security Hub custom action for remediating findings without instance reboot

To create a second custom action for remediating Inspector findings and rebooting the EC2 instance perform the following steps:

Set the Action name to Rem-Inspector-RBT . Set the Description for the custom action such as Action that will remediate Amazon Inspector findings and reboot the EC2 instance. Set the Custom action ID to InspectorRemRBT .

Copy the custom action ARNs this will be used in the next step.

Figure 5: Security Hub custom action ARNs.

Step 2: Deploy the CloudFormation template for automation runbook

The AWS CloudFormation template provided with this post deploys the resources necessary to enable Amazon Inspector to find resolution in your AWS account. You must deploy these resources in your Security Hub delegated administrator account. The CloudFormation should be deployed only in the aggregator region if using Security Hub cross-region aggregation.

Open the following GitHub page and download the ResolveInspectorFindingsCFN.yaml file:

https://github.com/aws-samples/automate-vulnerability-management-and-remediation/blob/main/templates/resolveInspectorFindingsCFN.yaml

Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console in the Security Hub delegated administrator account and Region. Create a stack using the ResolveInspectorFindingsCFN.yaml

template file. On the Specify stack details page perform the following steps: Set the Stack name to a descriptive stack name. Set the RemediateInspectorFindingCustomActionNoRBTArn to the Security Hub custom action ARN copied in the previous section to remediate Amazon Inspector findings without rebooting the EC2 instance. Set the RemediateInspectorFindingCustomActionRBTArn to Security Hub custom action ARN copied in the previous section to remediate Amazon Inspector findings and reboot the EC2 instance. Set the OrganizationId to the Organization ID if deploying this template in the delegated administrator or management account. You can find your Organization ID by navigating to the AWS Organization console as illustrated below. Leave this field empty if deploying this template in a standalone account.



Figure 6: Organization’s console.

e. Choose Next

Figure 7: Stack details page.

On the Configure stack options page optionally add required tags and then choose Next. Review the parameters. Select I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names. Next choose Create Stack to submit your stack configuration. After refreshing the page the status of your stack should be CREATE_IN_PROGRESS. When the status changes to CREATE_COMPLETE proceed to the next section. You can view the resources created in the resources tab of the CloudFormation console. Copy the AutomationRunbookName and InstallOverrideListS3BucketName from the outputs tab of the CloudFormation console as illustrated below. You will use these in the following steps.

Figure 8: CloudFormation outputs tab.

Step 3: Create execution roles for multi-account and multi-Region automation using StackSet

You must create the Automation execution cross-account role for triggering this automation (deployed in previous step) from a delegated administrator account targeting Amazon EC2 instances in member accounts. Use the following steps to deploy the Automation execution role in all member accounts with EC2 instances using CloudFormation StackSets.

If you want to use this automation in a single account only you must create this role in the same AWS account used in Step 1.

Open the following GitHub page and download the automationExecutionRole.yml file.

https://github.com/aws-samples/automate-vulnerability-management-and-remediation/blob/main/templates/automationExecutionRole.yaml

Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console in the Organization management account or CloudFormation delegated administrator. From the navigation pane choose StackSets. At the top of the StackSets page choose Create StackSet. Under Prerequisite – Prepare template. Choose template is ready. Under Specify template select Upload a template file choose file choose the automationExecutionRole.yml and select Next. On the Specify stack details page perform the following steps:

Set the Stack name and the Description. Set the AutomationRunPatchBaselineRunbook to the runbook that you copied in point 6 of step 2. Set the DelegatedAdministratorAccountId to the Security Hub delegated administrator account ID. If deploying in a standalone account specify the targeted account ID. Set the InstallOverrideListBucket to the S3 bucket name that you copied in point 6 of step 2.

Figure 9: CloudFormation StackSet details.

On the Configure stack options page optionally add required tags and then choose Next. On the Set deployment options page select the desired Region. Since you’re creating IAM resources you only need to specify one region and then choose Next. Review all of the information. Select I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names. Next choose Submit to submit your stack configuration. After refreshing the page the status of your StackSet should be Running. When the status changes to Succeeded proceed to the next section. You can view the outcome of the individual Stack instances under the Stack instances tab of the CloudFormation StackSet console.

Step 4: Update EC2 IAM instance roles with permissions to access the install override list S3 bucket

The Amazon EC2 instances in the target accounts must have IAM permission to the install override lists located in the S3 bucket in the Security Hub delegated administrator account. The CloudFormation template from Step 1 creates this bucket. The following section contains a sample IAM policy required for the EC2 Instance Profile definition. This policy is needed in addition to IAM policies for Systems Manager to manage the resource.

You must update the bucket’s name in the resource section of the sample policy with the install override list bucket’s name that you copied in step 2 point 6 previously. You must add this permissions policy to all of the EC2 instance roles for instances where you want the ability to remediate Amazon Inspector findings using automation.

{ ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"" ""Statement"": [{ ""Effect"": ""Allow"" ""Action"": ""s3:GetObject"" ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:s3:::NameOfInstallOverrideListBucketHere/*"" }] }

Step 5: Remediate vulnerabilities using the Security Hub custom action

Let’s walk through using the Security Hub custom action to remediate an Amazon Inspector finding associated with an Amazon EC2 instance:

In the Security Hub Delegated administrator account navigate to the Security Hub console in the Region where you deployed Step 1 and go to the findings page.

Use the Title filter in Security Hub filter match type as starts with and enter the CVE you want to remediate. Use the Resource Type filter with AwsEc2Instance to only show findings associated with Amazon EC2 instances. Once these filters are selected Security Hub will show you all of the Amazon EC2 instances affected by the CVE. Select findings that you want to remediate and run the custom action. Select Rem-Inspector-RBT if you want to reboot the Amazon EC2 instance after installing the patch. If you don’t want to reboot the Amazon EC2 instance choose Rem-Inspector-NoRBT .

Figure 10: Security Hub findings page and custom action.

Once you select the custom action you will get a notification banner confirming EventBridge receives the events. You can monitor the progress of the Automation runbook for each of the findings selected in the Systems Manager Automation console under the Executions tab as shown in the following figure.

Figure 11: Systems Manager Automation execution status.

After patching the packages the Amazon Inspector findings update to the Closed status. You can view the closed Amazon Inspector findings on the All findings page on the Amazon Inspector console. Select Closed from the drop-down as shown in the following figure.

Figure 12: Amazon Inspector console for closed finding.

The vim package-related and dependency-related findings for the Amazon EC2 instance will be remediated and closed.

The corresponding Security Hub finding record state is set to ARCHIVED  as shown in the following figure.

Figure 13: Security Hub finding record state set to Archived.

Notes

This method will only remediate Amazon Inspector Package Vulnerability findings associated with Amazon EC2 instances. It doesn’t remediate Amazon Inspector Network reachability findings or Amazon Inspector Package Vulnerability findings related to container images in Amazon ECR. You can use the custom action to remediate one Amazon Inspector finding per Amazon EC2 instance at a time. However suppose the affected package resulted in multiple findings with different CVEs for the same EC2 instance. In that case all of the findings are remediated following a successful patching operation for the affected package. If you want to remediate inspector findings at scale refer to part 2 of this blog series. You can simultaneously trigger the custom action on multiple Amazon Inspector findings associated with different Amazon EC2 instances. We recommend filtering Amazon Inspector findings with a specific CVE in Security Hub and then running the custom action on every Amazon EC2 instance with the vulnerability as shown in Figure 2. The Automation runbook installs the latest version of the affected packages and is available in the package manager repositories.

Conclusion

This post discussed how the new Amazon Inspector can help you detect vulnerabilities in Amazon EC2 instances. We reviewed why on-demand patching methods are needed to remediate zero-day and critical vulnerabilities. Finally we walked through an automation method using the Security Hub custom action to remediate Inspector findings for package vulnerabilities on selected Amazon EC2 instances affected by a specific CVE. This automation can help you reduce the operational complexity of manual updates reduce errors and increase the remediation speed.

You can use the Security Hub custom actions Rem-Inspector-RBT and Rem-Inspector-NoRBT to remediate the same vulnerability across multiple Amazon EC2 instances across an AWS Organization.

In Part 2 we’ll show you how to use the Systems Manager Automation runbook directly from the Automation console to remediate the Amazon Inspector findings for Amazon EC2 instances at scale across an AWS organization based on resource tag and Amazon Inspector finding severity.

Living in cities can be difficult. Urbanization is on the rise and congestion in the city is becoming increasingly complex every day. It creates the need to launch an automated system that allows users to book their parking slot with just a few clicks on a mobile app. Now the problem is quite apparent. But the big question is what can technology do to solve it? Is there a way out? Smart Parking System means an IoT-based system that sends data about free and residential parking areas via a web/mobile app.

Smart car parking systems using IoT which include sensors and microcontrollers can be available in each parking slot. The user will then be able to track the availability of all parking spaces and can choose the best one. Alternatively the user can also view the duration of the parking usage from the application and costs can be calculated and sent to the user with the help of smart parking meters. Not only this but the user can also decide to extend their time. All that is needed is a working internet connection.

Parking in cities: A Perennial Problem

One of the most critical problems in urban cities is car parking and traffic control systems. Finding parking space is often difficult for drivers in modern cities thanks to the growing number of private car users.

City planners can see this situation as an opportunity for IoT-based smart parking in a busy city environment to ramp up the efficiency of their parking facilities and lead to reduced search times traffic congestion and road accidents.

For instance if drivers are notified about the availability of parking spaces for their intended destination and surrounding areas parking issues and traffic congestion can be solved using smart parking using IoT technology.

Following the rapid development of sensory technology many modern cities have chosen to deploy various IoT-based systems for monitoring purposes. For example some parking programs claim that citizens get real-time information about available parking spaces with IoT smart parking systems.

Such systems require efficient sensors installed in parking lots to accommodate residential and data processing units to quickly obtain real-time data from various sources.

Some major daily parking issues include:

Lack of parking spaces mainly in the urban area Misuse of available parking spaces More time and fuel/gas are used to find open parking spaces Difficulty in finding vehicles at large parking lots Traffic congestion is concentrated on underutilized parking spaces Business parking lots are taken over by passenger parking Incorrect parking Proper management of disabled areas & unused private parking lots The natural impact of excessive fuel consumption in search of a parking space Unclear parking policies.

All these issues are a regular part of the parking experience in cities and towns across India. But that need not be the same way. Smart Parking System can solve the issue.

What is Smart Parking?

Smart parking system using IoT has smartphones and other sensors added into an interconnected system to determine parking space or level and provide real-time feedback. It is accomplished by using cameras counters on the doors or gates of parking lots sensors embedded in the paved area of ​​individual parking lots among other locations depending on the deployment.

Solutions using IoT-based parking

IoT-based smart parking system transmits available and occupied parking spaces via a web/mobile application.

Each parking space has an IoT gadget which includes sensors and microcontrollers. The user gets real-time updates on the availability of all parking spaces and therefore an option to choose the best one. This solution alone initiates a chain-reaction of benefits from lesser traffic congestion to reduced fuel efficiency in urban areas where parking is often painstaking.

A basic flowchart for the whole process of smart parking IoT looks like this:

Architecture of Smart Parking System

It consists of the following components:

Parking Sensors

The role of the parking sensors is to track space in the parking lot. Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect the presence of vehicles.

Processing Unit

The processor-on-a-chip acts as a central point between the sensors and the cloud platforms relaying data to and from.

Mobile Application

It is a visual interface for end-users to interact with the smart parking system.

The Cloud

The cloud serves as a repository for all records related to parking spaces and end-users who have access to the system.

The deployment of smart parking systems is expected to increase thanks to the rising issue of parking and reducing costs of implementing a smart parking system.

Another innovation is using visual image processing to capture a vehicle license number to identify it with the help of Optical Character Recognition technology. It then automatically opens the gate in the parking lot and the system directs the driver to the appropriate parking lot.

The future looks very promising for smart parking systems. The technologies behind this solution are IoT artificial intelligence machine learning and augmented reality. By using these new approaches smart parking will increase the efficiency of parking systems.

Applications of Smart Parking Systems using IoT

Smart cities offer better use of space less traffic clean air and more efficient public services increasing the quality of life. In addition smart cities provide many jobs and economic opportunities and strong social connections.

Smart parking IoT project will help in:

The seamless flowing of traffic

Public transport routes can be adjusted in real-time according to need and smart traffic lights systems can improve congestion.

Energy efficiency can be improved

One can easily track down the power consumption & energy consumption by monitoring in real-time.

Cities can be made safer

Cities can use technology to improve residents’ safety and improve response times with the widespread use of Wi-Fi communications and IoT technology.

Encouragement of greater citizen engagement

Citizens can respond to daily problems enabling neighbors to connect and share resources to improve communities and neighborhoods.

Conclusion

The development of the Internet of Things and cloud technology opens up new opportunities for smart cities. Smart parking has always been the backbone of building smart cities. IoT-based smart parking system offers real-time slots parking procedures information and improves users’ ability to save time on proper parking. It helps to solve growing traffic congestion concerns. As for future work users can book parking in a remote location. GPS reservations and license plate scanners can be included in the future.

At the time of his passing Aberdeen FC posted on twitter: ""The club is deeply shocked and saddened to hear that our legendary midfielder and Gothenburg Great Neale Cooper has tragically passed away.""

The combative midfielder played for Aston Villa Rangers Reading and had a second spell with the Dons throughout his career.

Cooper was in Sir Alex Ferguson’s team which beat Real Madrid 2-1 in Gothenburg in May 1983 before overcoming Hamburg later that year to clinch the European Super Cup.

The Gothenburg great also won two league winners’ medals following the Dons’ championship triumphs of 1984 and 1985.

He also won the Scottish Cup four times and League Cup once.

During his career he went onto manage Hartlepool Gillingham and Peterhead.

Aberdeen paid tribute to the talented footballer on their twitter account earlier: ""Today we remember Neale Cooper who passed away four years ago.

Never forgotten.""

Tributes have flooded in as many have taken to twitter to honour Cooper.

One commented: ""Always remembered for ‘that’ goal in 82. RIP Tattie.""

While another wrote: ""Taken far too young .. will always be in the thoughts of Aberdeen fans around the world.""

Another said: ""I was lucky enough to be in this beautiful man’s company many times. Top humble man and Dons legend. RIP Tattie.""

As many shared their fond memories of visiting chip shops that's come and gone or in fact stood the test of time an array of takeaways were listed several times in the comments.

I figured we should start with one that was deemed highly popular - Sea Salt and Sole. With three locations spanning across the Bridge of Don Cove and Dyce this chip shop received raving reviews.

From the best gluten-free options to one simply saying ""any other answer is just wrong"" it seems like this is one to be paid a visit.

Another popular choice was Torry Chipper. Racking up a lot of votes in the comments many of you noted this particular chip shop in Torry to be your favourite.

Fish and Hook on Rosemount seemed to be another highly popular choice for a fish supper. One person commented ""Fish and Hook without a doubt.""

One person even felt nostalgic for a chipper that used to be open in the seventies. He wrote: ""Don't know about nowadays but we had two both within a few hundred yards of each other as well - Earnie's greasy chips and Hass the Bass.

""Hass's was probably the first place in Aberdeen if not Scotland to sell donner kebabs in the mid-1970s. Hass the Bass was a nickname from us kids and wasn't and didn't cause any offence to Hass in the slightest. In fact he took it as an honour.""

Another commented: ""Loved Nardis chipper on a Friday my mother would give me filleted haddocks for Nardie to fry and the payment was a fry. Did any other do this?""

While someone else gave Balmedie Chipper a shoutout as they said it was ""hands down the best I've ever had.""

Someone else wrote: ""Dolphin across from justice mill does a great battered pizza.""

It is clear that many of these choices cater to more than just a fish supper too.

What do you think is the best chip shop in Aberdeen? Let us know in the comments below.",,,

The WEF’s namesake conference is widely known as an opportunity for the world’s richest and most influential people to discuss pressing political environmental and social challenges. It has not been held in person since 2020 due to Covid-19 but this week it was back in full force. This year’s chosen theme was “working together restoring trust”.

Pre-pandemic climate change had gradually been rising up the Davos agenda. At the 2020 event all business leaders and world leaders were urged by organisers to set net-zero emissions targets for 2050 at the latest.

The Covid-19 vaccination programme and the response to the economic fallout of lockdown restrictions across the world remained high on the agenda this year. Leaders were also keen to condemn Russia’s war in Ukraine and to discuss the energy price crisis and global food supply disruptions.

But the environment didn’t drop off of the agenda – 90 of the Forum’s 270 panels did include time for discussions around the climate crisis. Net-zero targets from regions and nations as of the end of 2021 covered 90% of global GDP.

So here we round up some of Davos’s major environmental announcements

Climate activists push for less talk more action to change systems

Before we get into the official announcements from nations and businesses it bears noting that climate activists staged a significant demonstration outside of the WEF event this week. Attendees held banners stating that previous editions of the talk have failed to mobilise any significant or targeted action to reduce global emissions improve climate adaptation or implement a proper loss and damage framework for the most affected groups.

Vanessa Nakate told those protesting that “many people here are disconnected from the reality [of the climate crisis]”. She added: “They are in a bubble they are in their own world”.

Youth climate activists have been calling on Davos attendees to turn talk into action more rapidly for some time. At the last face-to-face meeting in early 2020 Greta Thunberg and other Fridays for Future Participants said their demands for renewed international efforts to reduce fossil fuel supply and demand were “completely ignored”.

At this year’s conference itself climate activists invited to speak included Kenyan Elizabeth Watuthi (pictured) who urged attendees to “understand the intersections” of the climate crisis and related global challenges including food security. Some 3.1 million people in Kenya are currently in need of food assistance according to ReliefWeb following three consecutive years of dry rainfall seasons.

2. Indian CEOs form net-zero alliance

On Monday (23 May) the WEF launched the India chapter of the Alliance of CEO Climate Action Leaders. The Alliance as a whole was first founded in 2014 with the ambition of supporting businesses of all sectors to align their actions with the Paris Agreement. In line with updated science its ambition is now alignment with the Agreement’s 1.5C pathway and the transition to a net-zero world.

Before the addition of the India chapter there were some 92 companies signed up to the Alliance. The overall Alliance is co-chaired by Ingka Group boss Jesper Brodin Royal DSM boss Feike Sijbesma and Swiss Re boss Christian Mumenthaler. India’s addition should see at least a dozen more companies joining in the coming months. The India chapter is being chaired by ReNew Power’s chief executive Sumant Sinha.

The WEF said in a statement that the India chapter will “bring together the government businesses and other key stakeholders” to deliver against India’s 2070 net-zero target set last autumn.

With the India chapter the alliance now represents businesses collectively generating more emissions annually than the EU.

3. TNFD takes a step forward

Tuesday (24 May) saw the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) announcing three expansion activities to help further its quest to create a framework for companies to measure and reduce their risks relating to nature.

The Taskforce confirmed the formation of “consultation groups” of various national and regional level organisations to help increase engagement with the framework. Nations involved in these groups include Australia India the Netherlands and the UK.

It also announced a partnership Additionally the TNFD is partnering with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to engage with Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs). Over the next 12 months these organisations will inform the framework development of potential impacts and considerations that nature will have on these voices and communities.

The TNFD launched its first beta framework back in March and expects a finalised version to be launched in the second half of 2023.

Convened by @GFI_green the United Kingdom joins #TNFD as one of 6 new Consultation Groups. These market-led groups will bring together business finance public sector & civil society to discuss #nature-related issues & the beta framework Read more: https://t.co/sPg11Bmpap pic.twitter.com/oExUxeLZYq — TNFD (@TNFD_) May 26 2022

4. Transitioning Industrial Clusters towards Net-Zero initiative grows

Also on Tuesday industrial hubs in Belgium the Netherlands Texas and Ohio joined the WEF’s Transitioning Industrial Clusters towards Net Zero initiative. The aim of the initiative is to support industrial clusters in designing and delivering a transition pathway to net-zero fostering cross-industry collaboration across the world. Industrial activity is notably responsible for 30% of global annual emissions.

The new joiners doubled the number of clusters taking part in the initiative from four to eight. They are the Port of Antwerp-Bruges Brightlands Circular Space the H2Houston Hub and the Ohio Clean Hydrogen Hub Alliance.

The WEF has stated that more than a dozen additional clusters are in the process of joining the initiative. Its overarching ambition is to get at least 100 clusters signed up.

5. First Movers Coalition surpasses 50 participating companies

The big news from the private sector on Wednesday (25 May) was a major update on the First Movers Coalition – an initiative first launched during COP26 with the aim of scaling the development of low-carbon technologies for hard-to-abate sectors.

The UK Denmark India Italy Japan Norway Singapore and Sweden signed on as government partners to the Coalition which is spearheaded by the US federal government as well as the WEF.

In the private sector the Coalition opened to companies in the aluminium value chain and companies offering or interested in investing in carbon dioxide removal technologies. New joiners include Ball Corporation BHP Ecolab Enel EY FedEx Ford Motor Company HeidelbergCement National Grid PwC Schneider Electric Swiss Re and Vestas. Companies participating in the Coalition now represent more than $8.5trn of market capitalisation.

We will only reach net-zero if we bring disruptive cleantech to market at scale. Today @Google joins the #FirstMoversCoalition at #wef22 alongside @JohnKerry to decarbonize the hardest-to-abate sectors of the economy. Read more.https://t.co/4dmHPpqwKQ — Kate Brandt (@KateEBrandt) May 25 2022

6. Businesses pledge to co-create shared low-carbon urban mobility networks

On Thursday (26 May) more than 30 companies pledged to collaborate with each other and with national regional and local policymakers to create “shared connected and decarbonized mobility ecosystems”.

The Urban Mobility Scorecards initiative will assess how cities across the world are performing in terms of the environmental sustainability and resilience of their mobility networks. These assessments will be completed this year and will serve as baselines against which cities can collaborate with key stakeholder groups to design and deliver targeted changes.

Businesses supporting the initiative include Uber Hyundai Volta Trucks and Visa.

7. Spotlight shone on water resources

Also on Thursday a new Global Commission on the Economics of Water was formally launched. Much like the natural capital movement which has sought to incorporate the value of nature into policymaking and financial decision-making the Commission will seek to redefine how water is valued and ensure that this value is taken into account when major decisions are taken in the private and public sectors.

The WEF and the Dutch Government have selected World Trade Organisation director-general by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to co-lead the Commission alongside the UCL Institutte for Innovation and Public Purpose Mariana Mazzucato; Singapore’s Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research’s director Johan Rockström.

Separately the WEF announced a new $15m fund that will invest in those developing innovative solutions in the field of freshwater resource management. The fund will be managed by the WEF’s open innovation platform uplink with support from IT giant HCL Technologies and will be spent across a five-year period.

The UN estimates that the global demand for water will exceed sustainable supply by 40% by 2030. Contributing megatrends include population growth the global temperature increase changing weather patterns and the over-exploitation of natural resources by the private sector.",,,,,,,,,
BAC,Bank of America,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLXdvbnQtYmUtcnVzaGluZy1pbnRvLWNyeXB0by1hbnl0aW1lLXNvb24tMTgwMDQzMDk1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Bank of America won't be rushing into crypto anytime soon,"DAVOS Switzerland — The crypto faithful shouldn't expect Bank of America to make a major push into the sector anytime soon.

""No"" replied Bank of America CEO Brian T. Moynihan when Yahoo Finance Live asked him at the World Economic Forum whether he felt like the company was missing out on the next big thing by not aggressively moving into crypto (full interview above).

Moynihan — who has driven a major digital banking transformation as BofA's CEO for the last 12 years — explained the bank is heavily regulated and that prevents an all-in maneuver into crypto.

The banking industry veteran also said that it's more fruitful for BofA to continue to focus on what it does — being a bank and encouraging financial freedom.

""Our big thing is helping consumers in America have a successful financial life"" Moynihan said. ""Our life plans financial planning tool— four or five million users— only started three years ago. That's what you need to do is get people to learn how to make their money work more for them to help in their lives.""

Despite crypto's relatively robust presence at the World Economic Forum via various after-parties and the attendance of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and FTX President Brett Harrison there remained a heavy skepticism on the digital currency among those Yahoo Finance spoke with.

The recent news is not pretty: Bitcoin's price recently fell below $30000 amid a broader rout in all things tech shares of companies that trade crypto such as Coinbase and Robinhood have been hammered and the recent collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin felt like a watershed moment to many observers.

Amid the carnage Guggenheim's Scott Minerd told Bloomberg bitcoin could plunge to $8000 and there were now a bunch of ""yahoos"" in the sector.

It comes at a volatile time for markets. After weeks of losses the S & P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average scored big gains last week. The Dow finished up 6.2% snapping an eight week losing streak. The S & P 500 ended the week 6.5% higher and the Nasdaq finished up 6.8% on the week both indexes ending seven-week losing streaks.

""In our Screen of the Week we highlight High Quality stocks that have derated more than the market YTD [year to date] but have stronger earnings support and higher-than-sector median FCF [free cashflow]"" analyst Paulina Strzelinska said. Top of the bank's list — ranked in order of quality — was Swiss industrials company Kuehne Nagel  followed by Danish jewelry brand Pandora and Italian health care company DiaSorin . Shipping firm Maersk  British-American heating firm Ferguson and automaker Stellantis came next followed by luxury apparel brand Moncler  IT consultancy Reply and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey . ""High Quality stocks have seen the largest drop in valuation versus other styles with the premium falling to the lowest level in four years"" Strzelinska added. JPMorgan's opportunities JPMorgan said that the retail sector has potentially hit the bottom. ""Retailers followed consumer confidence lower but this could be as bad as it gets"" its analysts wrote in a research note dated May 23.

Retail names on the bank's list of top European picks included Marks and Spencer and Swedish clothing company H & M  both of which JPMorgan rated neutral. Also on its list is Portuguese grocery group Jeronimo Martins  which it rated overweight. The bank also said consumer spending is likely to be ""relatively resilient.""

The bank analyzed 18 indicators — that could become ""red flags"" — such as company fundamentals equity valuation and financing activity as part of its Bear Market Checklist or BMC. ""At any one time some of these might be giving warning signs but usually not enough to suggest turning long-term bearish"" the analysts led by Robert Buckland stated. Citi did not pick stocks but said it preferred Europe or emerging markets because the number of red flags in those regions are currently lower than in the U.S. ""The European BMC looked less frothy at the end of last year at just 6/18 red flags. Notably valuations were not especially extended unlike the US. The European BMC is now down to just 4.5/18 red flags. We use different factors in the EM BMC but the story is similar to Europe. For those investors concerned it is too early to take the plunge in the US market maybe buying the dips in Europe and EM is a safer call"" the bank stated. ""The BMC was never intended to be a market timing tool to predict when the next correction might start or end. Instead it was designed to suggest action when the inevitable dips come along"" the bank noted. - CNBC's Fred Imbert and Tanaya Macheel contributed to this report.

Handling money is just one part of Poverello’s year-long men’s rehab program which includes six months of aftercare in a transitional living facility.

Financial literacy is important because program graduates exit with almost $20000 in earnings.

However history indicates that some of the graduates won’t make it very far before they’re back in the program with no money to their name.

To prevent this cycle Poverello House is now relying on Bank of America’s Better Money Habits program to instruct participants on making sound financial choices.

Brett Lucky a Poverello resident just started the rehab program. He says his goal is to be able to stand on his own two feet when he leaves.

“Like most people I want to pay for my own car. I want to buy a house eventually” said Lucky.

“But really I just want to be confident that I can handle the finances on my own and be able to breathe without that extra stress of where I’m going to pay my bills and how that’s going to work out at the end of the week or the end of the month and not have to stress all that much about that kind of thing.”

Men’s Rehab Program Helps Men Get Back on Their Feet

Gavin Larson who is a job developer and case manager for the Poverello House oversees many of the men in the program.

He says all the men are assigned a role that plays a big part in Poverello’s daily operations.

“All the guys that are cooking the food all the guys that are performing security working in the warehouse driving deliveries picking up deliveries and donations they’re all program participants” said Larson.

“We go over substance-use disorder we do the 12 steps of AA and we have group therapy for mental health.”

Larson says the program is multifaceted with several resources offered to help the men.

However he says an often overlooked topic has been the program’s final step — the financial literacy portion.

In the past Larson was teaching residents a few basic financial skills until Bank of America stepped to the plate by offering to teach classes every three months.

“It’s really invaluable you know to see bankers come down and give that class and so I know from my humble standpoint we’re really grateful to Bank of America” said Larson.

“In the past they’ve (Bank of America) been a financial supporter one of our sponsors and a partner in a lot of ways. So to make that trip and really put in the time for our guys is very special.”

What Do Program Participants Learn?

The volunteers show the men how to open a bank account understand a paycheck manage a strict budget and repay debt.

Marisa Moore the bank’s local market executive for Fresno and Visalia says once they finish teaching the basics later sessions focus on planning for large purchases such as a car and a home and saving for retirement.

“In talking to all of our volunteers the guys have been super engaged the entire time asking questions and really wanting to learn” said Moore. “I feel that they’re taking it very seriously and that they will apply a lot of what they’re learning to their own lives today and when they leave the Poverello House.”

One of the students Felipe Barrajas said he was excited to learn about saving because his goal is to own a house.

“I’ve learned how important it is to save money and how to budget” said Barrajas. “I’ve also learned to look out for fraud and be aware of what I spend.”

Making it Out of the Program Isn’t Always Easy

Larson says making it out of the program is not always easy but Poverello House focuses on building a community where participants are always welcomed back.

“I think one of the main things is the rehab program is tough it’s not easy” said Larson.

Once residents make it past the first two or three weeks Larson says many of the participants deeply commit to change and recovery.

“At that point you know they’re squeezing every drop of information every resource they can out of this place” said Larson.

Past participants facing difficult challenges often feel comfortable coming back to ask for help says Larson.

“I have guys that come from two years ago and say hey man I just got laid off. Can I work with you?” said Larson. “Anybody who is an alumni of our program can come back.”

Bank of America Resources

While the Better Money Habits program is taught at schools colleges and recovery resource centers Bank of America also offers these same resources to the public.

Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video. ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

""Twenty pounds of Epsom salt in a bath"" she said before dumping the bags into a bath. ""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

Wednesday's opening celebrates the redevelopment of the former YMCA building on the corner of Summer and Front streets.

This construction project will add 50 new units to the development for a total of 60 apartments 42 of them considered affordable.

The complex is for seniors and the units range in price from $800 to $1500 depending on the income of the tenant.

This project is owned and operated by the Szanton Company and Bath Housing is celebrating their work saying Bath is no exception to the state's housing crisis.

“We see a lot of people come through our office that are rent-burdened” Bath Housing Executive Director Debora Keller said. “They are paying 60 70 80 percent of their rent their income for rent and a project like this which aligns your rent to your income levels is really valuable and gives people the cushion they need to thrive as they get older.”

The property manager of the Bath development says the building is at 100 percent pre-occupancy and the company is excited to welcome in those tenants Wednesday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Often You Should Change Your Bath Towel,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533D638280>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jdC8yMDI0L2FwcmlsLXdlYi1vbmx5L2phenptZW4tbG91aXMtYXJtc3Ryb25nLWR1a2UtZWxsaW5ndG9uLWNvdW50LWJhc2llLXR5ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke Ellington Read His Bible in the Bath,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jdC8yMDI0L2FwcmlsLXdlYi1vbmx5L2phenptZW4tbG91aXMtYXJtc3Ryb25nLWR1a2UtZWxsaW5ndG9uLWNvdW50LWJhc2llLXR5ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533D63BA90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jdC8yMDI0L2FwcmlsLXdlYi1vbmx5L2phenptZW4tbG91aXMtYXJtc3Ryb25nLWR1a2UtZWxsaW5ndG9uLWNvdW50LWJhc2llLXR5ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

BRK-B,Berkshire Hathaway,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA1LzI4L2lmLWktY291bGQtb25seS1idXktMS1zdG9jay10aGlzLXdvdWxkLWJlLWl0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If I Could Only Buy 1 Stock This Would Be It,"Berkshire Hathaway stock has a long history of beating the market and is well-positioned to outperform in the future.

Generally it's a bad idea for an investor to buy only one stock. The Motley Fool suggests you should aim for a portfolio of at least 25 stocks to protect yourself against extreme volatility in any particular stock. With that said Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) the nearly $700 billion holding company could be considered the exception to the rule. Here are three reasons why Berkshire Hathaway would be my choice if I could only buy one stock.

Reason one: A portfolio unlike any other

As a holding company Berkshire owns a majority stake in over 60 subsidiaries ranging from insurance companies like Geico to consumer favorites like Dairy Queen and See's Candies. Berkshire currently holds stock in over 40 publicly traded companies across the energy consumer goods and fintech sectors.

However despite what appears to be a heavily diversified stock portfolio certain positions are much more concentrated than others. CEO Warren Buffett once famously said ""Diversification as practiced generally makes very little sense for anyone that knows what they're doing...[it] is a protection against ignorance."" Buffett practices what he preaches so over 40% of Berkshire's $360 billion-plus portfolio is in Apple stock. And only five companies make up about 75% of Berkshire's managed holdings.

Reason two: A history of beating the market

With its unique portfolio Berkshire Hathaway stock doesn't typically track the performance of an index fund like the S&P 500; it crushes it. In a year like 2022 when the stock market is down 15% Berkshire's stock is up about 3%. Additionally Berkshire is outperforming the S&P 500 with dividends included on a one- three- and five-year basis.

Since Warren Buffett took the helm at Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 the company has produced a 20.1% compound annual gain nearly doubling the S&P 500's 10.5% compound annual return during the same time period.

So while past performance doesn't necessarily predict future results Berkshire Hathaway has proven time and time again that it's well-positioned to outperform the market.

Reason three: A mountain of cash

With Berkshire's insurance business the company receives premiums from its customers upfront. This cash -- called ""the float"" -- is theirs to invest until policyholders' claims deplete it. As a result Berkshire currently has $106 billion in cash to deploy for stock investments. So despite recent interest rate hikes where many companies will have to pay more to borrow money Berkshire's cash hoard insulates the company from needing to borrow money at higher rates.

And as previously mentioned the stock market is down 17% in 2022 meaning Berkshire can invest in companies at deflated prices. That played out in the first quarter of 2022 when Berkshire deployed $51 billion after years of doing very little with its outsized cash position. Buffett has previously stated he will never let Berkshire's float fall below $30 billion which still leaves plenty of room for him to invest more money.

The bottom line

Beyond these reasons why Berkshire Hathaway is a stock worth buying what if I told you the greatest investor of the last 75 years is buying the stock at a historic rate? That's right; Warren Buffett directed Berkshire Hathaway to repurchase $51.7 billion in stock or roughly 9% of the company's shares outstanding since year-end 2019.

Look to Berkshire Hathaway's next 13F -- a quarterly report that discloses a holding company's stock positions -- to see if the company put more of its pile of cash to work to take advantage of the down market. Alternatively Buffett could just continue buying back Berkshire stock. Either way the company is well-positioned to outperform the market -- just as it has done throughout Buffett's tenure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1ib3VnaHQtbmVhcmx5LTUtMTEwMDAwNzY0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett bought nearly $5 billion worth of HP shares ⁠— here's why you might want to ride his coattails,"Warren Buffett bought nearly $5 billion worth of HP shares ⁠— here's why you might want to ride his coattails

Warren Buffett isn’t known for being a technology investor.

In his 2014 letter to shareholders Buffett wrote that he prefers “simple businesses” and added that “if there’s lots of technology we won’t understand it.”

But in recent years the Oracle of Omaha has warmed up a bit to the tech space. His holding company Berkshire Hathaway started buying Apple in 2016. Now the iPhone giant is the largest public holding in its portfolio.

Just last month Berkshire revealed that it had purchased 121 million shares of PC and printer hardware company HP (HPQ) a stake worth nearly $4.7 billion at today’s prices.

Let’s quickly dig into the move and figure out if following Buffett into HP makes sense for investors.

An unexpected shopping spree

Berkshire’s cash pile grew to a near-record $146.7 billion at the end of 2021 largely because Buffett found little that excited him. He is a value investor after all and U.S. stock market valuations were bloated up until a few months ago.

But based on his company’s recent moves it's clear that Buffett now sees opportunity in the market.

In March Berkshire snapped up over 136 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY) representing nearly 15% of the integrated oil and gas giant’s total shares outstanding.

Later in the month Berkshire reached an agreement to buy insurance company Alleghany for $11.6 billion.

And now by loading up 121 million shares of HP Berkshire has become its largest shareholder with an 11.4% stake.

A fast-growing company

With a market cap of around $41 billion HP isn’t nearly as big as Buffett’s other major tech holding Apple. But it’s one of the leading players in the PC industry.

And business is not standing still.

In HP’s fiscal Q1 revenue grew 8.8% year over year to $17 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.10 up 19.6% from the year-ago period and well above management’s prior outlook.

In March HP announced that it would acquire video and voice solutions company Poly in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.3 billion. The move should accelerate HP’s growth strategy helping it build a leading portfolio of hybrid work solutions.

The company is returning cash to investors too. HP pays quarterly dividends of 25 cents per share translating to a decent annual yield of 2.6%.

It’s also buying back its shares: In fiscal Q1 HP spent $1.5 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 42.6 million shares of common stock.

Buffett loves cheap stocks

Due to growing investor interest many tech stocks have rallied significantly in recent years pushing their valuations to uncomfortably high levels.

Story continues

However HP remains relatively cheap a characteristic that Buffett loves to see in his investment purchases.

Despite the multi-year rally in tech HP has a price-to-earnings ratio of 7. That’s not only substantially lower than the S&P 500’s average P/E of 21 but also below the company’s own five-year average P/E of 10.

Given Wall Street’s positive reaction to the investment — both HP and Berkshire shares are up nicely since the announcement — following Buffett’s coattails might not be a bad idea.

“We view Berkshire buying HPQ shares as a positive that validates HPQ’s strategy/deep value” writes Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani in a note to investors.

In fact she’s well known in the crypto space as a working artist who makes and sells NFTs or non-fungible tokens of her work. Nicole was even included on Fortune’s NFTy 50 list which ranks the most influential players on the scene.

To her NFTs and the underlying blockchain technology are “super incredible.”

“For me it’s a means to making my work and sharing my work in a new context” she told Fortune. “I’m not a technologist. I’m not a financial expert. But I love that basically art is becoming its own currency” with NFTs Nicole said. “What’s interesting is it’s not just a piece of art it is a currency and it’s also a technology.”

NFTs are digital assets—from art to music to other collectibles and more—represented as tokens on the blockchain. Each can be bought sold or held with ownership and validity tracked.

To Nicole who is in her mid-40s NFTs bring “artists technologists and financial people together.”

Enter her grandfather Warren. “He’s happy I’m doing so well” Nicole said mentioning a recent email he sent her saying so. “I think the place in which my grandfather would be able to celebrate NFTs and crypto would be that it supports artists. We come from a family of artists.”

Besides Warren’s well-documented dislike hatred even of crypto he and his granddaughter had a reported falling out decades ago when she was in her 20s. She told Fortune both of these are misunderstood.

Yes Nicole allows “he has issues with crypto but I don’t think he has any issues with artists being contributors. He’s an art appreciator and my family are all art appreciators.”

She also emphasizes that her past disagreements with her grandfather should remain in the past and talks of reconciliation. “He is happy that I’m finding a way to support myself and exchange what I have to create in this world in the marketplace” she said. “I think that he respects that. I think that he of all people appreciates authenticity integrity and hard work. Those qualities go hand-in-hand with who an artist is and what an artist brings to our world.”

‘I’ve never been into Wall Street and stocks’

Nicole added that while the “Wall Street vs. crypto” narrative gets a lot of air she doesn’t feel that’s an accurate representation of the digital asset space. She sees the two as complementary to each other saying “crypto and the new economy that’s being created is incredibly important and vital to the dollar and our actual economy.”

Unlike her grandfather “I’ve never been into Wall Street and stocks probably because there wasn’t really the art component” she said. Now with NFTs she’s found an interest and understanding of stocks and what an asset really means “because I can relate to it now” she said.

“I’m following in the lineage of my grandfather in that I’m all about value creation” Nicole says except for her that’s in the art currency of NFTs.

She said she feels very fortunate and privileged to have grown up having the “Buffett” name but at the same time “I’m wildly independent. I’m not afraid to stand on my own two feet.”

‘We have an opportunity to do things differently’

Nicole began selling NFTs of her abstract paintings in early 2021. Her genesis collection Spirit Coins has over $83000 in volume on NFT marketplace OpenSea at current prices. Each sells for a floor or minimum price of $3342.

Since then she’s created more collections with the same zen vibe.

Nicole has also partnered with organizations such as the Open Earth Foundation Hope for Haiti and Blankets of Hope donating a percentage—or sometimes all—of her proceeds she said. She recognizes that NFTs are criticized for their environmental impact among other things but hopes her giving back through her NFT sales can counterbalance it. She declined to share her NFT earnings with Fortune.

Despite the downturn in the crypto market Nicole remains hopeful for the future. And even though NFTs can offer a new stream of income and opportunity for artists things have been far from perfect in the space especially in 2022. Notwithstanding the crypto crash that has touched most areas of decentralized finance NFTs have high barriers to entry sometimes high gas fees to mint and other difficulties. But Nicole sees value in it.

“I think that if people keep an open mind and understand that NFTs have so much more capacity for positive than any of the negative downsides—which is yes it’s pulling from our environmental resources—there’s a lot of capacity for people to raise money and capital for environmental causes” she said. “There’s immense responsibility in this space to bring attention to environmental causes. This is new and because it’s new we have an opportunity to do things differently.”

YouTuber Bearded Tesla Guy outlined his thoughts in his latest video.

He first discussed his own situation. He's looking to buy a new Model 3 and is open to all three options: the entry-level $46990 RWD the $55990 mid-trim Long Range and top-of-the-line $62990 Performance. The base Model 3 now features an LFP battery and has a seriously impressive 267-mile estimated EPA range as a result. It's RWD so handles well and is rather engaging to drive. However in rougher weather conditions the lack of AWD could be a problem plus for road trips you'll have to charge more often (although I reiterate 267 miles of EPA range is still quite good and more than most affordable EVs get).

For an extra $9000 you can have the Long Range. This gives you AWD a 334-mile estimated EPA range and a marginally quicker 0-60 mph time (the RWD's 5.8 seconds falls to 4.2 in the LR). However as mentioned it is an extra $9000. Given the RWD already has plenty of range and is more than quick enough for most is the Long Range worth almost $60k? Unless you live in an area prone to heavy snowfall I'm not convinced.

Finally there's the Model 3 Performance. Although it's by far the priciest of the trio few cars offer equivalent levels of power and speed for under $70000.

Although Bearded Tesla Guy didn't get into which Model 3 he reckons is best to buy personally I think if it's only going to be your second car and/or you don't frequently drive long distances the RWD makes the most sense. It gets the same equipment as the Long Range and Performance and only loses out slightly on range. Perhaps if you're really into driving and can afford it the Performance is your best bet.

But personally I'd save the cash and get the base Model 3 or (if you're open to non-Tesla EVs) look at a Long Range Single-Motor Polestar 2 which can be had for just $40900 after the FTC and offers slightly more range than the RWD Model 3. That said when it comes to Model 3 trims the RWD is plenty quick and has more range than the majority of sub $50k EVs currently on sale.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vY29yYWxzcHJpbmdzdGFsay5jb20vY29yYWwtbGFuZGluZ3Mtc2hvcHBpbmctY2VudGVyLXNvbGQtNDAzMTjSAUpodHRwczovL2NvcmFsc3ByaW5nc3RhbGsuY29tL2NvcmFsLWxhbmRpbmdzLXNob3BwaW5nLWNlbnRlci1zb2xkLTQwMzE4L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coral Landings III Shopping Center Sells For $37 Million • Coral Springs Talk,"Share Tweet reddit Whatsapp

You'll need these strategies and some luck,"At a property showing earlier this month on Lake Vermilion near Tower Minn. real estate agent Lisa Janisch hustled her clients into the lower level of the home as a spring storm blew in.

Shingles sheared from the roof trees toppled and sheets of ice pushed ashore on the still-partly frozen lake. The house was damaged but her clients were safe.

Lake home buyers in Minnesota and Wisconsin are facing another challenge that doesn't pass as quickly as a thunderstorm: There are simply very few homes for sale.

New listings in popular parts of the state for lakeshore buyers have dwindled dramatically. In Aitkin County there were only 27 listings last month 29% fewer than last year. In Cook County the arrowhead on the North Shore there were just seven listings less than half the year-ago number.

So what's a buyer to do?

The first step is identifying the area where you want to spend your weekends and deciding what kind of lake you want to buy on.

Then find an agent who knows those lakes and is well connected in the area so they're familiar with what's on the market and what's soon to come. In this case probably best not to hire an agent who specializes only in the metro even if you've worked with them before. Maybe they can provide a referral.

""Do some research and interview a few agents who actually work in the area you are buying into"" said Janisch who specializes in lake home listings from the Iron Range to the North Shore of Lake Superior. ""Finding the right property begins with finding the right agent that you can trust.""

Buyers should be wary of paid referrals from other agents. ""It might get you an inexperienced agent who was willing to pay the highest referral fee"" she said.

This year more than ever it's imperative to be the first to know about listings when they're about to hit the market.

When to shop

Memorial Day is traditionally the time when people start actively shopping for a cabin. It's when the ice is finally off the lakes and the forests have yet to become unpassable thickets making it easier to see the contours of the land. People who wait until late summer to shop are often not able to get a sense of seasonal views.

Since the pandemic however buyers have been on the hunt year-round. Winter shoppers should know that it'll be more difficult to evaluate a beach water quality and the potential for views to be obscured during summer.

""Shopping at different times a year will allow you to see the property in different seasons"" Janisch said.

Dan Pflugshaupt a broker/owner whose market ranges from Little Falls to Bena said buyers also need to think about when they want to close on a sale. If it's important to be unpacked in your new lakeshore home in time for the fishing opener you'll need to have a signed purchase in hand by March or early April.

How to shop

It used to be that finding a lake home meant a field trip to the place you want to buy to meet local agents and find local listings. Today however the vast majority of all rural real estate agents and their brokers including those in rural areas now feed their listings to all the major real estate websites.

There are are a handful of brokerages and websites that specialize in lake homes cabins and hunting. In Minnesota and Wisconsin one of the most prominent is Lakeplace.com. It's not only an aggregator of homes cabins and other rural properties it also lists resorts and vacation rentals. And the company operates its own branded offices in some of the most popular lakeshore areas in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Many real estate agents say the best way to find the hottest listings is to simply stay connected to local agents.

""They often know about properties that are not on the market in any way"" Janisch said. ""They have most likely been talking to sellers who might be considering selling but haven't taken the step yet.""

See it yourself

Because many lakeshore buyers these days lose bidding wars or shop from far away a growing number are making offers sight unseen said Pflugshaupt who's facilitated more sales than any agent during the last year at Lakeplace.com.

But when it comes to lakeshore properties pictures are not worth a thousand words he added.

""The setting elevation to the lake and lakeshore quality are usually important and cannot be portrayed with pictures"" he said. ""They need to be seen in person.""

Most buyers he said want a level sandy shoreline studded with pine trees. And even though a listing description might promise such features those kinds of properties are few and far between he said. If you find one you're going to pay a premium.

""Level-sand shoreline lot is less than 5% on average of any given lake"" he said. ""Make a list of your priorities and your budget. Many times a buyer will need to make compromises on one to get the other.""

Don't dawdle

The biggest mistake most lakeshore buyers make Janisch said is waiting for the absolute perfect property and missing a year or more of making memories.

At the same time she said buyers need to be thoughtful about how they want to use the cabin and the lake. And that means carefully considering whether the property will support the lifestyle they imagine.

Pflugshaupt said buyers shouldn't overlook small lakes. The advantage of smaller lakes he said is that often they don't have a public access which will reduce the amount of boat traffic and limit the chances that invasive species will get in. He said his family lives on a smaller lake that even on July 4 is mostly free of boats.

""They are often top-notch fishing lakes with little pressure and are many times very quiet and peaceful"" he said.

Buyers who care about fishing on bigger waters might be better served by getting a second boat to use on that kind of lake. ""You can buy a used boat for $6000"" he said.

Other considerations

On a budget? It's still possible to get that cozy cabin on a lake for less than $300000 but it's going to be a seasonal cabin on a smaller lake with likely more marginal shoreline. If you're looking for something a little bit more upscale but can't afford the prices they command these days a growing number of buyers are shopping for properties with shared shoreline. Fractional ownership is also a more affordable option. In those cases multiple people own a share of the property and agree on a schedule for using it.

Want to WFC? Since the pandemic agents say the very first question most buyers ask is whether the property has internet. Signal speed is very important as well if you're planning to work-from-cabin. You can quickly find out more by contacting the local telecommunications provider. In most rural areas there's only one.

Financing your cabin? If you're getting a mortgage it's typically best to check with a local lender who has experience financing other properties in that area. This is especially crucial if it's a seasonal property that might not be a consideration for most big lenders or metro-area mortgage companies."

What About Guns?

But not everyone will have to wait until then. On June 1 when the shareholders of the Connecticut-based gun maker Sturm Ruger log in to the company’s virtual annual meeting they can vote on a shareholder proposal that states because of “the inherent lethality of firearms” Ruger must hire an outside firm to study its impact on human rights “above and beyond legal and regulatory matters.”

The human rights study is an unlikely crusade at Ruger similar to an effort at Smith & Wesson another rare publicly traded gun company in a largely privately owned and opaque industry. The nonbinding proposals pit a nun who is leading one activist group and a hospital executive leading another against gun makers who have so far been unwilling to compromise.

Head of the BI Communications Department Erwin Haryono said the LCS system allows Indonesia to use the rupiah currency in international transactions as well as being useful for creating stability in the rupiah exchange rate.

""LCS is also beneficial for the business world in providing natural hedges to protect against exchange rate exposure creating cheaper and more efficient transaction costs through direct rates as well as faster fund transfers"" he said in a press statement quoted on Saturday May 28.

Erwin explained the development of LCS transactions has been implemented since 2018 and now includes several countries to cooperate namely Malaysia Thailand Japan and China.

""The contribution of these four countries has driven a positive trend of LCS growth in the financial market reaching 868 million US dollars in the first quarter of 2022"" he said.

Meanwhile the LCS National Task Force program series consists of three things. First targeted socialization to increase awareness and understanding for business actors. Second carry out regulatory reforms by creating accommodative rules.

And the third is to encourage breakthroughs in the form of incentives facilitation and acceleration of services that support LCS.

""The LCS National Task Force is ready to develop accelerate and expand the use of Local Currency Settlement to support financial system stability and accelerate national economic recovery"" Erwin concluded."

NUMBER 1

JANUARY 1937

BY A. EDWARD NEWTON

[ON the occasion of receiving his Doctorate of Laws Mr. Newton presented to the University of Pennsylvania a first edition of the great Blackstone in whose honor he made the address which follows. — THE EDITORS]

I

THIS is an important day in the lives of all of us in this auditorium. For you who are being graduated a great university has done all that it could to fit you for the world — it is a debt that you can only repay by being true to her and to her traditions. I would not have you think that the world is waiting for you. You will find it in Shakespeare’s phrase an oyster but one that will not open readily — it never did so open. Everyone must open it for himself.

I have recently been reading old Montaigne. The French essayist died in 1592. Shakespeare had not then written his greatest plays yet Montaigne was complaining that the world had seen its best days that things were not as they used to be; and he believed it too for an honester man than Montaigne never lived. The English have a comic weekly Punch — it has been functioning now for almost a hundred years; someone said long ago that it is not as good as it used to be — to be met by the rejoinder that it never was. There will be cakes and ale again — and ginger hot in the mouth too. I have had mine and you will get yours and enjoy them but you must be patient diligent and not too easily discouraged. A famous philosopher once said that most apprehension is needless pain that the things we fear most never happen. There was a song sung by some of us during the war the refrain of which was ‘It’s a terrible terrible terrible war still it’s better than no war at all.’ And so I say of the world. But in the words of Walt Whitman ‘I sing myself.’

Several years ago I received an invitation from a person unknown asking me to be the guest of honor upon the occasion of the annual gambol of the Presbyterian ministers of Philadelphia and vicinity. I was to address them upon any subject that might be agreeable to me. I replied very pertly — as is my habit I fear — that I must decline the invitation; adding that they would not care to hear my opinion of ministers in general and of Presbyterian ministers in particular. I supposed that that would settle the matter but not so. Instantly came a reply. ‘Splendid! ’ it said. ‘We now insist upon having you tell us your opinion of Presbyterian ministers; it will be great fun.’ How could I decline? And upon this text I spake. I found the ministers to be capital fellows — when not working at their jobs — and a good time was had by all. And in the same humor I shall make my Commentary upon Blackstone.

Copyright 1936 by The Atlantic Monthly Company Boston Mass All rights reserved.

But first may I say how fully I endorse all that has been said as to my merits? They have been if anything understated. (Turning to the President of the University) You will be pleased to know my Lud that the proposed action of your honorable self and your Trustees meets with general approval. I am not I hope betraying confidence when I say that I have received an anonymous letter signed by all of the leading members of the Bench and Bar of Philadelphia endorsing the action of your Board. This gives me courage further to address you.

When several months ago you did me the honor of informing me that it was the intention of the University to confer upon me the degree of Doctor of Laws I feared myself unworthy of such distinction: I feared that like the Clown in Twelfth Night I might be thought a dissembler in this gown for I am not tall enough to become the function well nor am I lean enough to be thought a good student. But as Dr. Johnson said when he was praised by his King it is not for me to bandy civilities with my sovereign and I shall endeavor to prove worthy of the honor you do me. When I become a little more accustomed to the rôle I shall henceforth play in the world I shall I hope be able to speak without notes but at this moment conscious that there must be no fumbling in the message that I am privileged to deliver to this distinguished audience I permit myself the use of pen ink and paper — toys play with which I have indulged myself for many years and more dangerous than most.

Lawyers my Lud together with soothsayers prophets preachers and physicians are among the learned professions which compel the respect and admiration of society. They form a great trades-union of which you are about to make me a member and I thank you for the honor. I am not blind to the fact that as in a nation of one-eyed men a two-eyed man is king so by the mere process of being able to read the members of this union first secured their exalted position. With the passage of time came wealth and increase of dignity so that to-day the members of this band this guild this brotherhood do not hesitate to announce to the world their importance by adorning themselves in costly and gayly colored robes that by their magnificence they may stun the imagination of those who come to them for succor or for advice. Looking at the portraits of the famous Chief Justices and Lord Chancellors which adorn the walls of the National Portrait Gallery in London I sometimes ask myself whether these men were aware that their air severe was but a mere — veneer; an affectation born of a morbid love of admiration.

There in the front row before me sits my friend Dr. Tait McKenzie the distinguished sculptor — looking like a scarlet woman in the robes of the University of McGill. If fine feathers make fine birds as we are told they do then Tait is the finest bird in this auditorium. I envy him his plumage. In England too whence many of our legal customs come lawyers do not disdain to cover their heads with a thatch usually called a wig now made of the tails and manes of horses. Wigs were introduced in courts of justice in 1670 but something over a century ago a wigmaker invented the modern article composed of horsehair in the proportion of five white strands to one of black. The advantage of this type is that it retains its curl without grease and requires no powder. It is commonly thought that a head which can wear a wig can hardly fail in the matter of wisdom and it is a matter of keen regret to me that the great university which has seen fit so signally to honor me has not provided me with one: it is for this reason that I appear before you if not exactly baldheaded yet lacking somewhat in the appearance of dignity and wisdom. You will recall sir that Charles James Fox looking at a portrait of Lord Chancellor Thurlow his full-bottom wig falling bountifully to his shoulders and giving him that appearance of sagacity for which he is remembered observed ‘No man ever was so wise as Thurlow looks.’ And but for the unimpeachable integrity of Charles Lamb we might well doubt his observation that ‘lawyers were children once.’

We have it upon the authority of Shakespeare that apparel oft proclaims the man; without the trappings of office a man is after all but a forked radish. As such — man not radish — I venture very respectfully to address you. And even you my Lud who have forsaken the uphill road of the man of affairs for the primrose path of the college president — even you sir distinguished as you look to-day in the panoply of your high office how think you do you appear in the eyes of your wife appareled in bed-smock and nightcap? A judge may let fly the thunderbolts of the law from the bench but his decrees do not run in the bedchamber. However it would ill become me to pursue this subject further.

II

I have been moved to inquire sir what is this science called the Law? It is not enough to call her a jealous mistress; she is something more than that. Gibbon who in a few terse words summed up all history as a register of the crimes follies and misfortunes of mankind was equally exact in describing the law: he called it a mysterious science and a profitable trade. In England it was merely necessary to eat twelve dinners in a foreordained place and company to become ipso facto entitled to be called to the bar in addition to which it was important for a lawyer to bear the port charge and countenance of a gentleman; but today and in this country a certain amount of actual study is required. One critic has said that whoever wishes to attain a style elegant but unostentatious must give his days and nights to the luminous pages of Addison. May I not paraphrase the famous remark of Sheridan and say that he who would comprehend the law must devote his days and nights to the voluminous volumes of Blackstone?

I have done so my Lud and I find that there are three main divisions of the law: common or garden law which seems to be made rather by the sun and shade than by the reasoning of man; equity which the learned John Selden said depended upon the length of the Lord Chancellor’s foot; and international law which is a device made of sand painted to look like iron but which invariably falls to pieces when subjected to the use for which it is designed. These three branches are capable of many subdivisions and to these may be added a speedy and effective form of law invented by one Judge Lynch. The use of this law is however frowned upon by old-time practitioners as tending to deprive them of the emoluments of the profession which has been so aptly described by the great historian as a profitable trade.

From time immemorial the followers of well-defined and recognized trades have assembled themselves into groups or guilds and a few centuries ago in London they began to build halls or meeting places in which their mysterious and secret rites might be carried on without molestation. Thus we have to-day the Goldsmiths’ Hall the Fishmongers’ the Ironmongers’ the Cloth-workers’ the Surgeon-Barbers’ and many others. In time these guilds became rich powerful and arrogant; admission into them came to be and still is regarded as an honor so natural is it for a man to seek to rise above his fellows. For as the song says: —

When everyone is soraebodee

Then no one’s anybody.

A most alarming state of affairs. Equality — or democracy which is another word for it — is a political shibboleth believed in least by those who praise it most. It serves however as a subject for the hustings or for an address designed to prevent the digestion of an excellent dinner.

The oldest society or guild was the priesthood; it was composed of soothsayers — or truthtellers as they preferred to be called. In ancient Rome it is said soothsayers did not speak when they met; they merely smiled furtively at one another and passed on. They functioned for centuries and their services came to be sought even by rich and powerful kings; but with enlightenment the prophecy business like celestial insurance business declined. Its declension if slow has been sure and it is followed now only by those whose minds are attuned to the ideal rather than the practical. The guild which has held its power with the greatest skill and tenacity is that of the lawyer. The functions of other practitioners cease with their deaths but by the power of mortmain the lawyer is enabled to perpetuate his grasp upon another’s property and to continue the collection of fees and the distribution of costs until nothing is left. So dazzling are the operations of the law that one can scarcely bear to look upon them with the naked eye.

It has been claimed that the law like justice is blind. We all know that partially draped female figure holding with outstretched arm a balance or scales her eyes bandaged that she may not see those who appear before her; but the bandage frequently slips and occasionally the lady has been known to wink. I have found in the course of my studies that the law is a great respecter of persons — this is as it should be; but the chief glory of the law is the method by which it is dispensed. Especially in this country the administration of the law compels the admiration of the criminal classes of the world which flock to our shores where they may operate among us without molestation. Indeed the habitual exercise of compassion toward the rich and powerful criminal functions with such certainty that it seems hardly worth while to go through the process of trying him. Why should not the criminal be rewarded by a position of honor or emolument or both but that the members of the bar would be deprived of the right of exercising the godlike quality of mercy? And is not the law’s delay proverbial? The functioning of the law in our courts provides entertainment which sometimes serves to relieve the austerity of the proceedings. Not infrequently one hears an archaic Norman French spoken usually with an Irish accent by one who knows not what he is saying or why. Oyez! Oyez!

How favorably situated is the lawyer compared with the physician! A physician has a rich patient who is taken ill; the physician makes a grievous mistake in his diagnosis the patient dies and his colleague the undertaker comes into his own. With the lawyer it is not so. When he makes a mistake he asks for a ‘refresher’ as fees were formerly called demands a new trial and so proceeds ad infinitum. For the law is not an exact science like mathematics which is above all things monotonous. Take the apple problem worked out to a certainty by my distinguished ancestor Sir Isaac Newton or the lesser difficulty of the herring that has perplexed so many generations of scientists which has been stated thus: How many herring can one buy for elevenpence if a herring and a half cost three ha’pence? The problem was finally solved by Einstein working with real herring at our sisterly University at Princeton. In the higher mathematics the result is always the same; seven plus seven is always fourteen seven multiplied by seven is always fortynine. When lawyers multiply they multiply words and no one can foretell what the result may be.

‘The law’ as defined by Lord Coke ‘is the perfection of reason.’ It may be so but lawyers are especially fortunate in that they have it both ways. One makes a fortune by creating difficulties which his brother lawyer makes a fortune by solving. It has frequently been observed that lawyers seldom take their own medicine. One of the greatest of them Lord Mansfield once said that the operations of the law were so uncertain that if anyone claimed a property that belonged to him he would give it up rather than face a lawsuit.

Several years ago at a gathering of distinguished jurists in London a gathering at which I may say in all modesty that my opinion was occasionally sought I was asked what was the most important legal decision I ever made. For a moment I was at a loss — but only for a moment. I then told how I had reversed the decision of a lower court in a matter of great importance. A man had sued for damages sustained in falling into a coal hole which had been left open by the defendant. The lower court finding that the plaintiff had been intoxicated at the time of the accident decided that he had no case. The plaintiff was dissatisfied with this decision and came to my court for relief. After carefully reviewing the testimony my decision was: If the defendant was at fault in leaving an uncovered hole in the sidewalk of a public street the intoxication of the plaintiff cannot excuse such gross negligence; a drunken man is as much entitled to a safe street as a sober one and much more in need of it.

I remember that Sir Henry Dickens who died not long ago the son of the great novelist was so much struck by the clarity and wisdom of my decision that he asked me if I would not arrange to sit with him at the Old Bailey next morning he having a number of difficult cases to dispose of. Anxious to oblige him I agreed but I had no wig without which it would be better to appear in court in a state of nature. Finally the Lord Mayor who happened to be present graciously offered to lend me his and I may say in all frankness that it was thought to be very becoming and its possession if but momentary enabled me to concur in Sir Henry’s decisions which were generally considered to be among the most important handed down for many years in that famous Temple of Justice. I offer in evidence a copy of Pickwick with an inscription in the late jurist’s hand. (Evidence objected to as not germane; etc.)

It may profit us to inquire further into the nature of this science called the Law. It has been described by one who had in him the makings of a Lord Chancellor as the last result of human wisdom acting upon human experience for the benefit of the public. But it has also been said that the law is that which is forcefully asserted and plausibly maintained. It’s a nice point. Ribald jesters like William Shakespeare and Anthony Trollope have not seemed to understand the law in all its functioning. They refer to the delays incident to its application as though it were something that could be clapped upon a sore spot affording the sufferer instant relief. Such is not its nature — it has nothing in common with a plaster; rather it partakes of the nature of that succulent bivalve the oyster the shells of which are usually divided equally between those who seek its remedies the edible portion meantime disappearing between or among its practitioners. As the song goes:

A shell for thee and a shell for me;

The oyster is the lawyer’s fee

The Scotch proverb runs: ‘The law licks up a’.’

In former times and in happier countries than our own the will of the king was the law. In the Empire of the Mikado according to the late Sir William Gilbert when Majesty speaks when Majesty says kill the gentleman the gentleman is as good as dead and if he is dead why not say so? How eminently satisfactory and conclusive! How much suffering and suspense the beneficiary of the law if so I may call him is spared! The sentence and its execution are not two experiences separated by painful anxiety but a quick translation from a world of suspense and sorrow to Elysian Fields. Mob law is sometimes deprecated but not always. The learned Mr. Pickwick it will be remembered urged upon his friend Mr. Snodgrass the wisdom of shouting with the mob.

‘But suppose’ suggested the inquiring Mr. Snodgrass ‘ there are two mobs?’

‘Shout with the largest’ replied the judicial Mr. Pickwick. Thus translating into action the old legal axiom Vox populi vox dei.

But sir I should be less than frank as Woodrow Wilson used to say when he was about to becloud an issue with words — I should be less than frank if I did not refer to several of the law’s anomalies. Ignorance of it excuses no man we are told yet it fills a thousand volumes; this gives one furiously to think. Our jury system presents another difficulty. Some time since while I was endeavoring to unravel the intricacies of income-tax law — which changes every hour on the hour and which might more accurately be called an outgo law — I received a curt personal communication from the President of these so-called United States desiring me presently to put aside whatever I might be doing and for a ridiculously small fee as a juryman serve my country. As I have been somewhat critical of our jury system I did not seek to have myself excused as a wiser man would have done but at great inconvenience and for some days devoted myself unremittingly to unaccustomed duties.

For some reason I found myself to be extremely unpopular in the courtroom. Many were called but few were chosen and once only was I among the number; the intelligence of a bountifully built colored (Colored? Nay why should I not confess it? — black) woman was almost invariably preferred to mine. The jury after listening for hours to witnesses who under oath invariably contradicted one another were subsequently charged by the judge and were then sent elsewhere to discuss the evidence and to reach thereon an unanimous decision. ‘It must be unanimous’ the jury was told — and presently it was. But in Washington my Lud where the supreme judges of the nation assemble — gentlemen trained from youth to the law accustomed to sift evidence and to render decisions from which there is no appeal — these learned men are not required to be unanimous in their judgment but by a vote of five to four or more clearly speaking by a majority of one make the law of the land. We are now anxiously awaiting a decision from a court of nine men housed in a building covering an entire block or square in the City of Washington which building has been erected at a cost of thirteen millions of dollars — we await I say a decision as to whether or not words have meaning. My guess is that we shall presently be told very solemnly that they have not. I do not pretend to understand it. Why should a clot of mustard lodged in the digestive apparatus of one splenetic old gentleman affect the well-being of millions? I once sought an answer to this problem from a distinguished jurist my friend the late James M. Beck but his explanation although delivered with that magnificent aplomb for which he was famous only served to make darkness visible.

You cannot have failed to observe sir the extreme age to which lawyers live. Age does not wither them nor does custom stale. This for the reason that they have no cares or anxieties of their own; the cares and anxieties of their clients touch them only as the sun touches the flower: it causes them to blossom like a rose. Into this trade this opulent guild you are about to induct me and from the bottom of my heart I thank you and any little law business which you may entrust to me will meet with all the attention it deserves and for a fee which will surprise you — pleasantly. And sir speaking of fees or ‘refreshers’: are you aware that it was once thought insulting to cross a lawyer’s palm with gold? To save him this humiliation he placed in the hood of his gown a small pocket into which the client surreptitiously placed a rouleau of golden guineas. This is only one of the pleasant little fictions with which grave lawyers divert themselves. Another is that barristers are supposed to work for the love of their profession; they are not by law entitled to fees which cannot legally be collected.

You may laugh at the delicacy of former times but he laughs best who laughs last and lawyers’ fees have become no laughing matter.

The question has many times arisen as to whether there are lawyers in heaven. Pursuing this interesting inquiry I have discovered that there is one. How did he get there? He was refused admission by Saint Peter but a gust of wind carried his hat inside the gate: he was permitted to fetch it. Instantly he got inside he clapped a halo on his head instead of a hat and mingled with the crowd. A writ of habeas corpus — in plain English

‘ have his carcass ’ — was sought but the motion was overruled. Judges sometimes decline to overrule motions from mere force of habit. For example: Two men one a judge the other a plain lawyer were fishing in a rolling sea; the lawyer became very seasick and in his agony asked the judge to overrule the motion; his plea was denied and the lawyer died.

IV

But sir in addressing you I have no reason to suppose that others in my audience are as learned in the history of the law as you are. May I now address a word to them?

Before Blackstone began to deliver his lectures on the law in Oxford and to publish them the books available for students were few in number and poor in quality. The best of them was called by the summary title of Doctor and Student but its full title is A Dialogue between a Doctor of Divinity and a Student of the Laws of England. It was published in Latin first apparently in 1523 its author being Christopher St. Germain who was a member of the Inner Temple. It remained the leading textbook right down to the middle eighteenth century. What purports to be the eighteenth edition was published as recently as 1815. It was divided into many sections; the first four are (1) Of the Law Eternal; (2) Of the Law of Reason; (3) Of the Law of God; (4) Of the Law of Man. Section Thirteen explains what Synderesis is which I suspect very few of you know and which I shall be glad to explain upon receiving the usual retainer. There are other sections but these need not detain us.

It would seem (I speak with becoming hesitation as I have only recently become a Doctor of Laws) that until 1753 when Blackstone began his first course of lectures at Oxford there was no method of teaching law at all; the student first picked up what law he could: he took his good where he found it. The first edition of Blackstone’s Commentaries was published in 1765. It is a noble book in four volumes and to an extent that cannot be true of any other branch of learning Blackstone was the founder of modern legal education. If you will take the time to look into an early edition you may perhaps wonder at the complacent optimism with which he regarded the civil law — and even the savage criminal law — as the highest achievement of human wisdom but I think you will admire his style. It is full and fruity; and we can well believe the truth of the story that he wrote with a bottle of port at his elbow. He wrote his book in lodgings in the Temple and there is another story of his being frequently disturbed by the noisy guests of an author who lived on the same landing. One evening there was a knock on Blackstone’s door; upon opening it a little girl entered carrying a jordan — ‘Please sir Mother begs the loan of a pot of coals.’ The little girl thought she was addressing Oliver Goldsmith.

It is a great tribute to Blackstone that his work revised and revised many times again is still the foundation of the student’s textbook. But it is important to remember that there is something better than a knowledge of Blackstone and that is the reputation for having it. If one enjoys such a reputation for learning and always appears to take the law seriously one’s fortune is probably made. Lawyers have to deal with people in affairs which frequently concern their honor and invariably concern their pocket. These are much too sacred for them to permit anything in the way of wit or humor; the average client looks upon a jesting lawyer with as much abhorrence as a man would upon an archdeacon who was facetious at a funeral.

There is — there may be one exception to this rule. Perhaps when one becomes a judge a joke may be permitted but men do not usually become judges until they are old. May I parody the French saying: ‘If the young lawyer only dared; if the elderly judge only could.’ I am indebted for these details to a Judge of the King’s Bench of the High Court of Justice a man of such exalted rank that I hesitate to call him friend; he almost certainly would not like it and I might be accused of boasting of his acquaintance.

But sir this is my first brief. I however permit myself to inquire how could you know even with all your knowledge — how could you know when you advised me of the honor which the University of Pennsylvania proposed to do me that I had studied my law out of a copy of the first edition of Blackstone’s noble book? It is my intention to ask you sir to accept these volumes on behalf of the University of Pennsylvania and place them in its Library. I am aware that my action may be criticized that it may be likened to my kicking down the ladder by which I climbed to my present exalted position; but having completely mastered this science having torn the heart out of this mystery I feel that Blackstone has done for me all that lies within his power; I have no further use for him. Let future generations point to these volumes as those out of which Eddie Newton learnt his law. You sir doubtless know but I was surprised to learn that Blackstone the great legal scholar was not a particularly successful judge; or it may be that his fellow judges knowing less law than he and having the power to reverse him notwithstanding his learning took delight in so doing — for after all judges are but men and to err is human. But Blackstone’s Commentaries is a landmark of English literature as well as of the law. It will be found upon the list of one hundred of the most famous books in our language published some years ago by the Grolier Club of New York and our literature stretches its magnificent length from the time more than twelve hundred years ago when the angel visited Cædmon in the monastery at Whitby and endowed him with the power of putting into English verse the story of the fall and rise of man.

Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England anticipates by some fifty years the famous compilation of the laws of France usually referred to as the Code Napoléon which incidentally was the work of many men whereas Blackstone did his job singlehanded. One thinks of Dr. Johnson’s famous retort when Boswell reminded him that it took forty Frenchmen forty years to compile their dictionary whereas Johnson believed that he could do his work alone in three. ‘Sir’ he said ‘this then is the proportion. Forty times forty is sixteen hundred; as three is to sixteen hundred so is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman.’ Is it any wonder that the French find little merit in Johnson remarking that he had the manners of a beadle and the inclinations of a constable? Seventy editions of Blackstone have been printed in English fifty-six in French eleven in German nine in Italian. It has been printed at least once in most of the languages of Europe also in Chinese. In all it has been printed more than four hundred times and by actual count has caused eight million nine hundred and seventy-one members of the bar — that Mutual Admiration Society of which I have become a member — to fall into profound and refreshing slumber. Like causes produce like effects; I must be careful lest my words have the same soporific quality.

It has been a great pleasure to me to prepare this my first brief. The lines of Pope assisted by Horace may occur to you my Lud: —

And those who cannot write and those who can

All rhyme and scrawl and scribble to a man.

But I am not afraid of being laughed at for as Charles Lamb has said ‘one laugh is worth a hundred groans in any state of the market.’ I wish that I might write songs for he who writes the songs of a nation need not care who may make its laws. As I look around me slumber seems to have sealed the eyes of those whom I hoped might be my auditors. May I arouse them with the words of a song sung by England’s most enduring Lord Chancellor?

The law is the true embodyment

Of everything that’s excellent

It has no kind of fault or flaw

And I my Lud embody the law.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbm5lY3RjcmUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvYmxhY2tzdG9uZXMtZXEtb2ZmaWNlLWFwcG9pbnRzLWFsZXgtdm91dmFsaWRlcy1hcy1uZXctY2VvLWpvc2gtaGF0ZmllbGQtYXMtbmV3LWNvby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone’s EQ Office Appoints Alex Vouvalides as New CEO Josh Hatfield as New COO,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbm5lY3RjcmUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvYmxhY2tzdG9uZXMtZXEtb2ZmaWNlLWFwcG9pbnRzLWFsZXgtdm91dmFsaWRlcy1hcy1uZXctY2VvLWpvc2gtaGF0ZmllbGQtYXMtbmV3LWNvby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533D0D8640>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbm5lY3RjcmUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvYmxhY2tzdG9uZXMtZXEtb2ZmaWNlLWFwcG9pbnRzLWFsZXgtdm91dmFsaWRlcy1hcy1uZXctY2VvLWpvc2gtaGF0ZmllbGQtYXMtbmV3LWNvby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3R1cm50bzEwLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3dvb25zb2NrZXQtcmhvZGUtaXNsYW5kLWRlYWRseS1jYXItY3Jhc2gtaGFycmlzLWF2ZW51ZS1ibGFja3N0b25lLXN0cmVldC1tYXktMy10cmFmZmljLW9mZmVuc2VzLXBvbGljZS13b21hbi1jaGFyZ2Vk0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vdHVybnRvMTAuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3dvb25zb2NrZXQtcmhvZGUtaXNsYW5kLWRlYWRseS1jYXItY3Jhc2gtaGFycmlzLWF2ZW51ZS1ibGFja3N0b25lLXN0cmVldC1tYXktMy10cmFmZmljLW9mZmVuc2VzLXBvbGljZS13b21hbi1jaGFyZ2Vk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman faces felony charges in fatal Woonsocket crash,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3R1cm50bzEwLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3dvb25zb2NrZXQtcmhvZGUtaXNsYW5kLWRlYWRseS1jYXItY3Jhc2gtaGFycmlzLWF2ZW51ZS1ibGFja3N0b25lLXN0cmVldC1tYXktMy10cmFmZmljLW9mZmVuc2VzLXBvbGljZS13b21hbi1jaGFyZ2Vk0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vdHVybnRvMTAuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3dvb25zb2NrZXQtcmhvZGUtaXNsYW5kLWRlYWRseS1jYXItY3Jhc2gtaGFycmlzLWF2ZW51ZS1ibGFja3N0b25lLXN0cmVldC1tYXktMy10cmFmZmljLW9mZmVuc2VzLXBvbGljZS13b21hbi1jaGFyZ2Vk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533D0DA950>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3R1cm50bzEwLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3dvb25zb2NrZXQtcmhvZGUtaXNsYW5kLWRlYWRseS1jYXItY3Jhc2gtaGFycmlzLWF2ZW51ZS1ibGFja3N0b25lLXN0cmVldC1tYXktMy10cmFmZmljLW9mZmVuc2VzLXBvbGljZS13b21hbi1jaGFyZ2Vk0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vdHVybnRvMTAuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3dvb25zb2NrZXQtcmhvZGUtaXNsYW5kLWRlYWRseS1jYXItY3Jhc2gtaGFycmlzLWF2ZW51ZS1ibGFja3N0b25lLXN0cmVldC1tYXktMy10cmFmZmljLW9mZmVuc2VzLXBvbGljZS13b21hbi1jaGFyZ2Vk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9ibGFja3N0b25lLWZ1bmVyYWwtaG9tZS9oYXJyaWV0dC1zLXNhbnRhZ2F0YS15b3VuZ3N0b3duLW9oaW8v0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2tibi5jb20vbXktdmFsbGV5LXRyaWJ1dGVzL2JsYWNrc3RvbmUtZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lL2hhcnJpZXR0LXMtc2FudGFnYXRhLXlvdW5nc3Rvd24tb2hpby9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harriett S.

The trip marks the third time Boeing attempted to launch its craft into space — an estimated $600 million spent — and paves the way to sending crews onboard future flights.

“We have had an excellent flight test of a complex system that we expected to learn from along the way and we have” Mark Nappi vice president and program manager of Boeing Commercial Crew Program said in the release.

Boeing builds launch vehicle for mission to land first woman on the moon

Some of the functions the space capsule demonstrated were its autonomous software and on-orbit operations of various systems ability to receive commands from the space station cargo transfer and battery charging.

“With the completion of OFT-2 we will incorporate lessons learned and continue working to prepare for the crewed flight test and NASA certification” Nappi added.

The aerospace company signed a contract with NASA in 2014 to build spacecraft that astronauts could board to the ISS.

If Boeing completes a second flight it would mean NASA will have fulfilled its goal of having two commercial vehicles capable of transporting astronauts to the ISS from American soil.

“NASA’s Commercial Crew Program and our industry partner Boeing today took a major and successful step on the journey to enabling more human spaceflight missions to the International Space Station on American spacecraft from American soil” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement on Wednesday.

“The OFT-2 mission represents the power of collaboration which allows us to innovate for the benefit of humanity and inspire the world through discovery.”

But carmakers have experimented with all sorts of solutions in the past including gas turbine powerplants of the aircraft variety.

The Chrysler Turbine Car is perhaps the most iconic example. The project began in the mid-1950s with a turbine-powered Belvedere and morphed into a Chrysler of unique design by 1963. Mopar built 55 cars 50 of which were lent to the general public as part of a user program.The project was eventually canceled and all but nine cars were destroyed. But Chrysler wasn't the only American carmaker that ventured into gas turbine territory.General Motors also toyed with the idea through the Firebird a series of four prototypes/concepts it introduced between 1953 and 1959. But what about Ford the company that introduced the first mass-produced automobile in the early 1900s?Well FoMoCo's efforts in this department aren't as iconic as the Chrysler Turbine Car or the GM Firebird  but it also meddled with gas turbine engines.Its most known project is Big Red a turbine-powered experimental truck showcased in 1964. But it turns out that Ford actually put together its first turbine car almost a decade before that.It was essentially a Ford Thunderbird with an engine swap and used a Boeing 8C to move about. Developed between August 1955 and March 1956 shortly after the iconic Thunderbird made its debut the project remained a secret until 2022 when it was unveiled to the world by Ford archivist Ted Ryan.According to a report sheet that was published alongside an old photo of the car Ford's objective was to ""obtain experience with gas turbine engine packaging and operation"" as well as to obtain a ""usable and reliable"" turbine vehicle for ""appraising the special advantages and problems"" associated with this type of powerplant.The prototype itself wasn't radically different than a regular-production Thunderbird.While GM and Chrysler created unique vehicles for their gas turbine experiments  Ford simply stuffed a Boeing engine in the T-Bird's bay. The sheet mentions that the ""conventional front-engine installation"" was made using ""production components"" so there wasn't any wild engineering.Ford opted for a front exhaust system so the Thunderbird had massive pipes running through the lower front fenders. The picture also shows an additional sizable vent on the rear fender hinting at some sort of cooling system mounted in the trunk.The Boeing 8C turbine was rated at 175 horsepower which wasn't particularly powerful at the time. It actually produced less oomph than the Thunderbird 's 292-cubic-inch (4.8-liter) V8 mill which delivered up to 198 horsepower in 1955.Sadly there's no additional info about the turbine-powered T-Bird in terms of engineering but the sheet does include the company's conclusions after the experiment.Ford discovered numerous advantages including a good power-to-weight ratio good medium-speed acceleration and a lack of vibration. The turbine engine also needed ""relatively little routing maintenance"" compared to a piston powerplant.On the other hand testing also revealed ""serious acceleration lag in start-up"" and an ""undesirability"" of having a front-mounted exhaust. Needless to say the latter must have been a serious issue due to the noise and heat that must have entered the cabin even when the hardtop was in place.The project proved quite expensive. Ford spent $180000 on engineering labor and materials and an extra $8000 on maintenance. That's the equivalent of almost $2 million today which is a massive figure for a prototype built on an existing platform.Needless to say the turbine-powered Thunderbird did not go into production. The fate of the prototype is unknown but given that Detroit automakers had a habit to scrap experimental vehicles this T-Bird was probably destroyed. But it's cool to know that Ford once built a Boeing-powered sports car that actually ran.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDUvMjkvcGVudGFnb24tcmVwbGFjZS1kb29tc2RheS1wbGFuZS0wMDAzNDY4NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Time is ticking to replace the Pentagon's 1970s-era Doomsday planes,"This wide-body jumbo jet tail number 75-1025 is one of four Boeing 747-200s that are custom-made to keep the government operating in the event of an infrastructure-shattering nuclear war. Commonly referred to as the “Doomsday planes” these E-4B Nightwatch aircraft typically fly the defense secretary or the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff around the world.

And as Russian President Vladimir Putin threatens nuclear war over Western allies’ response to his invasion of Ukraine these flying fallout shelters are more relevant than they’ve been in a generation.

Yet the planes are showing their age. And the replacement still at least half a decade away has for years lost out to internal budget battles that tend to favor shiny new fighter jets and bombers.

Even if the replacement program gets all the money the Air Force is requesting this year the new planes won’t be delivered until 2027 meaning the existing aircraft will need to fly well past their 50th birthday.

It’s a situation that has experts and defense industry advocacy groups on edge.

“[The Air Force and Congress] need to get very real about this recapitalization” said Douglas Birkey executive director at Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies “or they will see some very severe risks adopted that shouldn’t be.”

A retro chic bunker

The Boeing 747 used to be known as the “queen of the skies.” But major commercial airlines that flew the 200 series retired them in the late 1990s and early 2000s which means the Air Force has flown these planes for 20 years past their expected lifespan Birkey said.

To celebrate the mission’s 60th anniversary and give an inside peek at what it’s like to work at the National Airborne Operations Center the Air Force invited a group of reporters for a two-hour flight over Nebraska Iowa and South Dakota last month.

Before reporters were led on board military personnel removed a suite of highly classified communications systems. Guests were then escorted into “Gordo 14” the callsign for this plane for the day. Unlike other Air Force aircraft the E-4Bs’ nicknames change for each flight.

The plane is full of reminders that it’s 43 years old. There’s a spiral staircase — with a chandelier at the top — that takes you to the cockpit. The cockpit itself is full of analog controls. Throughout the plane there’s almost nothing digital aside from the clocks inside the conference room and near military workstations. Each workstation is outfitted with a hardwired phone and outdated monitors that are reminiscent of 1980s-era Apple computers.

The Air Force is mum on how the plane is actually able to withstand a nuclear attack. That information is classified. But it is known that the computers and wiring onboard are hardened with thermal and nuclear shielding.

It was a beautiful late spring day over the Midwest as Gordo 14 took off but there wasn’t much of a view. There are no windows and no natural light anywhere in the plane aside from the cockpit. It’s all to protect the communications system from outside heat or an electromagnetic pulse said Col. Brian Golden National Airborne Operations Center and 595th Command and Control Group chief.

The four-engine modified 747-200 is designed for missions that last up to 72 hours which costs the U.S. taxpayer $147000 an hour. It’s the highest flight hour cost of any military plane aside from Air Force One Golden said.

The main cabin includes a soundproof video conference room the defense secretary can use on overseas trips. There is also an area for passengers and a separate room where the secretary can sleep. The E-4B is the same size as Air Force One but the different aircraft types use the space differently. The Doomsday plane is stuffed with communications equipment while Air Force One has more space for passengers.

Military experts and advocates of a swift E-4B replacement argue that the current plane belongs in a museum. In fact E-4B pilot Lt. Col. Pete Amaral noted that at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum you can see the nose section of a 747-100 a model that’s only slightly older than this E-4B. It looks “eerily familiar” he said.

“It was fun when I was there with my kids and I was like hey look this is literally the inside of the airplane that I fly” Amaral said.

Finding a replacement

The Air Force says it wants to take these planes out of the sky within the next 10 years but it still hasn’t announced what it would replace them with. Golden said to expect a solicitation in the fall and the fiscal 2023 budget request sets aside $203 million to award contracts next year.

The project is classified but public documents show the Air Force has released 16 market surveys to industry since December 2020 that suggest the requirements for the program may still be in flux caught up in a back-and-forth with defense contractors.

Under the replacement program the Air Force will buy commercial derivative planes modify them to survive a nuclear blast and add communications systems.

The 747-200 has four engines. If the Air Force decides that the replacement needs four as well to power the communications systems and also allow the aircraft to fly if one engine is damaged then only one U.S.-made commercial aircraft currently flying meets that need — the Boeing 747-800.

But that plane is becoming a relic too; in January 2021 Boeing received its final order for the 747-800.

“When this whole thing began the 747 line was alive” said Richard Aboulafia managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. “Well there is a problem now because in fact it is dying. It’s probably too late to place an order.”

The Air Force will pay dearly for waiting. It didn’t make a large investment while the 747-800 production line was up and running so it will likely have to buy used aircraft which adds another layer of complexity and risk to the program.

From fiscal year 2020 through 2022 the Air Force spent $157 million to develop program requirements conduct market research hire personnel to work on the effort and prototype new communications systems. For fiscal year 2023 the service is requesting its first significant investment of $203 million and from fiscal year 2024 through 2027 it projects spending of over $3 billion.

There is widespread agreement that it’s time to replace the E-4B fleet but the project needs powerful supporters on Capitol Hill because the cost will appear “incredibly expensive” due to the communications gear required for the aircraft Birkey said.

“It is going to take strong advocacy to push it across the line” Birkey said.

The Air Force does have a champion in Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) whose home state includes Offutt Air Force Base the home of the E-4B fleet.

Fischer during a Senate Armed Services hearing in April poked at the fact the Air Force has underfunded the program in previous budget cycles and urged the service to move faster. “I was very glad to see the Air Force’s budget commit significant resources to developing a replacement” after studying the project for over a decade she said.

Air Force Global Strike Command chief Gen. Anthony Cotton did not acknowledge the delay but noted that the requirements for the E-4B replacement were just approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council meaning the service can begin buying the new aircraft.

“I think the final product of what we’re going to see is as far as fleet size is going to be very [affordable] for the president for the secretary as well as the chairman moving forward” Cotton said.

Another member of the Nebraska delegation GOP Rep. Don Bacon is also a supporter of the E-4B replacement program and noted that global tensions are making the situation more urgent.

The E-4B “has served us well for decades but it’s time to replace it. Russia’s reckless attack on Ukraine is a reminder that there’s no time to lose” Bacon told POLITICO in a statement.

The Air Force notified the House Armed Services Committee that the service will brief lawmakers on the replacement program by the end of the month.

Keeping the E-4B flying

Meanwhile the crews flying the Doomsday planes need to keep them flying and it’s getting expensive. The Air Force is requesting $195 million in fiscal year 2023 solely for depot maintenance.

Experts expect maintenance costs will grow over the next five years. And because Boeing isn’t making the planes anymore spare parts are hard to find.

But the Air Force is still investing in upgrades and training systems for the E-4B. On April 1 the Air Force received a $16 million full-motion simulator a first for the E-4B. It means airmen can train in Nebraska rather than having to travel to Miami.

The Air Force also wants to improve the E-4B’s communications systems setting aside $25 million in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. One of the projects is the Survivable Super High Frequency built by L3Harris that will replace portions of the E-4B’s aging jam-resistant secure communications system.

Meanwhile the E-4B’s maintenance team is constantly working with 12 people on alert around the clock every day of the year. And they’re doing it all without a hangar: In June 2017 a tornado hit Offutt Air Force Base where two E-4Bs were stored causing $8.5 million in damage.

Two years later flooding in March 2019 destroyed the 595th Command and Control Group’s offices and alert center. Last year Offutt began rebuilding its runway and E-4B operations moved temporarily to Lincoln airport.

Against the backdrop the Air Force continued to delay its search for a replacement while watching the E-4B fleet slowly decay.

Things became so dire to reduce wear and tear that the E-4B is no longer trotted out for travel within the U.S. but only overseas so that the aging aircraft can get much-needed maintenance and upgrades Golden said.

Although the Air Force plans to launch a formal search this year there is a real possibility the project may face delays which will put more pressure on the E-4B maintenance team and the piecemeal approach they use to keep the fleet flying.

“With the flood the pandemic — that was inconvenient but we’ll still complete the mission” DeBonis said."

Drivers participating in the 106th Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge gathered Saturday morning for the first “500” public drivers’ meeting since 2019.

Taking place on pit road with the Borg-Warner Trophy 2023 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 70th Anniversary Pace Car and a large gathering of fans in the Tower Terrace grandstands accompanying the field of 33 drivers competitors received final instructions for Sunday’s race and Indianapolis 500 starters’ rings by Jostens.

The 106th Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge is scheduled to start at 12:45 p.m. (ET) Sunday. The race will be broadcast live on NBC Telemundo Deportes on Universo and the INDYCAR Radio Network with pre-race shows beginning at 11 a.m.

Indianapolis Motor Speedway President J. Douglas Boles opened the meeting by thanking fans for returning after the pandemic prevented them from attending the drivers’ meeting the last two years and with Sunday’s crowd expected to be one of the biggest in the history of the event.

Helio Castroneves who claimed his fourth Indianapolis 500 victory last year joining A.J.Foyt Al Unser and Rick Mears in the four-time winners club was introduced and saidhe’ll do everything he can to create a new club with a fifth win this year.

“It would be awesome” Castroneves said about a potential history-making fifth Indy 500 victory. “Something that no one on the planet was able to do.”

Nizar Trigui chief technology officer and group president of solutions businesses for Bridgestone Americas later took to the stage reconfirming Firestone’s commitment to sustainability in INDYCAR and referenced Firestone will be celebrating its 73rd driver winning on Firestone tires this year.

NTT INDYCAR SERIES Race Director Kyle Novak followed with final Race Day instructions for the drivers and left them with some advice.

“Race hard” he said. “Race the way you want to be raced. Take a moment to look around you. You’re surrounded by the best drivers in the world.”

To conclude the meeting Curt Bruns vice president of the motorsports division at Jostens presented this year’s record-setting polesitter Scott Dixon with a special Jostens ring.

She was checking what was trending on Google when her phone blew up with story after story that the house that inspired ""The Conjuring"" movie was for sale.

Her first thoughts:

""Oh my God I need to find out where this is what this is"" she recounted Thursday. ""When I realized it was only an hour from me — I need to see this; I need to own this.""

The house at 1677 Round Top Rd. Burrillville was owned then by Cory and Jenn Heinzen who ran tours during the day and rented it out overnight to people who styled themselves as paranormal investigators.

Without divulging her interest Nuñez booked the first available tour two days later on a Monday afternoon.

Nuñez's first visit to the 'Conjuring' house

That Monday. Nuñez a real estate developer was working on a job site in East Boston. ""I cut out early"" she said.

""I remember walking the grounds just in awe of it"" she said. At 8.5 acres of mostly open land with ancient stonewalls a footbridge crossing a creek and woods it was just what she had been looking for — any paranormal presence was just a bonus.

She still kept quiet about he motives while on the tour. ""I just went up to Cory introduced myself told him how much I loved the house.""

But she knew she had to own it.

""This kind of checked all the boxes for me"" she said. ""Five o'clock I got home and I wrote up an offer.""

It took some negotiating. The Heinzens had asked $1.2 million and Nuñez had to come up ""substantially"" on her initial offer; they closed Thursday at $1.525 million.

Is Nuñez afraid of living in 'The 'Conjuring' house?

Nuñez won't quite be living in the house she said while showing visitors around Thursday shortly after all the papers were signed and it became hers.

""That was one of the conditions of the sale: whoever bought this could not live here year-round"" she said.

She will keep her house in Boston but spend a lot of daytime hours in the Burrillville house sleeping there about one week a month.

But she doesn't plan on being ""alone"" there.

""I fully expect some paranormal phenomena to happen to me"" she said. ""I expect to be startled. I expect to be scared that I'm experiencing something but I don't expect a malevolent experience.""

It wouldn't be her first paranormal experience. That happened about six years ago while converting a building she owned in Boston into condos. ""I had a physical experience with an entity in a house once: They physically touched my arms and my hands.""

""I'm more afraid of the living than I am of the dead"" she said with a nod toward frequent trespassers who have beset previous owners of the house. (Cory Heinzen said that was one of his motivations for selling.)

""I know it's going to be an issue at certain times of the year"" she said.

Who is Jacqueline Nuñez?

Nuñez 58 is owner of Boston-based WonderGroup a real-estate development firm.

She was born in Kansas and ""grew up"" in Indiana and Oklahoma.

She was a college volleyball player and has a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University.

She came to the University of Rhode Island as an assistant women's volleyball coach and earned a master's degree from URI.

A desire to pursue a law career brought her Boston where she got a law degree from Northeastern University.

A desire not to be a lawyer pushed her into development.

She said she has been interested in the paranormal for as long as she can remember probably an outgrowth from a love of horror films.

A horror-film fan with an interest in the paranormal probably can't own a better house than the one that inspired one of the biggest horror films of all time.

""What I love about this house: It does enable people to connect with people who have moved on"" she said. ""It's so beautiful and so peaceful.""

Nuñez has plans for the 'Conjuring' house

At first not much will change from how the Heinzens have run the house. All bookings for overnight stays in 2022 will be honored Nuñez said. She plans to restart daytime tours.

For next year after she has had time to learn the business and ""learn the house"" she hopes to add offerings for the paranormal community though she's not prepared to go into much detail yet. ""I want to do things that will attract the community.""

One experience she's considering: ""mini-investigations"" where people with no experience with the paranormal could book a few hours rather than a whole night and be assisted by an experienced paranormal investigator.

Despite her being a real estate developer Nuñez said there are no condos or other development planned. Her purchase of the property was for personal reasons and to keep the house open to the paranormal community.

""That is my intent for now. I certainly have to pay the bills for it all. For the foreseeable future I'll be growing it as a business"" she said. ""This is me. That's what this is about.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYmFua2VyYW5kdHJhZGVzbWFuLmNvbS9zaWxlbnQtdGhyZWF0LXRvLXByb3BlcnR5LXJpZ2h0cy1jcmVlcHMtZm9yd2FyZC1vbi1iZWFjb24taGlsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Silent Threat to Property Rights Creeps Forward on Beacon Hill,"Despite the end of another cold winter in Massachusetts many small property owners still feel the chill of hostile housing proposals – which would violate their property rights – circulating on Beacon Hill. Among the proposals heard by the Massachusetts state legislature there is one proposal in particular that remains more ominous due to its silent progression since last year without sufficient alarm raised by lawmakers and the public.

In fact a version of this silent killer actually passed the House and Senate in 2021 and would have become law had Gov. Charlie Baker not vetoed it at the end of the legislative session thereby averting an override of his veto. What the governor recognized which evaded some other officials was that the proposal would have imposed a government mandate dictating when how and to whom property owners could sell their buildings.

Often called a “tenant right of first refusal” or an alternative abbreviation “TOPA” this proposal amounts to the government pre-ordaining a small set of buyers who extend beyond tenants themselves in some cases while artificially blocking others from purchasing rental properties on the open market.

As numbered currently S.890 and H.1426 would impose a tenant right of first refusal in the sale of rental properties throughout Massachusetts. H.4208 meanwhile is a home rule petition that would apply the same restrictions in the city of Somerville exclusively.

If passed these bills could prevent property owners from selling their properties at market value and make it much more difficult for buyers to purchase and invest in rental property. The law restricts the seller’s ability to select the strongest offer and instead forces the seller to accept contingencies and abide by terms and conditions spelled out in the legislation rather than the marketplace.

If this policy is imported to Massachusetts property owners could witness their life-long work to build equity stolen from them.

This legislation would also create significant delays and uncertainty for buyers especially when trying to secure financing as the buyer must wait in place for the right of first refusal process prescribed in the bills to play out.

D.C. a Cautionary Tale

Per economist and economic development consultant Joe Cortright writing in City Observatory in 2020 Washington D.C.’s TOPA law has allowed a small subset of lawyers and speculators to use tenants as pawns in delaying the sale of rental properties in order to extort money from property owners. Meanwhile less than 5 percent of tenants ended up buying the properties that they rented under this policy according to a study reported by the Washington Post.

In Washington D.C. a “for sale” sign on an apartment building serves as a blinking neon ad to attorneys who have promised tenants large sums of money if they obstruct the owner’s rightful attempt to sell the property on the owner’s terms. The attorneys then extort money from the property owner by pushing the owner to pay off each tenant to forgo his or her TOPA rights – typically $15000 to $20000 depending on factors like the size of a unit. However according to a 2017 report by NBC News Washington payouts were said to be as high as $50000 to $100000.

After delaying the sale of a property the attorneys take the greater share of the property owner’s payoff yielding little to no advantage to the tenant who is diverted from finding alternative and affordable housing options. Then the attorneys start this process of extortion all over again by hijacking the owner’s effort to sell each time the owner finds a new prospective buyer. Since time is of the essence during a closing process executing a sale on terms that are favorable to an owner becomes essentially impossible under TOPA. The law has made selling multifamily properties much more difficult and expensive.

It Could Happen Here

Tenants were also found to be selling their TOPA rights to speculators for large sums of money – to the detriment of other potential buyers – while delaying the closing process. NBC News Washington’s 2017 report also showed that TOPA can contribute to higher rents. It could even contribute to a greater shortage of affordable housing if new construction of multifamily homes were halted due to the onerous provisions within the District’s boundaries.

If this policy is imported to Massachusetts the property owners who wish to sell their properties as part of their retirement plans would be barred from doing so as they witness their life-long work to build equity stolen from them. Moreover property tax revenues would shrink likely triggering tax increases on the general public to compensate for those lost revenues.

Given that TOPA bills almost became law in Massachusetts if it were not for a last-minute save by Gov. Baker it is clear that this threat remains real and imminent especially given the hijinks and shenanigans that traditionally take place before the end of the legislative session which will conclude this year on July 31.

Thus the Small Property Owners Association urges all who care about fair housing policies to contact their representatives with heightened urgency to oppose these bills. If tenant activists believe that “housing is about people” they must respect the rights of the very people who provide more than 60 percent of the rental housing in Massachusetts.

The contract with the city required proper handling and disposal of asbestos which is known to cause lung disease and cancer. The worksite was on a narrow street bordered by homes.

EVERETT — Three weeks before nearly 500 students from the Everett High School class of 2018 would toss their caps in the air at Veterans Memorial Stadium contractors excavated the street behind the stadium and left crumbling asbestos pipes in an open dumpster about 50 yards from the field house entrance.

But Gregory T. Antonelli ordered him to get the job done Capwell told the Globe.

“He was like ‘I don’t care. Just get the pipe in the ground’” said Capwell who said he reported the job to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.

Contractors left asbestos pipe exposed in a dumpster along Marlboro Street behind Veterans Memorial Stadium in May 2018. Pedestrians were walking on the adjacent sidewalk the state attorney general alleged in a complaint filed in Suffolk Superior Court.

Attorney General Maura Healey and the DEP are suing Antonelli in Suffolk Superior Court alleging he and his company GTA Co. Inc. risked the health and safety of residents workers and members of the public. He has denied the allegations in court and told the Globe he did not recall a worker raising objections.

Despite that ongoing legal imbroglio GTA has flourished in Everett over the past four years collecting nearly $8 million on city contracts for paving landscaping and more water main replacements.

Longtime residents say that’s just the way things work in Everett where certain influential people and their families are viewed as untouchable. Just across the Mystic River from Boston Everett has been transformed in recent years by a high-end casino and an influx of immigrants. But a Globe review found this diverse gateway city of 49000 still runs on old friendships and bad blood a thicket of political alliances controlled by a circle of white political leaders who owe their jobs their contracts or their allegiance to the mayor Carlo DeMaria.

In his tempestuous 15 years in office the mayor his opponents say has consolidated power over every corner of the city from the public schools to the town library by installing loyalists in key positions and repeatedly persuading the City Council to amend the city charter to afford him greater influence.

Cowed allies across city government have helped him weather a series of controversies that might have spelled political doom in another community. DeMaria won reelection unopposed in 2017 three years after four women accused him of sexual harassment. He was reelected in November eight weeks after the city clerk accused him of extorting $97000 from him in a real estate deal. His unsuccessful challenger for mayor former councilor Fred Capone alleged DeMaria defrauded taxpayers of $180000 by secretly collecting inflated “longevity bonuses” that made him the highest paid mayor in the state. The school superintendent accused DeMaria of race and gender discrimination. Both she and the city clerk have spoken with the FBI after finding surveillance cameras in their offices. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment. It is not yet known when the cameras were installed and at whose request.

The allegations have outraged some Everett residents who have used frequent public records requests and their familiarity with the city’s entrenched culture to further expose conflicts and demand accountability. Some are considering forming a political action committee to recall the mayor.

DeMaria 49 has denied all allegations and is suing the clerk and the Everett Leader Herald for defamation. He defends his $40000-a-year bonuses — 16 times the rate Capone says was intended on top of his base salary of $185000 — noting that councilors approved the annual budgets that included them.

“I did not steal money from the city” DeMaria said. “I was entitled to it.”

In a lengthy interview he dismissed his critics as politically motivated insisted he has the support of average residents and pointed with pride to the dazzling changes he has presided over in Everett.

“This is my city” he said. “In the words of David Ortiz this is our [expletive] city.”

“This is the place my parents came from Italy and settled” he also said. “I could have left a long time ago. I got a sense of commitment to the place. I really do.”

And to those who protest that Everett is too much DeMaria’s — that he has seized undue control and he rules with an iron fist — he says that he installs the right people and works hard that he is accessible to the voters in the grocery store or on the street.

“It’s not DeMariaVille” he said. “It’s Everett.”

To understand how government works in Everett it’s important to appreciate how common it is for city leaders’ lives and livelihoods to be intertwined in ways that are ripe for conflict.

Many city officials are related. Anthony DiPierro the city councilor who resigned last week after weeks of public criticism for the racist language he acknowledged using in private messages is a son of the mayor’s cousin.

Others hold multiple roles in city affairs. Sergio Cornelio the clerk is also the city’s historian public records access officer and election committee chairman. He moonlights as a snowplow operator for Antonelli whom he called one of his oldest friends in an interview with the Globe. The mayor explained his decision to embark on a private real estate deal with the city clerk this way: “We were very close. He was like a little brother to me for a long time.”

At times as they pursued their real estate deal the mayor and clerk also engaged Antonelli a top city developer who routinely seeks permits and development approvals from city employees and boards.

Mayor Carlo DeMaria maintains he was always a partner with City Clerk Sergio Cornelio in a real estate deal that has embroiled the city in controversy.

Their target was an unusual property for Everett — a 14100-square-foot lot with a house built in 1822 and a red barn. Just steps from Everett Square it’s nearly adjacent to a parking lot the city’s urban renewal plan pegged for redevelopment; only a concrete wall and a small city-owned lot separate the parcels.

Property records show that Cornelio bought the property alone for $900000 in August 2019 and resold it for $1.3 million in 2021. The dispute centers on Cornelio’s grudging payment of $97000 of the proceeds to DeMaria who he asserts did nothing to earn the money.

After Cornelio’s claims were reported in the local newspaper last fall the mayor sued him for defamation and defended the payment as legitimately owed saying the two men had always been partners in the deal. The mayor filed documents in Middlesex Superior Court showing that both he and Cornelio had signed a purchase offer and that DeMaria’s name had been struck from a purchase and sale agreement drafted in June 2019. An e-mail filed in court said the recommendation to drop his name came from the lender who said it would be easier to finance the project with only one name on the contract.

Under the state’s conflict of interest law DeMaria — who recently got his real estate license — can buy property in the city privately so long as he doesn’t take official action on it in his capacity as mayor.

A legal opinion DeMaria sought in August 2020 encouraged him to publicly disclose his investment to prevent the perception of conflict of interest — and to avoid any involvement in the urban renewal plan.

To be transparent DeMaria and his lawyer say he filed a “Disclosure of Appearance of Conflict of Interest” in the city clerk’s office.

But that disclosure came in September 2020 after Cornelio had bought the property filed a similar disclosure and created an LLC alone. By that time Antonelli had submitted plans to redevelop the historic property into a 50-unit apartment building using the adjacent city-owned parcel for parking.

The apartment plan was withdrawn however and replaced with a more modest proposal to convert the two-family house into six units on the 14100-square-foot lot. Then a curious thing happened: The square footage on the plans grew to 15553 including almost the precise dimensions of the adjacent city-owned lot.

David O’Neil the attorney who presented the plans to the Zoning Board of Appeals said the city lot was not included in the calculation. He attributed the discrepancy to a more recent land survey.

“Sometimes in different projects property lines are inaccurately identified they get surveyed they get corrected” added Michael Sams a lawyer for Antonelli.

Massachusetts’ conflict of interest law designed to prevent self-dealing among public employees and their relatives also bars city employees from being paid for two roles. But it allows for exceptions — for instance permitting city workers to be designated “special municipal employees” so they can simultaneously serve as elected officials.

In Everett where city officials often bounce back and forth between appointed panels and elected boards those exceptions are becoming the norm. Last fall two city employees got elected to the School Committee and designated special municipal employees. That has led skeptics to question the allegiances of a panel that is ostensibly independent of City Hall.

City Veterans Commissioner Jeanne Cristiano now chairs the School Committee. Michael Mangan a legislative aide to the City Council chairs the panel’s finance subcommittee. (A former city councilor he was fined $8000 for campaign finance violations when he ran for state representative in 2013.)

A third newly elected School Committee member is Michael McLaughlin a former city councilor who works for Antonelli’s company lives in one of the properties he developed and tapped Antonelli as a treasurer for a past campaign.

In a complaint filed with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination in January Superintendent Priya Tahiliani claimed the mayor got himself and his allies elected to the School Committee to muster the votes to oust her because she is a woman of color.

Tahiliani an Indian American became the first person of color hired to lead the majority-minority Everett schools in March 2020. Her efforts to diversify the all-white school leadership team irked the mayor who called her racist and McLaughlin who scrutinized her nonwhite hires she alleged in her complaint.

The council also changed the city charter at the mayor’s request to make him a voting member of the School Committee in January 2021.

DeMaria declined to address Tahiliani’s complaint in detail. But he noted that he had sought a voting role on the School Committee long before she arrived.

McLaughlin rejected the assertion that he ran for School Committee to help DeMaria gain more control over the schools.

“Nobody controls what Mike McLaughlin does” he said. “Nobody tells me what to do and how to do it. If I felt content enough I could have stayed on City Council.

It was not the first time that DeMaria seized control of a city board.

In 2019 three years after appointing his wife and sister-in-law to the Library Board of Trustees he also overhauled that panel which had overseen the local libraries for 139 years. He made it clear he wanted control over staffing decisions which were handled by a professional library director supervised by the volunteer board.

“I am not going to put a majority of women — who are all nice ladies and mothers and so forth like my wife and my sister-in-law and others— they should not be handling HR issues” DeMaria said at a public hearing.

The move drew opposition from residents librarians and even an “intellectual freedom and social responsibility committee” of the Massachusetts Library Association. But the council changed the administrative code to give the mayor control of the libraries. The dozen trustees he appoints are now paid stipends for a total annual cost of $26200.

The library director resigned in protest and was not replaced for over two and a half years. All that time Matthew Lattanzi the son of the mayor’s personal scheduler filled in.

Matthew Lattanzi 29 started working part time for the city not long after he passed the bar exam in 2018.

Today he’s both the city’s planning and development director and assistant city solicitor though the job descriptions called for five years of distinct professional experience in each of those fields. (The library position also called for five years’ experience and a master’s in library science but he held it only on an interim basis.) His salary rose from under $70000 in 2019 to over $90000 last year.

Asked to explain his knack for landing city jobs Lattanzi pointed to his eagerness to learn and his passion for planning and zoning.

“I worked in the city solicitor’s office as a high school college kid” he said. “I have a passion to learn things and I’m really not scared of trying a new challenge.”

But skeptics see favoritism at work. He’s the son of Dolores Lattanzi the mayor’s personal scheduler and Alfred Lattanzi a city councilor who owns Everett Supply & True Value Hardware.

The last independently owned hardware store in Everett the store was one of three vendors fingered in a 2007 audit commissioned by a previous mayor as inappropriately favored by the city. (Another was Antonelli’s GTA.) Everett’s procurement officer said the city had been doing “excessive and expensive” business with Everett Supply and the audit questioned the “soundness of the business practice” of relying on the local hardware store for supplies rather than seeking competitive bids.

Everett Supply & True Value a major city supplier of hardware supplies and truck rentals is owned by City Councilor Alfred Lattanzi. He is also proposing to develop 16 apartments above the store a plan from which his son the city's planning director has to recuse himself. Erin Clark/Globe Staff

Last year the city spent $147558 at Everett Supply according to purchasing records obtained through public records requests. To deliver food to homebound seniors during the pandemic the city began regularly renting vans from Everett Supply at day rates higher than Home Depot’s. Everett Supply also charged the city $595 for each massive truck rented to haul food from the Greater Boston Food Bank to local pantries sometimes six at a time.

Everett Supply also received $6589 of the city’s portion of federal CARES Act funding in May 2021. When asked to substantiate that payment the city provided an Everett Supply invoice for 22 cases of nitrile gloves that was dated April 2020. The finance office blamed the mistake on a typo.

State law allows the city to tap Everett Supply as a qualified statewide vendor for most hardware supplies under $10000 based on its commitment to provide certain products at a discount.

A city spokeswoman defended the spending saying that since 2018 the city has spent more than twice as much at Home Depot.

Alfred Lattanzi did not respond to requests for comment. The disclosure he filed as a new city councilor noted his wife’s work for the mayor as well as his submission of plans to redevelop his hardware store into a 16-unit apartment building.

The Antonelli family holds similar influence over a variety of departments in Everett from licensing to elections. Greg Antonelli became a flashpoint of criticism after residents discovered he has continued to profit from city contracts and development while racking up unpaid tax and water bills worth nearly $180000. (He has since paid the bills.)

The residents also suspected — and the Globe confirmed — that Antonelli and his brother both voted in Everett in November although neither lives in the city. Greg Antonelli voted from the property that his sister Lisa owns alone according to city elections records and property records. He and his wife Caryn a part-time Everett employee live in Lynnfield according to property records campaign donations to DeMaria and even the deposition he gave in DeMaria’s court case in March.

A voter can own multiple properties but have only one legal residence based on where they spend most of their time and make their home according to the state elections division.

The Lynnfield Town Clerk’s office confirmed that Antonelli is not registered to vote from the home where he is listed as a resident but that Caryn Antonelli is. “I don’t vote in Lynnfield” Greg Antonelli told the Globe. “I don’t vote in two places.”

Greg Antonelli’s brother Christopher voted in Everett in November even though he told the Globe he has lived in Asia for 18 years.

“I pay taxes in the states. I have a US Social Security number. I think I have a certain level of entitlement to vote in a variety of elections” Christopher Antonelli said by phone.

While it’s true that US citizens who live overseas can vote absentee or via e-mail in all local state and federal elections the vote should be cast at the last address a person lived according to a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts secretary of state’s office. Christopher Antonelli worked for Lehman Brothers in New York for about a decade after his upbringing in Everett and he still owns property in Hoboken N.J. according to property records and media reports.

In addition Everett election records show an absentee ballot requested in his name in October was signed under penalty of perjury with a signature that looks different than his other signatures on file.

Christopher Antonelli declined to address the circumstances of his vote.

“I confirmed that is my vote record so you can imply what you would like from the signature” he said by e-mail.

When asked about the Antonellis’ votes DeMaria named someone he said voted for his opponent even though he’d moved out of Everett.

“I know that people have left the city continue to vote in the city stay on the voting rolls” DeMaria said. “That’s not right. But I don’t get involved.”

After the Globe’s inquiry Caryn Antonelli got a promotion: She’s now election coordinator and assistant registrar.

Another Antonelli sibling licensing board member Philip Antonelli works for GTA and was also involved in the unannounced asbestos job in 2018 according to a state inspector’s report. He declined to comment.

Both brothers refused to shut down the work after being confronted by the DEP according to an inspector’s report.

“[Greg] Antonelli became belligerent” the inspector wrote. “Several times he said ‘I’m not doing it that way.’ ""

Asbestos was left exposed in the residential neighborhood for a week the DEP alleges with cleanup completed about seven days before graduation.

Contractors must follow strict procedures for removal of asbestos which can break into microscopic fibers that remain suspended in the air and linger in the body for years.

Antonelli downplayed the risk in an interview.

“Did you think I was trying to crush up asbestos so that people would eat it and get sick?” Antonelli said. “Did you think I was trying to harm somebody? Imagine you’re talking about something that happened [four] years ago.”

Sams the attorney for GTA said the company has denied the asbestos allegations and has been otherwise successful. “GTA doesn’t have a blemish on their record either before or after” he said.

DeMaria insisted that he keeps his distance from contracting decisions and that Antonelli and other friends are not favored.

“We do everything right in the city of Everett when it comes to contracts and bidding” he said. “No one gets preferential treatment.”

But in text messages unearthed as evidence in the mayor’s defamation case Antonelli suggests he has a direct pipeline to city officials on contracts. In one message he complains that he is “doing parks and repaving roads for whatever price” the chief financial officer quotes him.

In an interview Antonelli maintained that he doesn’t have a single friend in City Hall. But he acknowledged that grievances and allegiances are always shifting in Everett a city he called “an entangled web.”

“You know the crazy thing about Everett? You fight with a person this month next month you’re best friends with them” Antonelli said. “It’s the craziest city around.”

The business based in Medford Mass. received a 1.232 percent six-year Job Creation Tax Credit from the Ohio Tax Credit Authority for the project. The business expects to open by fall said Brad Ehrhart president of the Portage County Development Board.

Ravenna Mayor Frank Seman said the company will use two-thirds of the 420500-square-foot building and will combine the plants from Boston and Youngstown. The company signed a 20-year lease he said.

""They intend to stay"" he said.

Boston expects to create 45 full-time positions generating $2.25 million in new annual payroll and retaining $1.2 million in existing payroll as a result of the company’s new project in Ravenna.

Last year Industrial Commercial Properties of Solon purchased the site six months after GE closed the distribution center which employed about 40 people. The same commercial real estate development company is redeveloping Chapel Hill Mall and the former Geauga Lake property.

The 420500-square-foot GE Lighting warehouse/distribution building is on 37.5 acres located at 150 Loomis Parkway in Ravenna. The land is on the north side of the city with close access to state Route 14. It is separate from the GE plant at 6800 N. Chestnut St. which closed in 2014. That facility was purchased by Ray Harner who turned the property into the Chestnut Commerce Center.

The source of the compound called eleutherobin has been vexing drug discoverers for a quarter century until it was found in common soft corals off the Florida coast — a mile from the researcher’s brother’s apartment.

The researchers were able to take the first steps towards recreating how the soft corals produce eleutherobin opening the door to potentially synthesizing the compound in large amounts in the future once they figure out the rest of the “recipe.”

“My hope is to one day hand these to a doctor” Utah postdoc Paul Scesa said. “I think of it as going from the bottom of the ocean to bench to bedside.”

Researchers discovered the compound 25 years ago and have been searching for the source since.

Maritime mystery: Eleutherobin was first isolated in the 1990s by UCSD and Bristol-Myers Squibb researchers studying a rare coral found near Bennett Shoal off Western Australia.

While doing routine analysis of the chemicals in the coral the team discovered the novel compound and found it “possessed significant cytotoxicity against a wide variety of cancer cells” they wrote in their study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

The chemical disrupts cellular scaffolding and it is used as a defense mechanism by the soft corals.

But researchers could not find enough eleutherobin in the coral to begin drug development with it and without a deeper understanding of its workings could not synthesize the compound in a lab.

Many scientists assumed it was created by the algae that live symbiotically in coral not the corals themselves.

“It didn’t make sense” Scesa said. “We knew that corals must make eleutherobin” because some corals don’t have symbiotic microorganisms but still have similar chemical signatures.

A native Floridian Scesa had spent his youth exploring the sea and suspected that soft corals he was familiar with could be a source of the compound bringing samples back to Salt Lake City — well above sea level.

Anti-cancer soft corals: Because of new advances in DNA sequencing technology the researchers were able to search the soft corals’ genome for the genetic code needed to create eleutherobin.

There was however a catch: they didn’t know what to look for.

“It’s like going into the dark and looking for an answer where you don’t know the question” U of U professor of medicinal chemistry Eric Schmidt said.

The researchers were able to take the first steps towards recreating how the soft corals produce eleutherobin opening the door to potentially synthesizing the compound in large amounts in the future.

To work around the hole the researchers looked for DNA in the soft corals that resembled the code needed to make similar compounds.

When bacteria were engineered to follow the coral codes they found they were able to synthesize the first steps towards creating eleutherobin proving the soft corals were the source and serving as a proof-of-concept for its ability to be made in a lab.

It’s still a long way from soft corals to cancer clinics however; the team next wants to figure out the rest of the recipe and optimize how to produce the large amounts needed for drug testing.

Its director he added is “recognised by international critics for his personal way of creating sickly atmospheres and psychological suspense with a reduced number of characters elements and settings as he showed in ‘The Corpse of Anna Fritz.’”

“Most people would not put their hands in the fire to argue that spirits do not exist” Hernández Vicens maintains in a director’s statement. Ghosts are the most authentic supernatural figure he adds. “The ghost in ’32 Gats’ has to be constructed from the most quotidian elements so that spectators could never be totally sure it exists.”

“This is a horror film but also a drama” Hernández Vicens said. “It’s a bet on genre the supernatural coming in from an angle of truth honesty and naturalism.”

Pushing the envelope even for genre “The Corpse of Ana Fritz” begins with what seems necrophilia as two friends one a mortician take advantage of a beautiful dead celebrity’s body in a morgue – a broad metaphor reviewers said at the time for the intrusiveness of internet culture into the intimacy of celebrities.

Once a poor ""skinny kid"" from Malaysia Hock Tan was going head-to-head with a legendary US technology mogul for a transformative acquisition.Tan placed a call earlier this month to VMware Inc Chairman Michael Dell  also the chief executive of computer maker Dell Technologies Inc.He proposed one of the biggest tie-ups in the history of the technology sector. Broadcom Inc the chip maker that Tan leads was willing to acquire VMware a cloud software company for $61 billion.For Tan now 70 the deal would be the culmination of a string of acquisitions that has helped him turn Broadcom into a technology conglomerate worth $225 billion along the way building a reputation as an astute dealmaker and ruthless cost-cutter.Dell who personally owns 40% of VMware and controls it together with buyout firm Silver Lake  had a decision to make. Hold out for a better deal or risk losing out as technology stocks plunged amid concerns about a looming economic slowdown and rampant inflation.Broadcom offered $61 billion in cash and stock for VMware a 50% premium to where the shares of the latter were trading. To clinch the deal Tan also agreed to give VMware 40 days from the signing of the deal to search for another suitor who may offer a better price. VMware said yes.This account of the negotiations is based on people involved in the deal who requested anonymity.Broadcom had been eyeing VMware for months but held off from making an approach because it was concerned that Dell and Silver Lake would not engage due to the timing of VMware's spin-off from Dell Technologies in November 2021. Shareholders risk losing the tax-free status of their spin-off if their company engages in sale talks in the first six months after the separation.Tan's cost-cutting reputation prompted VMware's chief executive Raghu Raghuram to write to his employees on the deal's announcement to assure them that the ""perception"" of Broadcom putting profits ahead of innovation was ""inaccurate"". He wrote that Tan ""is committed to cultivating a shared culture of innovation.""That reputation stems from Tan's strategy of acquiring businesses he calls ""franchises"" and then slashing what he sees as excessive sales and marketing expenses and unnecessary investments. He is also quick to jettison parts of those businesses that underperform.""He runs Broadcom like an investment portfolio ... they are all independent fiefdoms"" said a former employee at the company who worked closely with Tan. ""If he has a dominant position in any market he'll go in and raise those prices.""Tan and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.Tan has said he was an ""18-year-old skinny kid"" growing up in Malaysia when he won a scholarship in 1971 to attend engineering school at MIT. His parents could not afford to send him to college. He went on to earn an MBA from Harvard University.He held several executive positions in Malaysia and the United States before joining chip maker Integrated Circuit Systems in 1994 rising to become chief executive in 1999.It was Silver Lake that helped recruit Tan as chief executive of the company that would go on to become Broadcom. In 2006 Tan joined Avago Technologies a semiconductor company that Silver Lake and KKR Co Inc another buyout firm had acquired the year before for $2.66 billion.A spate of deals followed as Tan embarked on consolidating the semiconductor industry often with backing from Silver Lake. In 2014 Avago paid $6.6 billion for storage chipmaker LSI Corp. In 2015 it acquired Broadcom for $37 billion and took its name. In 2016 Broadcom acquired network gear maker Brocade Communications Systems Inc for $5.9 billion.In 2017 Broadcom launched a hostile $117 billion takeover bid for rival chipmaker Qualcomm Inc that would have been the largest technology deal of all time. It was thwarted by the U.S. government over concerns that Broadcom which was at the time headquartered in Singapore would become too dominant in the U.S. semiconductor industry at the expense of innovation.Tan then turned his attention to software companies which like semiconductors can generate reliable cash flow. Broadcom took over business software firm CA Technologies Inc for $18.9 billion and acquired Symantec Corp's security division for $10.7 billion.Following every acquisition Broadcom paid down much of the debt it had taken on to help fund it using the cash flow of its businesses. This has emboldened Tan to carry on with his spree of acquisitions said Matt Britzman analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.""Broadcom has de-levered quickly after each large acquisition"" Britzman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9oaWdoZXN0LXBhaWQtY2Vvcy1pbi1hbWVyaWNhLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The highest paid CEOs in America in 2021,"The world’s richest person also received the highest CEO compensation in 2021.

Elon Musk the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla topped Fortune‘s new list of the most highly compensated CEOs on the Fortune 500. In 2021 Musk “realized” compensation worth almost $23.5 billion from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018 multiyear “moonshot” grant. That was—by far—the biggest CEO payday in 2021 according to our new analysis of how Fortune 500 CEOs are compensated.

After Musk the 10 most highly compensated Fortune 500 CEOs of 2021 are all tech and biotech CEOs including the heads of Apple Netflix and Microsoft. The full list is below.

CEO pay dwarfs that of the average employee. The average big-company CEO made 351 times the pay of the average worker on a realized basis in 2020 according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) which has tracked the metric for decades up from a 21-to-1 ratio back in 1965.

Our analysis evaluated the pay packages of 280 Fortune 500 CEOs who earned a median total compensation of $15.9 million up 30% from a year earlier. When calculating a CEO’s total realized pay we measured the following for the company’s most recent fiscal year: salary and bonuses; other compensation such as vested restricted stock grants long-term incentive payouts and perks; and stock gains in the form of value realized from exercising stock options. Because the value of unexercised options is unpredictable we did not consider them in our tabulation of total compensation.

Here are the highest-paid CEOs.

1. Elon Musk Tesla: $23.5 billion

Musk the founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla “realized” compensation worth almost $23.5 billion in 2021 from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018.

Tesla ranked 65 on this year’s Fortune 500. The company had a blockbuster 2021 bringing in $53.8 billion in revenue up 71% from 2020 and expanding significantly into key European and Chinese markets. Tesla delivered 936000 vehicles in 2021 an 87% increase that puts the company at the pinnacle of the global EV industry with a 14% market share.

Musk did not respond to Fortune‘s requests for comment.

2. Tim Cook Apple: $770.5 million

Cook has been CEO of Apple Inc. since 2011. He earned $770.5 million in 2021 alone mostly as a part of a 10-year grant of shares worth $1.7 billion. But his incredible pay package may be justified by Apple’s stock market performance under Cook: The tech company’s market value during his tenure has increased by $2.2 trillion.

Apple ranks 3 on the Fortune 500. The company faced challenges because of the global chip shortage but successfully began manufacturing the equipment in-house. Apple finished the year with a gargantuan $95 billion in profits—outperforming every other U.S. company on that front.

Apple declined to comment on Fortune‘s analysis.

3. Jensen Huang NVIDIA $561 million

Huang is the co-founder of NVIDIA a software company best known for its Shield gaming consoles and advancements in Artificial Intelligence.

The company ranked 134 on this year’s Fortune 500. Revenue surged 61.4%.

A spokesperson acknowledged that during the latest fiscal year Huang “realized about $507 million from expiring options that had been granted in 2011 and 2012 reflecting the approximately 60x increase in the company’s share price over the [past] decade.”

4. Reed Hastings Netflix: $453.5 million

Netflix ranked 115 on the Fortune 500 with an 18.8% change in revenue. The company has recently cut costs after losing subscribers as the world re-opens after the pandemic. Netflix also faces increased competition from streaming services.

A spokesperson disputed Fortune‘s analysis of Hastings’ realized pay and would only reiterate the total value of his “granted” compensation for 2021: “Per our proxy statement his compensation in 2021 was $40.8 million with $650000 in cash and $39.7 million in stock options.”

5. Leonard Schleifer Regeneron Pharmaceuticals: $452.9 million

The company ranked 231 on this year’s Fortune 500. Revenue rose 89.1% in 2021 driven by the company’s REGEN-COV antibody treatment for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

A spokesperson noted that the bulk of Schleifer’s realized pay per Fortune‘s analysis “reflects the exercise of long-held options that were reaching their ten-year expiration point” and said “Regeneron’s compensation philosophy has always emphasized long-term incentives in the form of stock options and other equity-based awards as we believe this aligns employee interests with the typically long-term nature of drug development.”

6. Marc Benioff Salesforce: $439.4 million

Many of Nadella’s peers likely believe he deserves a huge payday. This year Nadella was voted the “most underrated” CEO for the sixth consecutive year according to the survey behind Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies. Nadella has headed that list since 2017.

Microsoft posted a robust 38% increase in profits last year—earning $61 billion the fourth-largest sum among Fortune 500 companies—as revenue rose 17.5% to $168 billion thanks to a successful Surface laptop and tablet launch. The company which ranked 14 on this year’s 500 also grappled with a chip shortage that challenged Xbox game consoles.

Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.

Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick earned $296.7 million last year according to our calculations from the value realized on vested restricted stock. Despite rampant employee complaints and several lawsuits over sexism harassment and Kotick’s personal mismanagement of assault claims at the game developer Microsoft in January agreed to buy Activision for $68.7 billion in what would be its largest acquisition to date.

In an emailed statement a spokesperson reiterated that Activision Blizzard had valued Kotick’s “granted” (but not realized) compensation in 2021 at $826549. She noted that Kotick had reduced his salary to $62500 last year and praised his 31-year tenure for making Activision “one of the most successful global gaming com- panies in the world.”

J. Simpson for seven years. Reports suggest that the couple divorced in 1992 and two years later she and her friend Ron Goldman were brutally stabbed to death. O. J. Simpson was the main suspect in this double murder. Even though authorities arrested him and put him on trial the court controversially acquitted him.

Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman were murdered in her condo at 875 South Bundy Drive in Brentwood Los Angeles California. Since this tragedy this home has been scrutinized by many individuals. According to People Magazine its new owners completely transformed its shrubbery in 1997 rendering the murder site unrecognizable. Furthermore its address was changed in an attempt to cleanse its ugly reputation. It has also been sold multiple times.

Nicole Brown Simpson’s life and death will be the subject of an upcoming Lifetime docuseries titled The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson. Per IMDb its synopsis reads “Nicole Brown Simpson’s sisters and closest friends break their silence about her murder and O.J. Simpson’s controversial trial aiming to shed light on the truth.”

How many times was Nicole Brown Simpson’s condo sold?

Nicole Brown Simpson’s four-bedroom four-bath 3400 sq. ft townhouse was built in 1991. It first sold for $625000 in January 1994 five months before the murder. However two years after Nicole and Ron’s deaths the condo sold for a reduced price of $525000. According to People Magazine the condo was purchased again in 2006 but this time for a whopping $1.72 million. In total this infamous house has been sold three times.

In a 1997 conversation with the LA Times a resident of that area stated that Brentwood would forever be infamous for the double murders. He said “Brentwood is always going to have this ghost hanging over it — the place of the O.J. murders.”

O. J. Simpson died due to cancer on April 10 2024 at the age of 76.

Two of the biggest players in the electronics design automation segment of the semiconductor industry are Cadence Design (CDNS -0.52%) and Synopsys (SNPS 0.16%). In this video clip from the ""Semiconductor Revolution"" show on Motley Fool Live recorded on May 19 Fool.com contributor Nick Rossolillo outlines several metrics that make them high-performing stocks.

10 stocks we like better than Cadence Design Systems

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Cadence Design Systems wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of April 27 2022

Nicholas Rossolillo: Two companies that I'm going to highlight here very briefly Cadence Design and Synopsys. These are the two heavy hitters in this space. You can think of them essentially like Autodesk of the semiconductor industry. These are software companies that help semiconductor firms design and test their chips. They help with integration of chips into a larger computing unit that help with actual software system verification like to make sure the chip is running the software properly. All sorts of cool stuff.

Because it's software again the nitpicky thing with the semiconductor industry is that it's cyclical. That these are like subscription software businesses so you get the nice steady increase in revenue from a software business but they service the semiconductor industry.

These are two really interesting stocks if you're looking for a bet on chips but you don't want to play that cyclical game where one year you're having booming sales and then maybe the next you flatline or have a decline in sales. That can be a roller coaster for some of these chip companies but that's not really going to happen with these two.

Just some quick highlights. You can see both of them very very high gross profit margins. Lots of free cash flow in the last couple of years. Again a software each incremental sale that they make most of that money just goes directly to the bottom line super-efficient operating model. Both of them have lots of cash.

Synopsys I haven't finished doing a complete update because they actually just reported on earnings the other day. I thought it was a little bit unfair maybe to compare Synopsys with an extra quarter of results compared to Cadence Design over the last couple of years. But the long and the short here is both of these companies are I think fantastic.

I don't know that you necessarily need to pick one or the other I think Cadence Design is a popular pick around the Fool. I know I've covered it on a handful of times. But you you're going to get very similar results from both of these stocks I believe. So you can buy both of them or just pick one if you want more stable business performance from the chip industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtYmVkZGVkLmNvbS9lbWJlZGRlZC1uZXdzLWZpcnN0LWRlbW8tb2YtYXJtLWNvcnRleC1tODUtYXV0b21vdGl2ZS1pbXUtd2l0aC1tbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,embedded news: first demo of Arm Cortex-M85 automotive IMU with ML,"Advertisement

In the process chip design will be democratized in line with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that – Design in India is as important as Make in India.

Understanding chip design as a strategic necessity a pilot deployment was successfully tested by MeitY earlier in 2021 under Special Manpower Development Programme for Chips to System Design (SMDP-C2SD) wherein a centralized design facility at C-DAC was enabled for remote access by over 50000 engineering students at 60 academic institutions for designing chips. Leapfrogging MeitY now intends to make accessible a centralized chip design infrastructure to be made available at India Chip Centre setup at C-DAC to train 85000+ B.Tech M.Tech and PhD students at 120 academic institutions across the country in chip design area for next 5 years.

For making available the chip design infrastructure at India Chip Centre (C-DAC) leading industry vendors from EDA (Electronic Design Automation) Electronic Computer-Aided Design (ECAD) IP Core and Design solutions Industry are being partnered with. Specific collaborative arrangements are being made available with Synopsys Cadence Design Systems Siemens EDA Silvaco & other leading tool vendors IP & design solution providers and Fab aggregators.

At centralized design facility hosted at India Chip Centre (C-DAC) not only the most advanced tools for entire chip design cycle (i.e. Front-end design Back-end design PCB design & analysis etc. for Digital Analog RF & Mixed Signal designs) going up to 7nm or advanced node but also an arrangement of instructor-led/ online trainings on design flows by industry professionals are being made available for next 5 years.

This centralized facility at India Chip Centre (C-DAC) one of the biggest of existing facilities offering plethora of design flows aims to bring the chip design infrastructure at door-steps of over 85000 students at 120 academic institutions. Taking advantage several academic start-ups will mushroom across the country cross the initial entry barriers and pave the way for entrepreneurship/ startup-led design & innovations ecosystem in the country making indigenous IP Cores Chips System on Chip (SoCs) Systems for different application areas like 5G/ IoT AI/ ML Automotive & Mobility sector etc. in India for the World.

As SemiconIndia 2022 concluded successfully last week most of the global semiconductor leaders (like Intel Micron Qualcomm LAM Research etc) not only highlighted the contribution of their Indian R&D centres which are now the biggest centres out of their headquarter locations but also acknowledged the semiconductor design strength in our country which now makes up for 20% of the world’s engineers.

Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw Minister for Electronics & Information Technology envisions making available a design talent pool of highly skilled engineers for turning India into a semiconductor hub through the Chips to Startup (C2S) Programme and other initiatives in Semiconductor policy. This will strengthen & supplement the Indian talent pool designing the leading-edge chips for semiconductor giants with complete ownership of some of these chips in the country. Speaking at SemiconIndia 2022 he highlighted that India’s democracy and talent pool sets it apart from other countries fighting for chip sovereignty.

Many co-development pacts were announced at SemiconIndia 2022 last week by Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar Minister of State for Electronics & Information Technology including Digital India RISC-V (DIR-V) Program aiming to catalyze India’s semiconductor ecosystem. These announcements coupled with the fact that India has just scored a century of Unicorns this week and the steps taken to democratize the chip design across the country shall trigger the next wave of Startups and unicorns from semiconductor design space in the country.",,,,,,

Forget heartbreak—somehow romance feels good in a place like this!

Keith Urban posted an adorable video on Instagram of his wife Nicole Kidman making a surprise appearance during his Las Vegas concert on May 28. The ""Wild Hearts"" singer was in the middle of performing at The Colosseum in Caesars Palace when his longtime love joined him onstage.

In the clip Nicole was met by her husband and the pair who have been married for almost 16 years shared a hug and kiss. When asked if she'd like to speak into the microphone the Moulin Rouge! star bashfully said ""Hi.""

""What's your name?"" Keith joked. ""Where are you from?""

Dressed in a vest tank top and a pair of skinny jeans Nicole began to laugh before she sweetly replied ""Nicole Urban.""

That caught Keith's attention. The musician—who sported a light gray t-shirt black skinny jeans and boots—excitedly remarked ""Oh cool!""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZm9jdXNnbi5jb20vODg4LXRha2VzLXNhZmVyLWdhbWJsaW5nLWNvbnRyb2wtY2VudHJlLXRvLWl0YWx50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,888 takes safer gambling Control Centre to Italy,"The UK gaming company has expanded its safer gambling measures to cover the Italian market.

Italy.- The gaming company 888 has announced the expansion of its safer gambling initiative to Italy. It’s rolled out its Control Centre in the market as part of its ESG policy dubbed “Made to Play Safely” as part of its “Made for the Future” initiative.

The Control Centre was launched in the UK market in 2020. It offers real-time gambling activity monitoring deposit limits self-exclusion limits and “take a break” restrictions. The company said it aims to normalise the use of safer gambling tools among players.

888’s VP for customer safety and due diligence Andrew Anthony said: “I am delighted to see The Control Centre rolled out in another of our core markets. At 888 we recognise the need to use our proprietary technology to protect customers and promote safer play.

“By giving customers transparent information about their gambling activity in real time we continue to ensure that safer gambling remains at the heart of the 888 customer experience.”

888 says the Control Centre led to a 23 per cent increase in the use of safer gambling tools in 2021 and that players who used the centre were more likely to adjust personal deposit limits and to “take a break” from gaming.

Anthony added: “We are focused on ensuring that our customers are empowered to make safe and responsible decisions about their gambling and we remain committed to continually investing in our teams and technology to create industry-leading user-friendly tools that help achieve this.

“We look forward to introducing The Control Centre across more markets over the coming years.”

888 shareholders approve William Hill acquisition

Earlier this month the shareholders of 888 Holdings approved the company’s deal to acquire the non-US assets of William Hill from the US casino giant Caesars Entertainment. Caesars bought William Hill last year for £2.9bn but made clear from the outset that it would offload the European part of the business.

888 reached a deal to buy those assets in September but since William Hill’s assets are larger than 888’s current business the deal is classified as a reverse takeover needing approval from 888’s shareholders. The result of that is 307 million votes – 99.7 per cent of voting shares – in favour and only 819264 against. 888 expects to complete the deal on or around June 30.

888 Holdings reached an agreement for a reduced price for the acquisition saving it £250m £100m of which will be kept as a 2024 earn-out incentive depending on EBITDA performance.",,,

The more you travel the more confusing it all is. I recently had a reader ask me about tipping etiquette when dining in American Airlines Flagship First Dining so I figured I’d answer that question more broadly.

Should you tip in airport lounges and if so under what circumstances is it appropriate and/or expected?

Tipping in airport lounges is never expected

Let me state upfront that tipping is never expected in an airport lounge anywhere in the world. In other words it’s not like dining in a restaurant in the United States where you’re a jerk if you (knowingly) don’t tip as servers often aren’t even being paid minimum wage before tips.

As you might expect though the custom of tipping in airport lounges is very different depending on where in the world you are. So while no one tips in airport lounges in Japan a lot of people do tip in airport lounges in the United States.

While tipping is never expected in airport lounges in the United States:

It certainly is appreciated for some kinds of services

People working in airport lounges are at least paid minimum wage (unlike restaurant servers) but of course minimum wage and a livable wage aren’t the same thing

For many airport lounge employees tipping does make a significant difference to their bottom line and ability to provide for themselves and their family

You might think it’s mostly Americans tipping but that’s not my understanding; based on what I’ve been told it’s just as much foreigners partly because they might not be familiar with US customs (other than knowing that you’re supposed to constantly tip) and also since they may have some leftover currency and might be leaving the country

Never feel like you have to tip but also realize that tipping is appreciated under many circumstances and it is a common practice.

American Flagship First Dining DFW

Under what circumstances should you tip in airport lounges?

Generally speaking under what circumstances are tips common in airport lounges? I’d say there are a few different situations so let’s go over those. I’m just sharing my take and observations though again I’m not claiming there’s a right or wrong answer.

When you are served a drink

In many airport lounges drinks are served by bartenders so if you want a glass of wine or a cocktail they’ll have to serve you. It’s not unusual to see people tip $1-3 per drink with the lower end being common for pouring a glass of wine and the higher end being common for a custom cocktail.

I know that some people who choose to sit at the bar in an airport lounge may just tip $20 upfront and then they get amazing service the entire time. I’m not saying people should do that but it is a common practice.

I’d say a similar tipping etiquette applies for the custom avocado toast station in the Admirals Club especially if you don’t want them to be stingy with toppings. 😉

Many people will tip in airport lounge bars

When you have a sit-down meal

In the past several years we’ve seen an increase of airlines offering a la carte dining in lounges whether we’re talking about American Flagship First Dining or United Polaris Lounges. This is a lovely experience and in many cases offers restaurant-quality food drinks and service.

Assuming service is friendly and attentive I’ll generally tip $10-20 depending on how much I eat and drink. Usually I try to tip around 20% of what I think a meal like that would cost in a restaurant outside an airport. I consider it to be a small price to pay for a great experience.

While we’re at it there are many Priority Pass restaurants nowadays where select Priority Pass memberships offer a certain dollar credit toward a meal. In those situations you absolutely should tip in the United States since the credit is just another form of payment.

Tipping for a sit-down meal is appropriate

When you get a spa treatment

Some airport lounges do offer complimentary spa treatments which is always a treat. Tipping is appreciated here and I’ll usually tip $5-10 for a mini-treatment. I try to think of how much a similar treatment would cost if paying cash and then use the same 20% tipping rule.

Many people tip for airport spa treatments

When you get exceptional service

Even without a la carte dining or spa treatments sometimes you have lounge employees who simply go above and beyond. They’ll constantly check on you see if you want anything to drink clear plates constantly etc. Rumana at the Capital One Lounge DFW is the perfect example of this.

In these situations I think tipping as a sign of gratitude is a nice gesture though also certainly not expected. Most of the people who are this friendly do so because they genuinely want to make other people happy and not because they’re hoping to get a tip.

Tipping for exceptional service seems reasonable

What about lounge tipping outside the United States?

As mentioned above the above guidelines are mostly for lounges in the United States since we have a culture of tipping. What about outside the United States? Obviously I wouldn’t tip in a place like Japan for any services as it would be considered rude.

What about aside from that though? I typically don’t tip in airport lounges outside the United States with the exception of when getting spa treatments. I personally feel good about tipping in those situations though I also think it’s totally reasonable to not tip.

Aside from that I don’t typically tip for dining and drinks in the same way I would in the United States.

I don’t tip in lounges outside the US in the same way

Bottom line

Tipping is never expected in airport lounges. However depending on where in the world you are it’s also not necessarily unusual to do so. In the United States it’s common to see people tipping a couple of dollars when a bartender pours a drink or tipping a bit more than that for a sit-down meal or a spa treatment in an airport lounge.

Airport lounge employees are consistently paid at least minimum wage (unlike most restaurant workers) and many airports even have high minimum wages. However a high minimum wage still isn’t going to be a livable wage in many places.

I know that in some lounges guests tipping makes a material difference in how much people make and helps airport lounges retain some good talent.

And let me say that even though I have my general “system” I’m also not 100% consistent. Sometimes I don’t have small bills (or any cash) so I won’t tip. But I try to make up for it the next time in hopes of it all balancing out.

What’s your approach to tipping in airport lounges?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9ib29raW5nLXFzdWl0ZS10by1tYWxkaXZlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to book Qatar Qsuites to the Maldives for just 85K points,"Qatar Qsuites are in the discussion for the best business class seat in the sky.

Now that Qatar Airways has joined the Avios loyalty program with British Airways there's never been an easier way to book Qsuites to aspirational destinations such as the Maldives. Let's take a look at how to do it.

Why it's special

Qsuite. (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Qsuites are a bucket list item on the list of many points and miles collectors. Qatar Airways operates its Qsuites to lots of fun routes around the world like Cape Town Bangkok Tokyo and Paris.

Perhaps the most enticing Qsuites destination is the Maldives. It's an award traveler's paradise with jaw-dropping five-star resorts in every direction — many of which can be reserved for free if you've got the right points.

There are two common ways to book Qsuites to the Maldives:

Via the British Airways site for 105000 Avios points each way

Via the American Airlines site for 70000 miles each way

But the sweetest spot of all is now with Qatar Airways Avios. You can fly from the U.S. to the Maldives in lie-flat Qsuites for 85000 points each way. The cash price for these flights depends on your route but never expect to pay less than $6000 round-trip for your ticket. And one-way flights can sometimes cost more than a round-trip. Expect to get a value of at least 3.5 cents per point for your Qatar Avios — a full 2 cents higher than TPG's valuation of Avios at 1.5 cents each.

The reason we consider this a better deal than the 70000-mile American Airlines option is because Qatar Avios are exponentially easier to earn. There are only a handful of ways to quickly earn American Airlines miles — but there are dozens of ways to quickly earn Qatar Airways Avios (as we'll cover below).

How to book this award

Step 1. Log into your Qatar Airways account

You'll have to sign into your Qatar Airways account to search for available award flights. Might as well get it out of the way immediately.

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Step 2. Click on ""Spend your Avios""

From the navigation bar at the top click the ""Privilege Club"" tab. You'll see a ""Spend"" category to the far right of the page. Click ""Spend your Avios.""

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Step 3. Click ""Book Now""

You're now taken to a page that lists all the ways you can spend your Qatar Avios. The first option is ""Book award flights."" That's the one you want.

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Step 4. Enter your travel details

On this page you can choose whether you want to book flights on Qatar Airways or its partner airlines. If you're after Qsuites stay on the ""Redeem on Qatar Airways/British Airways"" tab.

Qatar flies its Qsuites to a handful of U.S. cities including:

Atlanta

Boston

Chicago

Dallas

Houston

Los Angeles

Miami

New York

Philadelphia

San Francisco

Washington D.C.

Choose one of these airports. If there's no availability for your desired dates choose the next most convenient. In my opinion it's worth flying to another U.S. airport to catch a flight in Qsuites to your destination.

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Step 5. Find seats that aren't ""Flexi awards""

On the results page you'll see some awards with a ""Q2"" flag next to them (representing Flexi awards) and some without. The awards without the Flexi awards flag cost 85000 Avios in total to reach the Maldives in Qsuites. The awards with the flag cost 170000 Avios — double the price.

(Screenshot from qatarairways.com)

Step 6. Choose your seats and book them

You can consult our ultimate guide to Qatar Qsuites to see which flights offer Qsuites. Just note that Qatar can swap aircraft at will so even if you've done everything right you may not get a Qsuite.

Per our ultimate guide flight QR 756 from Atlanta to Doha and flight QR 672 from Doha to Male are theoretically Qsuites. You should be able to tell if your flight is a Qsuite when selecting your seats. Or you can check ExpertFlyer (owned by TPG's parent company Red Ventures) to preview seat maps before you purchase.

As long as you select flights without the Q2 flag your award price should be 85000 one-way — and often around $200 in taxes and fees.

Spending $200 in taxes isn't ideal. But for a flight that otherwise costs $6000+ it's a nominal fee.

As you might already know the charity golf outing will pit Patrick Mahomes II and Josh Allen against Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. This will be the sixth rendition of “The Match” — and the debut for Mahomes and Allen.

Brady and Rodgers have already competed in the event but never on the same team. In fact Rodgers bested Brady alongside professional golfer Bryson DeChambeau last summer. TB12 was paired with Phil Mickelson at the time.

Rodgers Crosses the Line

Up until this week most of the back-and-forth banter on social media has been pretty friendly but Rodgers and Brady decided to turn it up a notch on May 27. Bleacher Report tweeted out the remarks which they labeled as “roasting” the AFC duo.

“Kermit the Frog and Josh trying to s*** talk me and Tom… Come on” Rodgers stated boldly.

It’s not exactly a new joke to say Mahomes sounds like Kermit the Frog but it’s still a bit of a cheap shot when the Chiefs QB has been much more humble during the build-up to the event. Brady then followed up by ripping Allen.

“Josh really hasn’t backed up much on the football field in his career” he added “especially playing against me.”

Ouch. Mahomes and Allen have yet to respond on social media taking a more silent approach ahead of the golf outing.

Brady & Rodgers Are Still Favorites

With all the experience on their side Brady and Rodgers are the clear favorites to win “The Match VI.”

The betting odds were lopsided at -240 in favor of Team Brady (+180 Team Mahomes) on May 25 according to Covers but they have actually begun to even out a bit. Now the veterans are favored at -190 according to Sporting News with the young guns at +155.

Aside from playing in “The Match” before Brady and Rodgers are also in their 40s and have spent much more time on the golf course over the years. The 26-year-old competitors have a combined age of 52.

Brady and Rodgers also destroyed Mahomes and Allen during a pre-Match chipping challenge but that’s only one aspect of the game. When asked about how they could be victorious on April 18 Mahomes implied he and Allen would rely on their distance with the driver — or the “little wedges” when the hole allows a smaller club.

“I think the reason we’re going to win is we’re going to be able to play the course a little differently than old Tom and old Aaron over there” the Chiefs superstar voiced. “They’re going to be playing it nice and easy. They might get us on a couple of par 3’s and stuff like that but whenever we can really open it up and use the drivers it’s going to be nice to be able to use our little wedges while they’re using their six irons. That’ll help us a little bit.”

No matter the situation Mahomes and Allen aren’t the types to shy away from defying the odds. They’ll have to do so once again if they intend to pull off an upset on Wednesday evening.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RpcHMtc29sby10cmF2ZWwtZWd5cHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 tips I wish I knew before traveling on my own to Egypt,"Egypt is a magical place that attracts travelers from all over the globe. Most tourists go there to see the pyramids in Giza but you'd be remiss if you didn't branch out beyond Cairo's famous sites.

Traveling throughout Egypt can be a bit tricky. Fortunately with a bit of research and careful planning you can minimize the likelihood of encountering any unexpected surprises during your visit.

Here are some tips to keep in mind before you visit based on my solo travels around Egypt.

Know what to expect when it comes to money

Overall Egypt is an affordable destination with most meals costing less than $5. However be wary of scams and being overcharged. If you plan to shop which you should at Khan el-Khalili in Cairo be prepared to haggle. Never pay the first price offered by a local vendor and use your bargaining skills to get whatever you're purchasing for a little bit cheaper.

Also be sure to pack cash. Although this is standard advice for just about everywhere it's especially crucial in Egypt as you'll be expected to leave a hefty tip in Egyptian pounds (the country's currency) for every service you partake in and receive.

Dress appropriately

While you may be tempted to whip out your short shorts due to the scalding heat Egypt is not the place to do so as it's a conservative country. Wear clothes that go at least past your knees do not show any cleavage and make sure to cover your shoulders especially at holy sites. Female tourists are not expected to wear a hijab though they can choose to do so out of respect. It is recommended for women to wear baggy clothes.

Bring a light jacket if your visit is during winter. Despite popular belief Egypt does indeed get chilly. Wear comfortable walking shoes and don't repeat my mistake of wearing cute sandals while temple hopping in Luxor. Some tombs are underground with a steep slope downward so good footwear is essential.

Take advantage of student discounts

Most of Egypt's archaeological sites like the pyramids temples and more charge an entry fee. These fees can add up over time especially if you're trying to see several throughout your trip as you should. I visited Egypt when I was a law student and my guide in Luxor informed me there is a student discount. However some sites wouldn't accept my New York City student ID card.

To avoid a U.S. state ID not being accepted you can look into getting an international student ID card (or an ISIC) which will likely be accepted at all sites in Egypt. The only caveat is you have to be younger than 26 to qualify for the Egyptian student discount.

Sample the country's food and beverages

Sampling local cuisine is always a big treat when traveling. In Egypt the delicious fare is seemingly endless. You'll find a variety of vegetarian and vegan dishes in the country including falafel and fül a stew of cooked fava beans made with olive oil parsley cumin and garlic that's typically eaten for breakfast. You should also try koshari Egypt's national dish. It's a wonderfully tasty concoction of pasta rice chickpeas lentils and fried onions served in a spicy tomato sauce.

Tap water is not recommended for drinking here so opt for a bottled beverage to wash down your meal. Despite being a predominantly Muslim nation where many locals abstain from drinking alcohol Egypt produces its own wine and beer so you'll have a few alcoholic options to choose from. If you want to indulge after a long day of sightseeing most hotels serve alcohol or you can order it online through the popular Egyptian site Cheers. Know though that being intoxicated in public is a big no-no.

Come prepared with layers

There's a common misconception that Egypt is extremely hot year-round. While the country undoubtedly gets hot much of the year it does indeed have a cooler season from December to late March so bring a light jacket if you're planning a winter visit.

Know too that Egypt is a large country so the weather may vary depending on where you are in the country.

Hire a guide

Egypt is an attractive tourist destination thanks to its rich history which can be traced back to some of the earliest signs of communication. Self-research is always an option but if you want to make the most of your Egypt experience consider hiring a guide to explain the many sites you'll see to you. It can be overwhelming to view pyramids hieroglyphics mummies and more on your own. A certified Egyptologist will ensure you know what you're looking at and can deepen your connection to the country's history.

Additionally a local guide who speaks the language can help you navigate unwanted attention especially for women traveling on their own. Catcalling is unfortunately common in Egypt but touring with a guide might eliminate some of the harassment experienced. If you're a woman traveling alone and you're uncomfortable hiring a male guide don't fret: I was pleasantly surprised to find many female guides available for hire when I visited.

Plan your itinerary and in-country transportation ahead of time

There's more to Egypt than just Cairo. In fact many travelers only spend a day or two in Cairo to see the pyramids before venturing out to other destinations. There are several ways to travel throughout the country but you'll need to narrow down where you'd like to go before deciding how you'll get there.

Luxor like Cairo is an obvious choice for most since it offers some of the best and most popular sites in the country. If you're into scuba diving or snorkeling any of the towns along the Red Sea should be on your radar. The most popular spots for water activities are Sharm el-Sheikh Hurghada and Dahab. And if you're feeling adventurous head east toward the Libyan border to discover the magical Siwa Oasis where you can float in one of the area's famous salt pools.

Other popular destinations in Egypt include Abu Simbel Aswan and Alexandria.

Once you narrow down where you'd like to go you'll then have to decide how you'll get there. Traveling throughout Egypt via EgyptAir is incredibly easy as there are flights connecting throughout most major cities at affordable rates. An overnight sleeper train is another popular way to travel due to its relatively low cost or you can get a unique perspective of the country by enjoying a relaxing Nile River cruise.

Renting a car is an option too. However it's not recommended due to heavy traffic lack of speed limit enforcement and the presence of police checkpoints throughout the country. Should you need to get around in a car consider hailing a taxi or ordering an Uber.

Use the right photography tools and equipment

Getting photos with no one else in them can be a challenge due to the large volume of visitors that flock to the main tourist sites so you may want to work on your photoshop skills. Most sites are grandiose in size so a wide-angle lens will serve you well.

Remember that drones are prohibited. If you attempt to bring one to the airport it will be confiscated.

Bottom line

Egypt is a thrill.

While you may want to brush up on your Arabic — it's the national language there — and check to see if you need any vaccinations (like one for yellow fever which is required if you're not traveling directly to Egypt from the U.S.) these preparations are more than worth the effort to visit this culturally and historically rich destination.

As long as you practice general safety precautions you should be all set to have the time of your life."

Cardinal Angelo Sodano died Friday at the age of 94 in Rome according to Vatican News.

The news agency said the cardinal had been hospitalized for pneumonia earlier in the month after testing positive for Covid-19. He had been in poor health for some time.

In a telegram sent to the cardinal’s sister on Saturday Pope Francis expressed his condolences.

“I recall his diligent work alongside so many of my predecessors who entrusted him with important responsibilities in the Vatican diplomacy up to the delicate office of secretary of state” Francis said.

Sodano was a long-time Vatican presence having served two popes as secretary of state and as dean of the College of Cardinals. He remained influential even in retirement.

But he faced severe criticism during the church sexual abuse crisis. In 2005 during a meeting with then-US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice he reportedly asked her to intervene in a sexual abuse lawsuit in the state of Kentucky which named the Vatican as a defendant. But she declined the National Catholic Reporter said at the time.

Despite telling its guests in a letter delivered to their cabins on the burnt ship that it intended to send them home “as soon as possible” Carnival decided to sail the Carnival Conquest from Florida all the way to Grand Turk to transport the cruise guests back to Port Canaveral.

We first reported on the fire on Thursday morning:

This slow method of transporting cruise guests is reminiscent of the way that Carnival treated its crew members during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Carnival forced the unpaid crew to travel to their far-away homes in the Philippines and Indonesia via Carnival cruise ships because the cruise giant was simply too cheap to fly them home by jets.

Carnival claims in a letter to the guests (text below) that the crew “quickly extinguished” the fire which occurred while the ship was dockside in Grand Turk. As you can see the crew used firehoses which were unable to stream water to reach the top of the funnel. You can clearly see the water falling 20 to 50 feet short of the funnel fire.

The Quickly Extinguished is absolutely hilarious. Those fire hoses couldn't even reach the blaze. It likely just burned itself out. Gotta love PR teams bull**** letters they sent out to prevent compensation. — A-Aron (@Buffbillsfan94) May 27 2022

Incredibly although some passengers assembled on the ship and wore life jackets (which were not needed because the burning ship was docked in port) there was no order to evacuate passengers or non-essential crew members as the ship burned. Countless videos posted on Twitter show the guests videotaping the spectacle and staying on the ship. At least one experienced master mariner said that Carnival failed to follow the International Safety Management (ISM) “Policies and Procedures” with respect to the immediate “muster accountability and evacuation” of all persons passenger and crew not essential to the emergency response to that stack fire. Fortunately no one was injured or killed by Carnival’s inadequate response to the fire.

The large fire did cause extensive damage to the Carnival cruise ship which will require that the ship go into the shipyard in Freeport Bahamas.

The only thing that Carnival did “quickly” was to look after its own financial interests. It quickly decided against chartering airplanes to transport its guests home which would cost several millions of dollars to fly the several thousands of guests by jets back to Florida.

As much as Carnival Cruise Line touts that all of its cruise ships are now back in business the reality is that this is a cruise line which is straining under crippling debt. As we mentioned last week its parent company Carnival Corporation is indebted to its lenders in the astounding amount of nearly $35000000000 ($34.9 billion). It is faced with selling its Seabourn brand in order to staff afloat as we mentioned last week. Saving money is probably what also motivated the cruise line not not extend a full refund to its affected guests. instead Carnival offered only a cruise credit of just 50% off a future cruise and a few other perks.

Of course trying to safe money got Carnival into this mess in the first place. In September of 2020 Carnival Cruise Line terminated thousands of crew members and over 100 senior shipboard officers. Many of these officers were the most experience engineers in its fleet of ships. The poor maintenance of the Carnival Freedom and the cause of the fire are probably a result of Carnival’s financial cutbacks.

In the past similar cruise ship fires resulted in some cruise lines offering full refunds. For example Royal Caribbean’s Grandeur of the Seas experienced a disabling fire in May of 2013. Royal Caribbean quickly arranged for flights for all guests back from the Bahamas. This cruise line extended 100% refunds to the guests and offered a certificate for a future cruise.

Immediately after the fire Royal Caribbean International’s CEO at the time Adam Goldstein (left) jumped on a jet to the Bahamas where he quickly met up with the burned ship. Mr. Goldstein was photographed inspecting the scene of the fire and discussing the fire while drinking iced tea with the passengers. He apologized profusely and promised improvements to his ships. This was an example of how a cruise line executive should act – quickly flying to the scene of the disaster showing leadership and demonstrating responsibility while exhibiting transparency and concern for his guests.

But Carnival’s response to this fire was handled differently. Carnival handled the embarrassing debacle much like it usually handles its other sordid conduct with a lack of transparency and lots of self-praise by its public relations personnel. Invariably Carnival always focuses primarily on its increasingly shaky bottom line. Carnival handled the fiasco in its typical penny-pinching cheap and thoughtless manner – something that only an accountant or other type of bean counter could have come up with.

The public has heard nothing from Carnival Corporation’s outgoing CEO Arnold Donald who announced that he’s leaving Carnival this August to be replaced by chief operation officer (and chief bean counter) Josh Weinstein.

Carnival Cruise is a dumpster fire. The first and last time I was on one a woman I met told she wasn’t drinking bc she was pregnant and then proceeded to light up a cigarette. pic.twitter.com/0nwywkIBFh — TVC (@SmallBizReTwit) May 27 2022

Was it Mr. Donald who has endured having to stand before U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Seitz during the quarterly hearings in federal court where his corporation has been convicted of numerous felonies for polluting the oceans and violating criminal parole for the past five years who made the short-sighted decision not to refund its guests their cruise fares for their ruined vacations? Or were CEO Donald’s subordinate bean counters the decision makers who decided not to offer their loyal Carnival cruise passengers a full refund?

I suppose that Carnival’s cheap offer could have been worse. Carnival at least extended the all-you-can-drink packages and authorized $100 credit (per stateroom not passenger) for the guests. So perhaps they can stay drunk when they had to pack their bags and climb aboard another Carnival cruise ship earlier this afternoon to cruise back to Florida for the two extra days it will take at this point to get to an airport in the U.S. and fly safely back home.

If the Carnival letter is too small and/or blurry to read the letter says:

Dear Carnival Freedom Guest

As you know earlier this morning Carnival Freedom’s emergency response team quickly extinguished a fire inside the ship’s funnel. Our safety protocols worked as planned and all safety systems and hotel services continued functioning normally. All guests and crew are safe.

“We have been in regular contact with our Fleet Operations Center in Miami and all the appropriate authorities have been notified. Our technical team from Miami will be joining the ship later today to conduct a technical assessment and plan for the necessary repairs which will be made at the shipyard in Grand Bahama. This means that Carnival Freedom will not be sailing back to Port Canaveral.

In order to get you home as soon as possible we have made arrangements to send Carnival Conquest to Grand Turk to sail back to Port Canaveral. Carnival Conquest (sister ship to Carnival Freedom) will arrive in Grand Turk on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. and will sail Saturday evening after embarkation has been completed. Carnival Conquest will arrive in Port Canaveral on Monday morning. We understand this extends the time you had planned to be away from home and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this delay may cause you.

Of course the extra days of cruise and gratuities are on us! Additionally guests who purchased Wi-Fi and beverage packages will have their packages extended on a complimentary basis. In addition we will be posting a US$100 per stateroom on board credit so you have some extra funds to spend over these next few days. Additionally since we’d love nothing more that to welcome you back you will receive a 50% future cruise credit.

Any additional parking fees in the Port Canaveral Parking Garage will also be waived. In the event you incur any expenses associated with independent non refundable air expenses/change fees we will reimburse you up to US$200.00 per person. Please submit supporting documentation to airreimbursements@carnival.com.

In the event you have any questions our team will be in the Victoriana Lounge Deck 3 forward from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM to assist with any inquiries. Additionally please visit us during this time if you have any health conditions that may be impacted by our extended return.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY2Fybml2YWwtcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLXN0cnVnZ2xpbmctdG8taGlyZS1jcmV3LW1lbWJlcnMtMjAyMi010gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9jYXJuaXZhbC1yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tc3RydWdnbGluZy10by1oaXJlLWNyZXctbWVtYmVycy0yMDIyLTU_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Royal Caribbean struggling to hire crew members,"Photo by Dylan McCord/U.S. Navy via Getty Images

Cruise companies have been struggling to hire back crew members.

Carnival has temporarily closed two restaurants on all of its ships.

Norwegian and Cunard have capped cruise ship capacities and canceled sailings.

The cruise industry could be in rocky waters again: Difficulties with hiring crew members has hindered several cruise lines' operations leaving some would-be cruise-goers with fewer onboard dining options or canceled trips.

Like on-land hospitality companies cruise lines haven't been immune to worker shortages"" amid the Great Resignation. And now a lack of available cruise workers has begun affecting itineraries and onboard amenities.

This staffing problem is one of the reasons Holland America has decided to ""pace its restart over the year"" a spokesperson told Insider in a statement. While Royal Caribbean's spokesperson acknowledged similar difficulties in hiring up the cruise line doesn't expect it'll be canceling any future itineraries.

Not all cruise companies have been as fortunate as Holland America or Royal Caribbean.

Guests sailing with Carnival will also be spared from itinerary changes. But this doesn't mean it'll be smooth sailing for the cruise line. Carnival will temporarily close two restaurants across all of its ships Fran Golden reported for Bloomberg.

""Our rapid restart has required us to bring back thousands of crew members in a very short time which has increased the number of resources needed for government officials to process the large number of visa applications and slowed down our ability to fully staff some of our functions including our culinary team"" a Carnival spokesperson told Insider in a statement.

Similarly Norwegian Cruise Line's Pride of America which typically operates with over 900 crew members is now accommodating under 550 workers Claudette Covey reported for Travel Pulse. As a result the cruise line has cut the ship's guest capacity as it sails in Hawaii. And some unluckier guests traveling on overbooked ships will have to be rebooked on different itineraries a spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Line told Insider.

Like Norwegian Cunard has limited the number of guests and canceled sailings aboard its Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria ships blaming the ""wider impact of COVID-19"" on its difficulties with hiring. There may not be an immediate relief in sight but a Cunard spokesperson has told Insider that these ""necessary"" cancellations and capacity issues will be ""short term.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53bHR4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvcmVnaW9uYWwvY3J1aXNlLXNoaXBzLW5vLWxvbmdlci1kZXBhcnQtY2hhcmxlc3Rvbi0yMDI0LzEwMS1hYjgxNjQyZS0zM2Y0LTQwMmUtOTM0MS03MDgzYmEyYzA5ODfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Carolina Ports Authority not renewing Carnival Cruise deal,"Cruise ships can continue to dock at Charleston but only for brief same-day port of call stops.

CHARLESTON S.C. — Cruise ships will no longer start their journeys from Charleston by the end of 2024 the South Carolina Ports Authority said.

The authority decided to not renew a deal with Carnival Cruise Line that allowed cruises to begin and end from the Union Pier Terminal in downtown Charleston.

Cruise ships can continue to dock at Charleston but only for brief same-day port of call stops The Post and Courier of Charleston reported.

The decision should cut the number of cruise passengers in Charleston down by 80% officials said.

The State Ports Authority said it will no longer work on plans to redevelop a warehouse at the Union Pier into a cruise terminal. Permits to start the project have been tied up for years by lawsuits from conservation and historical preservation groups.

Instead the authority said it will look into selling the land it owns to a private developer.

Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said the decision by the authority will improve the quality of life in his city.

“We’re grateful to the port for taking this critically important step and we look forward to continuing to work with (State Ports Authority) to make Union Pier a beautiful and vibrant part of the city of Charleston” Tecklenburg said.

Currently about 70 cruises a year leave Charleston for the Bahamas and other Eastern Caribbean destinations.

Carnival Cruise Line officials said they will continue to work with the authority to find options to use Charleston.

“In the meantime it is business as usual and we look forward to seeing our guests aboard Carnival Sunshine through 2024"" Carnival spokesman Matt Lupoli said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vc2Fwb3J0YXJlcG9ydC5jb20vYXRsYW50YS1jYXJpYmJlYW4tY2Fybml2YWwtcGFyYWRlLW9sZC1mb3VydGgtd2FyZC1tYXktMjgtMjAyMi9jb2x1bW5pc3RzL2tlbGx5am9yZGFuL2tlbGx5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlanta Caribbean Carnival Parade - Old Fourth Ward - May 28 2022 - SaportaReport,Kelly Jordan who has lived in Atlanta since 1968 attended Emory University before he and partners revitalized Little Five Points into one of Atlanta's most eclectic retail districts.

The US Navy reportedly conducted dual aircraft carrier exercises on Saturday and Sunday to the southeast of Okinawa not far from the location where the Liaoning aircraft carrier group of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy just wrapped up its three-week-long drills.Likely one of the main maritime battlefields if the US militarily intervenes in a possible conflict across the Taiwan Straits this region is of strategic significance and the US drills that closely followed the PLA exercises obviously aimed to provocatively lend support to secessionists on the island of Taiwan said analysts.The Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and the Ronald Reagan carrier strike group of the US Navy sailed to waters southeast of Okinawa and carried out dual aircraft carrier exercises from Saturday to Sunday the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) a Beijing-based think tank said on Sunday citing open flight tracking signals and remote-sensing imagery.While the US 7th Fleet announced the dual carrier drills on its Twitter account on Sunday it had not revealed the location as of press time. But since a commercial satellite image caught one of the carriers in the region on Sunday it is confirmed that the US drills are being held in the southeast of Okinawa the SCSPI said.The US dual carrier drills came after the PLA Navy's Liaoning aircraft carrier group returned to the East China Sea via the Miyako Strait from its far sea training in the West Pacific on May 21. According to Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff the Chinese carrier group entered the West Pacific on May 1 and carried out what observers said was the longest and most sortie-intensive exercise south of Okinawa and east of the island of Taiwan.That both China and the US sent aircraft carriers for drills in the same region indicates the high strategic value of this region and it could become a main maritime battlefield between the two countries should the US intervene militarily in a possible reunification-by-force operation on the island of Taiwan by the PLA a Beijing-based defense analyst who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday.By sending two super carriers to the region right after the Chinese carrier drills the US is attempting to console and lend support to ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces and Japanese military expansionists which sends a very wrong signal and could make the regional situation worse the above-quoted analyst said.The PLA must have monitored the whole situation thanks to its complex situational awareness system which is much more powerful and precise than commercial and open data the analyst said.On China's doorstep even the US cannot rival the PLA when it comes to China's core interests experts said noting that the PLA's ""carrier killers"" including anti-ship ballistic missiles will join warplanes and vessels in denying external interference in the Taiwan question if it comes to that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMjAvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvdG9tLWNydWlzZS10b3AtZ3VuLW1hdmVyaWNrLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Cruise Aims to Fly High at the Box Office With ‘Top Gun: Maverick’,"The helicopter had the star’s name painted on it the letters coming into focus as it landed on the retired aircraft carrier which was adorned for the occasion with an expansive red carpet and a smattering of fighter jets.

This week: The Women in Trucking Association honors influential women; ANL aims to rehabilitate the Australian turtle population; and C.H. Robinson recognizes its top-quality carriers.

The nonprofit organization Women in Trucking Association announced that Lily Ley vice president and chief information officer at Paccar was presented the 2021 Influential Woman in Trucking award.

The award was created in 2010 to recognize women in trucking who have helped bring other females into the industry and helped advance them in their careers.

Ley who grew up in a two-room home in Mexico with her parents and four siblings moved to the United States after graduating from CETYS Universidad and working as a programmer and system developer for Kenworth Mexicana.

Once in the U.S. she worked her way through a number of Paccar technology positions to become chief information officer and the first woman to be a part of the executive operating committee at the truck manufacturing company.

Ley also has overcome personal obstacles. In 2011 she climbed the highest mountain in Africa Mount Kilimanjaro because she wanted to conquer her fear of heights. And Ley has survived brain cancer — twice.

“What I learned early in life gave me the ability to go beyond every challenge. It gave me a foundation of fundamentals for what I do today. I see everything from different perspectives and I’m able to adjust to special circumstances. … Sometimes you just need to pause when it’s needed. Take a moment reflect on your purpose” Ley said.

Two other women in transportation were nominated and given finalist awards.





Eileen Dabrowski director of learning development and marketing at ReedTMS Logistics was nominated for her philanthropy initiatives mentorship programs and continued advocacy for diversity and inclusion within the industry.

Dabrowski is also a cancer survivor and believes that a balance of self-care and career can help you get the most out of life.

“Challenges and barriers don’t phase me. When things implode around me I keep it together and just figure things out” she said.

Finalist Amanda Schuier is the director of employee engagement at Jetco Delivery.

“My grandfather owned a Mack truck dealership and I was around trucks growing up. But never did I think as a child ‘I want to go into trucking’” said Schuier.

But after being laid off from a marketing firm she took a marketing job at a Paccar dealership. Schuier has since taken on roles in sales dispatching driver relations and safety and she advises women to never stop learning.

“Ask questions. Ask for help. Find mentors and pursue your passions. Remember that there are so many women out there who have been through what you’ve been through — so never feel timid to bounce ideas off others” said Schuier.

ANL launches Turtle Preservation Project

CMA CGM subsidiary Australian National Lines (ANL) on Monday launched its Turtle Preservation Project in partnership with Cairns Turtle Rehabilitation Centre (CTRC) to help rehabilitate and release sea turtles while educating people on the impacts of ocean plastics on their natural habitat.





Unfortunately since plastic has been mass produced in the 1940s 52% of the world’s turtles have eaten plastic waste according to the CTRC. Only one piece of plastic can lead to blockages ruptured organs inability to dive and feed often leading to death.

“The ocean is where we work and thus we have immense respect for it and the life it supports. The Turtle Preservation Project provides an opportunity to give back raise awareness for a challenge in Oceania while supporting a worthy cause aligned with our values. We look forward to seeing the preservation of sea turtles well into the future” said Shane Walden managing director of ANL.

A core piece of the partnership between ANL and CTRC is to help update the rehabilitation center’s tank and pump which will allow for better care of rescued turtles.

“We’re dedicated to the rehabilitation of sick and injured turtles. To do this important work we rely on contributions from many supporters and volunteers. We’re so glad to see ANL and the CMA CGM Group join our team” said Jennie Gilbert co-founder of CTRC.

'It's the most exciting fulfilling journey and I'm so grateful that it turned out like this' she told FEMAIL.

Sally who had worked in big city law firms the public sector and smaller high street firms said she realised she wanted more creativity in her day-to-day life.

Growing up her family were artistic and she spent her childhood exploring paper crafts embroidery and cake decorating with her mum and grandmother. Sally first discovered cross stitch when she was only eight years old.

Following the birth of her daughter Felicity now eight Sally realised it was the perfect opportunity to pursue a new passion.

While decorating the nursery she realised the cross-stitch market was old-fashioned and used stereotypical colours such as pink and blue and typical patterns such as teddy bears and animals.

She wanted to make her daughter's room cool and minimalist and saw a gap in the market to make cross-stitching more modern.

Strength to strength: In her first year Sally made just £600. But now seven years later Sally has a large warehouse a team of six employees is stocked in National Trust shops and has turned over £800000 in the last 12 months. Pictured in her office

Other companies were using obvious colour palettes but Sally wanted to think outside the box for example by suggesting hot pink and blue for a Halloween range.

'I thought to myself ""now's the time!"" It was one of those lightbulb moments where it ticked every box because it was something I was so passionate about' she said.

'I've never wanted to go back or regret it at all. I think you know in your heart when you've made the right decision.'

While her newborn daughter napped in the afternoon Sally studied an e-commerce course. She also had a fashion course and a photography course under her belt and drew on all of this experience in launching her company.

She bought a camera and initial supplies with £2000 of savings from her law career.

Modern take on a traditional hobby: A Caterpillar Cross Stitch patterns filled with detail

When business grew the kids moved into the same room and Sally moved into her son's old room to make space for new stock.

It has gone from strength to strength and Caterpillar Cross Stitch is forecast to turn over £1million in 2023. She has hit over 35000 followers on Instagram and over 23000 subscribers on YouTube.

The entrepreneur hopes that Caterpillar Cross Stitch will one day become the leading global brand for cross stitching.

But launching her own business has also come with challenges as the entrepreneur has needed to balance her career ambitions with being a mum to Felicity and Hugo and a wife to husband Tim.

Sally said she never had a moment where she wasn't working as she was running a business while homeschooling two small children.

She said: 'There's been a lot of sacrifice and I have to accept that I can't do everything. I'm not the perfect mother and I'm not the perfect CEO.

'It's been challenging on an emotional level too because I wanted to be at home all the time as a new mum.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL0NvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi9Lb21hdHN1LXJlc3VtZXMtc3VwcGxpZXMtb2YtbWluaW5nLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1wYXJ0cy1pbi1Va3JhaW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Komatsu resumes supplies of mining construction parts in Ukraine,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL0NvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi9Lb21hdHN1LXJlc3VtZXMtc3VwcGxpZXMtb2YtbWluaW5nLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1wYXJ0cy1pbi1Va3JhaW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533E264D90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL0NvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi9Lb21hdHN1LXJlc3VtZXMtc3VwcGxpZXMtb2YtbWluaW5nLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1wYXJ0cy1pbi1Va3JhaW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vYS16LWFuaW1hbHMuY29tL2FuaW1hbHMvY29kbGluZy1tb3RoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Codling Moth Insect Facts | Cydia pomonella,"View all of the Codling Moth images!

The codling moth is so pervasive that it is stereotypically called the “apple worm” leading to the common phrase “wormy apple”.

Codling moths are a major pest of apple and pear orchards. Caterpillars will bore into fruit which leads to premature ripening and inedible fruit. Without intervention codling moths can infest 20-90% of a fruit tree. In warmer conditions codling moths can have up to five generations in a season and caterpillars are able to enter a diapause state to survive poor fruiting seasons or cold winter temperatures.

Codling Moth Species Types and Scientific Name

There is only one species of codling moth. Its scientific name is Cydia pomonella. Pomonella is derived from Pomona the Roman goddess of fruit trees. The Genus name Cydia is familiar to iOS users as the popular application able to download software not authorized by Apple Inc. A metaphorical worm in Apple Inc’s products.

Appearance: How To Identify Codling Moths

Adult codling moths are rather nondescript with mottled grey wings held tentlike above their bodies. The mottling acts as camouflage allowing adults to blend with most tree bark. They average ½” to ¾” in size. Males will have a shiny copper band at the end of their wings.

Eggs are disc-shaped and roughly 1-1.2 mm. As the egg matures a red ring forms followed by a red dot where the caterpillar head is. When it hatches the caterpillar is about 2 mm long 0.5 mm in diameter and white with a dark brown head. As the caterpillar matures through five instars it will grow to 12-20 mm long and have a pinker appearance. A fully grown codling moth caterpillar will be light pink to light brown with dark brown spots along each segment and a dark brown or black head capsule.

Codling moth pupae are brown and 12mm long on average. First-generation caterpillars will spin a cocoon of finer silk while second-generation caterpillars will spin a coarser cocoon that incorporates wood bark.

Female codling moths will oviposit 30-70 eggs individually on the fruit nuts leaves or branches of the host fruit tree. While they’re capable of long-distance flight up to several kilometers a majority of adult codling moths remain sedentary. Adult moths are only active for a few hours before and after sunset. They prefer to mate during sunset when it is warmer than 62ºF.

Caterpillars are somewhat unique Lepidopteran juveniles in that they will bore into the flesh of fruits rather than feed on leaves. To survive the winter or years with poor fruit yield caterpillars are able to enter a state of decreased activity (diapause) and resume activity when temperature or food sources are more favorable.

Habitat: Where to Find Codling Moths

Codling moths are found everywhere apples are grown even on solitary trees in urban environments. Adults can be found on branches or the underside of leaves of the host tree while caterpillars will be found inside the flesh of the fruit.

After the fifth instar the codling moth caterpillar will drop from the fruit and search for a suitable place to pupate. Most will remain in the soil while some spin a cocoon in the crevices of the tree’s bark.

While codling moths are found on every continent it is believed they were native to Asia Minor and were introduced to Europe centuries before they were discovered. They were introduced to North America during the Colonial Period and expanded their habitat to the Pacific coast by 1872.

Diet: What do Codling Moths Eat?

What do Codling Moths Eat?

Juvenile codling moths are a voracious pest of apple orchards. If left unchecked they can damage anywhere from 20-90% of the fruit on a single tree. While apples are their preferred food codling moths are also a pest of pear walnut apricot peaches plums cherries and chestnuts. After emerging from the egg caterpillars will enter the fruit and tunnel to the center leaving a hole in the fruit filled with reddish-brown frass (poop). While there they will continue to eat and molt through five instars before dropping to the ground to spin a cocoon.

Adult codling moths rarely eat even though they are able to. Feeding does not affect the adult’s ability to mate and oviposit.

What eats Codling Moths?

Woodpeckers are the #1 predator of codling moth larvae and will feed as the caterpillars leave the fruit or when caterpillars are in their cocoons. Nuthatches and creepers are also significant predators of codling moth caterpillars.

A number of arthropods will prey on codling moths including spiders harvestman beetles earwigs and ants. Ants will attack all life stages while the other arthropods will generally prey on only the juvenile or adult stages.

Two species of thrip will prey on codling moth eggs. Haplothrips faurei are nondiscriminant and will prey on eggs from any generation while Leptothrips mali prefers second-generation eggs.

Prevention: How to Get Rid of Codling Moths

It is almost impossible to completely prevent a codling moth infestation. Instead growers should focus on monitoring to catch populations early on and implement control.

Pheromone traps placed during the pink stage of apple flower-bud development can be used to monitor for adult male codling moths. The process of banding trees has been used to monitor for caterpillars. A strip of cardboard is affixed to the trunk of the tree. The mature larvae will then spin their cocoons inside of the cardboard. Both pheromone traps and banding can be used to detect and then estimate the density of codling moth infestations.

Beginning as early as July growers should visually assess fruit for codling moth damage. Codling moth caterpillars prefer fruit in the top half of the tree so sampling of fruit in that area is most effective.

Treatment Thresholds: When to Control Codling Moths

There are two threshold-based methods one could use to determine when to implement control: damage to fruit and trap capture.

When visually inspecting fruit if fruit injury levels are greater than 0.5% of the total yield it is time to consider a control method for codling moths. Trap methods are a little more complicated but usually require less time and energy to monitor. Deploy one pheromone trap for every 2.5 acres and check traps once a week after the first moths are caught. Replace the trap after 30 moths have been caught or if the trap becomes dirty.

Thresholds for control using pheromone traps can be set in one of two ways. For the first method the threshold is set when two moths are caught in two consecutive weeks. The second method involves degree days which can be calculated here. If 5 or more moths are caught between 175 and 425 degree days then a control method should be implemented. Second-generation codling moth thresholds are reduced to 3 moths before a treatment plan is implemented starting on the 1175th-degree day.

Management: How to Control Codling Moths

There are several organic ways to control for codling moths before resorting to pesticides although most integrated pest management strategies recommend using them in conjunction with a conventional insecticide.

Choose resistant varieties such as early-maturing apples and pears and late-leafing walnuts.

Sanitation or the process of removing and destroying any fruit that shows signs of codling moth caterpillar damage. This should be done every 1-2 weeks roughly 6-8 weeks after the first bloom.

Bagging fruit is the best nonchemical option for small orchards. Young fruit is enclosed in a paper bag to prevent codling moth caterpillar from entering the fruit. Beginning 4-6 weeks after first bloom or when the fruit is ½” – 1” in diameter cut a 2” slit in the bottom of a standard paper lunch bag. Thin the fruit to one per cluster and slip the paper bag over the fruit creating a seal at the stem. Staple the bag shut.

Mating disruption involves applying a pheromone to crops that disrupts or delays the male codling moths’ ability to find and mate with females reducing the number of offspring for that generation.

Walnut and pear orchards can utilize the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma platneri in combination with mating disruption or pesticides. This small wasp oviposits in the codling moth egg and the wasp larvae feed on the undeveloped caterpillar. The wasp will then pupate inside the codling moth egg and emerge effectively killing the codling moth before any damage can be done.

Codling moth granulosis virus (CYD-X) is a biological insecticide that does not affect other arthropods humans pets or wildlife. After ingesting the virus codling moth caterpillars die of the disease in 3-7 days. CYD-X is as effective as conventional insecticides when applied weekly.

Spinosad is a biocontrol product derived from the bacteria Saccharopolyspora spinosa. While safe for people pets and the environment it is slightly toxic to beneficial insects.

Carbaryl is a broad-spectrum insecticide that is effective against codling moths but with significant disadvantages. It is toxic to natural predators and honey bees so should not be applied when fruit trees are in bloom. Spraying within one month of bloom may cause fruit to drop. More than one application of carbaryl may also cause an outbreak of pest mites.

Carbaryl has been linked to water quality problems. Nonchemical pest management strategies should be considered before the use of this insecticide.

The unnamed mainland national has exercised an option to purchase a four-bedroom apartment in The Nassim condominium complex from Cityneon group CEO Ron Tan setting the highest price recorded so far in the entire residential development at S$4915.21 per square foot.

“An opportunity like this is hard to come by considering that there are so few four-bedroom units above 4000 square feet available in the market for sale and in a move-in condition” said Tricia Ang the agency’s vice president for residential services in Singapore. “The owner has spent a great amount of time and effort to make the apartment even more unique ensuring each living space is complemented with an appropriate statement piece.”

CBRE’s research head for Southeast Asia Tricia Song expects luxury homes prices to continue rising this year due to strong demand limited supply and rising renovation costs even with cooling measures in place.

Price Markdown

The apartment in The Nassim — a low-rise residential block at 18 Nassim Hill developed by CapitaLand — has a total gross floor area of 4069 square feet (378 square metres) to account for one of the 55 units in the entire freehold development.

Tan whose company transformed from an events firm into a global intellectual property specialist has done major improvements as part of his exit plan for the unit. Renovations include placement of several statement pieces a whisky bar and a customised wine storage display cabinet among otters.

The seller bought his unit in February 2018 from Kheng Leong Company a private real estate firm belonging to the family of UOL and UOB tycoon Wee Cho Yaw for an undisclosed sum based on an account by EdgeProp.

After completing renovations Tan put the apartment on the market in February for S$22.5 million or S$5530 per square foot with the transaction representing an 11 percent markdown from that original asking price.

Song said the deal broke the previous record in the same condo development when a smaller condo spanning 3122 square feet changed hands for S$4165 per square foot last October.

The Chinese buyer will be joining other ultra-wealthy individuals on Nassim Road including the wife of the founder of Nanofilm Technologies International who paid S$128.8 million for a 32159 square foot good class bungalow last year as well as Stephen Riady executive chairman of SGX-listed builder OUE Group who bought his mansion in August 2019 for S$95 million.

The Nassim condo development has eight blocks of low-rise premium condos completed in late 2015 by Singaporean builder CapitaLand with Kheng Leong having purchased 45 units in 2017. The complex is a few minutes’ walk from the Tanglin lifestyle hub and a 15-minute drive to the Orchard Road shopping belt.

CBRE declined to disclose the buyer’s identity.

Prices Up for Luxury Homes

CBRE’s Ang said the increased additional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD) imposed in December has not had a material impact on the luxury residential market as transactions worth at least S$10 million have barely dipped this year.

She said there were 15 luxury homes that transacted in the first four months of the year nearly unchanged from the 16 properties that changed hands in the same period last year.

“The pandemic has also driven demand for such large homes as more people work from home and may also require additional space for their children to attend home-based learning” Ang said. “Notably even with the hike in ABSD Singapore luxury property remains attractive to foreigners.”

Data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority shows that sales of new private homes in Singapore’s core central region — where most premium and luxury homes are located — increased for the second straight month in April with 206 units sold up 35 percent from March.

“Now that Singapore has reopened its borders we have noticed viewing activity picking up and see greater demand for such luxurious residential properties from foreign investors” Ang said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcmFrYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tL2VuX1VTL211bHRpLW1vZGFsLWxvZ2lzdGljcy1wYXJrLWluLXNpbGNoYXItY2JyZS1zb3V0aC1hc2lhLWhhcy1iZWVuLWFwcG9pbnRlZC1hcy10aGUtYWR2aXNvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multi Modal Logistics Park in Silchar: CBRE South Asia has been appointed as the advisor,"Silchar had been included in the list of cities where Government of India is setting up Multi Modal Logistics Park (MMLP).

Earlier Government of India had declared a list of 35 cities for the MMLP project and Assam’s Jogighopa was the first place where new MMLP project was inaugurated. GOI is constructing these MMLPs under Bharatmala Pariyojana Programme.

In its latest extension of the project Silchar is being chosen as a site for MMLP along with four other cities like Mumbai Chennai Coimbatore and Hyderabad.

CBRE South Asia has been appointed as the advisor to the development of MMLP across these five cities.

CBRE Group Inc. is an American commercial real estate services and investment firm. The abbreviation CBRE stands for Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis. It is the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm. CBRE South Asia is now appointed as an advisory to National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and National Highways Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) in building up the MMLP in Silchar and other cities.

In July 2021 the ministry of Road Transport and Highways had informed that they directed NHIDCL for a detailed project report on MMLP in Cachar in 45.3 Acres of land. NHIDCL had engaged Tata Consulting Engineering and CBRE South Asia for the task.

Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) is an initiative of the Government of India steered by National Highways Logistics Management Limited under Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to develop and improve country’s freight logistics sector by lowering overall freight costs and time cutting warehousing costs reducing vehicular pollution and congestion improving the tracking and traceability of consignments through infrastructural procedural and information technology interventions.

“Keeping up with India’s rapid economic growth is the expansion of the country’s logistics sector. Our expertise and market espionage has embodied us to provide advice to the government of India on the development of Multi-modal Logistics Parks. The aim is to advace connectivity in the country to boost the national economy and especially exports” Anshuman Magazine the Chairman & CEO of CBRE India said.

“We are also assessing pre-feasibility for the development across a tranche of additional locations identified by MoRTH” said Preetham Mehra the Senior Executive of CBRE India.

MMLP can reduce the logistics cost by effective margins and it is functional in many developed countries also this is also going to create large number of employment opportunities believes the government.

With the MMLP project Silchar is going to have Warehouse Railway siding Cold Storage Custom Clearance house Yard Facility Workshops Petrol pumps truck parking administrative buildings boarding lodging eating joints and water treatment plants. But surface connectivity and communication of Cachar and Barak Valley along with Tripura and Mizoram is extremely vulnerable to drastic weather conditions. Flooding water logging landslides often isolates the entire geographical area from rest of the India. the work of Mahasadak is yet to be completed at such juncture the plan of MMLP seems like a mirage.",,,,,,

Scottie Scheffler the world's No. 1 player and resident of the Dallas area has a two-stroke lead heading into the final round.

Even though the tournament is being played in his back yard the four-time winner on the PGA Tour this season has failed to record a top-50 finish at the Charles Schwab Challenge. The same cannot be said for his fellow Texas Longhorn Jordan Spieth however as the 28-year-old has consistently played a role in this tournament since coming onto the PGA Tour. In nine appearances Spieth possesses not only a victory in 2016 but three runner-up results and four additional top-15 finishes. The world No. 9 will attempt to add to his stellar résumé as will his good friend and newly acclaimed two-time PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas.

Unlike most weeks on the PGA Tour the Charles Schwab Challenge presents relatively difficult scoring conditions to players. With a loaded field and a winning score settling somewhere in the mid-teens under par one of the best tournaments of the year could potentially unfold this week.

His first-place check was good for $1512000 bringing his season total to $6145981 which moved him to third on the PGA Tour’s 2021-22 season money list.

Burns started the final round seven strokes back but tied for low round of the day. He also tied Nick Price who in 1994 set the mark for the largest final-round comeback by a winner in tournament history.

Burns beat good friend Scottie Scheffler in a playoff but Scheffler still walked away with $915600 which brings his season total to $11215187.

Brendon Todd’s solo third was good for $579600.

Seven holes later the 31-year-old finished back in a tie for 27th with Varner shooting 10-over-par for his back nine.

Not only was it a costly mistake regarding FedEx Cup and World Ranking points but also tournament prize money with the American losing out on a potential $1.5 million paycheque and instead settling for a $56000 one instead.

It was a heart-breaking way to end the tournament for Varner who was spotted signing autographs with his fans despite his capitulation around Colonial Country Club.

The stuff you don’t see but says all you need to know about @HV3_Golf pic.twitter.com/1WsgFa1CO7May 29 2022

Producing three birdies and one bogey over the front nine Varner was well in contention going into the back. However as he came to the 12th the American was left with a lengthy wait as his playing partner Scott Stallings received a ruling on one of his shots.

After splashing out from the bunker Varner was faced with a 12-foot putt for par that would have kept him in a share of the lead. What followed was a four putt triple bogey that the 31-year-old never recovered from.

Following the triple Varner found the water on the 13th as he racked up a double bogey with yet another triple bogey being followed on the 14th as he moved to two-under-par for the tournament.

A birdie at the 15th seemed to be just a consolation as Varner finished double bogey-bogey for a 10-over-par back nine and a level-par tournament total something that just an hour or so earlier no-one would have even dreamed of!

Sunday at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth boasted a crowded leaderboard as the final nine got underway. That’s when the gusty winds started to take their toll on the field. Davis Riley hit a drive out of bounds on the 14th and made double bogey followed by Brendon Todd bogeying the par-5 11th. Scott Stallings was next to falter making bogey after airmailing the green at 12 closely followed by Harold Varner III coming up short from 124 yards plugging in the bunker and making a mess with a four-putt for a triple bogey. That put Scheffler in the lead alone before he bogeyed the 11th with a three-jack from the fringe which suddenly made Burns a very viable contender as he finished his round.

The USW called for an immediate end to the two-month-long struggle by 500 refinery workers.

The USW actions are a warning to the working class all over the United States and the world: the trade unions are agents of management and they aim to betray. The struggle at Richmond is a case in point: Workers in Richmond voted down a tentative agreement presented to them by the USW twice before going on strike two months ago. But now workers have been given a contract that is even worse than the one they rejected before.

For months workers have been on strike to avoid a cut in real wages (after inflation) to fight for an end to chronic understaffing and hated work schedules to ensure safety at the dangerous plant and to combat rising costs in their health care plan. Chevron workers speak for all workers across the globe who are refusing to bear the cost of inflation expressed in the dramatic rise in the cost of food fuel rent and other necessities.

The deal put forward by the USW on Saturday is the same contract as the one the company offered before the strike but the signing bonus has been reduced by $1000.

John a striking worker told the WSWS that the tentative agreement was a “slap in the face.” He said the union had snuck in several new clauses that “are essentially carte blanche for the company firing the workers.” Chevron will make workers return to work in a staggered manner he said over one-and-a-half months for each crew.

During this time the company will hold “return to site orientation” which sounds like captive audience meetings. This is to instill the zero-tolerance policy for harassment or discrimination against employees (mainly those who crossed).

The company has written that they have the ability to hire the strikebreakers at an Operator level of pay. This usually is a three-year training process but they want to treat the strikebreakers as equals.

Additionally the company has the right to assign non-represented employees to do bargaining unit work until the end of September.

Finally the union is required to withdraw all Unfair Labor Practice Violations against Chevron during the time of the strike. As well as refrain from filing anything new regarding that time frame. The company will get away with all their malpractice without recourse according to the agreement.

The TA is a decisive win for Chevron and an unqualified blow to the aspirations of these workers for better conditions.

The blame for this defeat lies squarely with the United Steelworkers union. The USW has exposed itself as an organization of scabs dedicated to isolating and sabotaging the real interests of rank-and-file workers.

First it should be noted that the contract reportedly passed by only “a slim majority” according to a claim USW Local 5 official B.K. White made to NPR local affiliate KQED. No faith should be placed however in this claim. At factories and workplaces across the country the USW United Auto Workers Teamsters and other major unions have been accused of ballot stuffing in order to ram through concessionary contracts against workers.

The USW has called off the strike declaring the contract ratified but the USW has not even released the vote count. They are fearful that releasing the results would show that a “majority” of striking workers did not support the contract. By stopping the strike without releasing any totals the USW is trying to halt any potential discussion criticism or protest about this betrayal.

According to eyewitness reports from workers who spoke to WSWS reporters few workers showed up to vote. In reality only a minority of the workforce actually voted to end the strike.

In its short five-sentence-long notification to its membership ending the two-month strike the USW fraudulently declared there was an “incredible turnout” and told workers they should be proud “regardless of the outcome” that is even though it was a total sellout.

This anti-democratic vote proceeding is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the duplicitous role the USW has played in this struggle.

There are over 30000 oil refinery and petrochemical workers in the USW who are covered by the national oil bargaining agreement the union renegotiated earlier this year.

On February 22 USW President Tom Conway met with Biden in a closed-door meeting aimed at ensuring that no national oil strike would occur. The Biden administration was worried that amidst the soaring cost of living the growing struggle of the working class and critically its own desire to commit to an escalation towards war against Russia strikes by oil workers could explode into focal points of popular opposition to war living costs and general social conditions.

Just three days later Conway announced the USW had come to an agreement with the oil companies. Conway even bragged—to the political and financial press—that he had signed a “responsible contract” that would “not add to inflationary pressures.” In short Conway was saying “We’re not responsible for inflation because our contract is bad for the workers.”

Following the “agreement” between the USW the Biden administration and the oil companies the USW exerted pressure on locals throughout the country to accept the contract.

At many plants for example at the Billings Montana Philips 66 refinery workers voted down the contract only to have USW executives flown out to browbeat them into accepting it. As one worker at that plant told the WSWS “I consider the national package a complete joke… These companies make billions and inflation is hacking away at true income. A raise that’s anything less than what inflation [is] does not constitute a raise.”

At Chevron workers voted down the deal presented to them by the USW twice.

Once they went on strike the USW provided no strike pay. This has been a punishing two-month experience for workers with no paychecks. Meanwhile the USW has over $168 million in cash on hand.

During the strike Chevron even announced it had quadrupled its quarterly profits from the year prior—a testament to how it was cashing in on the very inflation workers were fighting against.

Throughout all this the USW has completely isolated the striking workers. A refinery worker in Texas told the WSWS that basically no one even knew about the struggle a refrain repeated online when a WSWS article went viral on Imgur with 100000 views. The top comments were all USW members saying they had not heard about the Chevron struggle with one worker noting how “fishy” that was.

John told the WSWS about the mood among workers at Richmond. “The consensus” he said “is that it’s a sellout. No one cares for the agreement.”

Any genuine fight against the oil companies must strive to unite oil workers across the country in a combined effort to oppose the concessionary national pattern bargaining agreement and fight for a real improvement of working conditions. But to do this would require a struggle against the USW itself.

It is for this reason that we urge workers to get involved with the Oil Workers Rank-and-File Committee.

The struggle at Chevron and the struggle in the oil and gas industry as a whole is not over. Rather it has just begun.

In just two weeks dockworkers across the West Coast may go on strike. In auto trucking health care and across the entire working class the grievances experienced by Chevron workers are broadly felt. They want to fight declining real wages as work becomes harder and harder with more and more punishing work schedules.

Various pseudo-left organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) do the dirty work for the pro-capitalist unions. Typical was the response of Richmond City Councilperson Claudia Jimenez a DSA member who praised the USW sellout. “I’m glad that the workers got a contract. However it should not have taken workers striking to get the benefits they were asking for” even though workers won none of their demands.

This experience shows that rank-and-file committees are needed to create a democratic organization run by workers themselves independent of the trade unions and the Democratic Party which seeks to unite different sections of struggling workers in a combined fight against the major corporations and their political lackeys.

The Chervon Group (not to be confused with the energy company Chevron) is the owner of Flex Power Tools.

Who Is The Chervon Group?

Chervon is a global manufacturer out of China and its North American operations are based in Naperville Illinois. While we don’t have an exact number internet sources suggest it employs roughly 200 people in North America.

Chervon’s vision statement is:

“Better Tools. Better World.”

Its mission statement is:

“Providing superior products to users worldwide through continuous innovation we are determined to become a global leader in power tools and outdoor power equipment in the lithium-ion intelligent and digital era.”

In 2021 Cervon reported more than $1.7 billion in revenue with a profit of just under $150 million. Both represent significant increases over the previous three years and a trend of increasing sales and profit.

Today Chervon owns several well-known tool brands in North America including Flex EGO and Skil/Skilsaw. They also manufacture power tools for other brands.

Based on our experience with each of these brands we find they offer excellent quality and typically outperform competitor products at the same price point.

Chervon’s History of Owning Flex Power Tools

Flex as a power tool brand has been around for far longer than the 24V professional-grade tools you can buy at Lowe’s and other select manufacturers.

Flex tools with the red color scheme are the same brand and have been well-known in the automotive industry in particular. It made its first appearance in 1922 in Germany—100 years ago as we’re writing this! Among its many innovations Flex developed the world’s first handheld grinder with a flexible shaft back in 1954.

In 2013 the Chervon group acquired Flex.

Over the past several years Chervon has used Flex’s reputation for high-quality engineering and manufacturing to expand it into a more far-reaching 24V cordless system targeting professional contractors across multiple trades.

Just in the past two years we’ve seen Flex redefine the limits of core tools such as the hammer drill. We’ve seen the development of Stacked Lithium pouch cell batteries in higher capacity batteries than anyone has. With each new launch we consistently see technology innovation and design that attacks specific pain points or limits contractors find with other tools.

Ree Drummond makes spicy shrimp for a surf and turf platter

Drummond demonstrated how to make her chipotle glazed shrimp recipe during an episode of The Pioneer Woman where she grilled an entire meal.

“I’m going to do carne asada and glazed shrimp” she said. “You’ve got to love surf and turf. It’s great in any form.”

Drummond started by soaking skewers in water so they didn’t burn during grilling and threaded the shrimp on each stick. “When I thread shrimp on a skewer I always start with the fat end and then thread it through — and you want it to go through the other end” she explained. “And that way when the shrimp grill they stay neatly on the skewer.”

The Food Network star joked that she learned the method by trial and error. “I think I’m going to write a cookbook sometime and the title is going to be ‘Trial and Error'” she joked. “It’s the story of my life.”

‘The Pioneer Woman’ star’s grilled shrimp has a sweet and spicy glaze

For the “sweet and sticky and spicy” glaze Drummond whisked together lime zest green onions honey olive oil and adobo sauce from a can of chipotle peppers. “It really packs a punch — not just with spice but also with flavor” she said. “I never ever get tired of adobo sauce.”

Drummond added “You see some repeating from the carne asada marinade to the shrimp glaze. Everything’s kind of beautifully connected. It all goes together.”

She preheated a grill brushed the shrimp with glaze and grilled it for 2 minutes per side brushing with glaze again and removing the skewers after the shrimp were fully cooked.

Drummond paired the shrimp with carne asada

During the episode Drummond also made an easy carne asada for her surf and turf platter.

“I am making carne asada which is a fantastic Mexican dish to make on the grill” she explained. “I’m making a marinade because the carne asada is going to be with skirt steak and that is always better if you let it marinate for a bit.”

She added orange juice lime juice serrano pepper garlic cloves Mexican oregano cilantro olive oil honey salt and pepper in a blender. She combined the marinade with the skirt steaks in a resealable bag then marinated the meat for at least an hour.

The Food Network host preheated the grill and sprinkled salt and pepper on the steak then grilled it for 4 minutes per side. Once the meat finished cooking she placed it on a cutting board and allowed it to rest for 5 to 7 minutes before she sliced it against the grain.

The full recipe is available on the Food Network website.",,,,,,

SÃO PAULO Brazil – As candidates make their final efforts for support for the May 19 general elections in the Dominican Republic the Church suddenly appeared as an influence for voters.

Earlier this week the Bishops’ Conference’s Pastoral Ministry for Life released a list of candidates it’s endorsing for Congress.

Father Manuel Ruiz a long-time pro-life activist in the Caribbean nation is the mastermind behind the initiative which has been criticized by the press.

“We think that the people needed our guidance. Candidates say beautiful words during their campaigns but we wanted to show to the people what they have done in the past and what were their commitments” Ruiz told Crux.

The commission followed the candidate’s lives for months paying attention to their statements the ideas they have been expressing and their actions in Congress in the cases of lawmakers seeking re-election. The group focused on the stances of politicians regarding the so-called gender theory abortion and euthanasia.

“For one year we looked at them on the internet we followed their steps and we heard what they had to say” the priest explained.

The list includes 130 candidates from several parties on the left-wing and on the right-wing and with different ideologies. Ruiz said that “regardless of who will win the important thing is to have pro-life incumbents.”

“In some districts we almost couldn’t find a candidate to indicate so we chose the lesser evil – and then we will accompany that person after the elections” he added.

The list was sent to every parish in the country. The idea is that the pastor prints it and shows it to parishioners so they can know the suggestions.

“If the other candidates are sure about their [pro-abortion] policies they should send their platforms to us and we will gladly send them to the parishes as well. But they prefer to keep their ideas about such issues in secret” Ruiz said.

Abortion is completely forbidden in the Dominican Republic. Over the past years politicians and activists tried to advance bills concerning the introduction of more flexible legislation.

Their idea was to allow abortion under three circumstances: If pregnancy poses risks for the mother’s health if the unborn child has a condition that makes his or her life inviable out of the womb or if pregnancy was the result of rape.

Nobody has been able to introduce the three circumstances for legal abortion in the Dominican legislation but some of the current candidates defend the proposal and the subject has been creating division among voters.

“The debate on the three circumstances for legal abortion interrupted the process of approval of a new penal code. The current one is from the 19th century and is obsolete. So that’s a central issue for the country” sociologist Alejandro Abreu told Crux.

He said that surveys have shown that most Dominicans reject the decriminalization of abortion but a small majority favors that it may be legal in some cases.

That’s why Ruiz thinks that this is a moment in which the Church must openly declare its views and support the right candidates.

“Of course many argue that the Church must be prudent and keep out of politics. But Latin America has been giving worrisome signs and we should roll up our sleeves” the priest said.

Over the past years a number of Latin American countries legalized abortion like Colombia and Argentina and euthanasia like Ecuador. Ruiz said that the region is dominated by left-wing governments that have closed the doors to the Church and adopted policies imported from developed nations “which financed abortion and euthanasia all over the world.”

Ruiz said that the Pastoral Ministry for Life is not only concerned about subjects like abortion and gender ideology but also “defends the survival of everybody and is against policies that increase poverty for instance.”

“Catholics must balance all those things. Some politicians only favor developed nations trade agreements that harm Latin America mining projects that devastate our countries. A pastoral for life cannot preach the gospel for dead people” he said.

Abreu claimed that “the Church stance expressed through Father Ruiz comes from a traditionalist Catholicism.”

“The Church is not breaking any rule by declaring its preferences in the election. But assuming a belligerent attitude impacts the work of mediation that the Catholic hierarchy should carry out. One can’t rule from the extremes” Abreu said.

In his opinion “every time the Church directly intervened in electoral politics things didn’t end up well.”

“The Church in Latin America has historically taken sides with conservatives. But with Liberation Theology it also sided with the left-wing in some moments. One way or the other it always went wrong” he added.

Abreu said that themes like abortion and gender theory have been creating deep divisions and irrational stances on both sides and the Church should intervene by mediating the debate instead of taking one side.

“Mentioning specific candidates is something unprecedented for the Church in the Dominican Republic” he said.

Most Dominicans will probably not guide themselves by the Church’s electoral list Abreu added but it may impact one of the major races the one for the next national district’s senator.

The two front-runners are Guillermo Moreno and Omar Fernandez a young politician whose father former President Leonel Fernandez is trying to get a new presidential tenure.

Moreno has declared on a number of occasions that he’s not pro-abortion but that he favors the introduction of the three circumstances. Fernandez is pro-life and received the Church’s support.

“Moreno is now eight or seven points ahead according to polls. If the margin between them diminishes the Church’s endorsement to Fernandez may be determinant for the final result” Abreu said.

Ruiz said he’s not worried about the criticism he has been suffering from the press and nongovernmental organizations. He said most priests and bishops support him.

“We caused a revulsion. Many people thought the Church was in the ICU but they now see that it has a presence in the nation that no other institution has” he said.

The Gospel must dictate the norms of life in society Ruiz claimed.

“With that effort we were able to draw the people’s attention to what the Church has to say” the priest said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY3J1eG5vdy5jb20vdmF0aWNhbi8yMDI0LzA1L2NodXJjaC1zYW5jdGlvbnMtcHJpZXN0LWZvci1iZWluZy1hbi1vbmxpbmUtdHJvbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church sanctions priest for being an online troll,"Listen

ROME – This week a public spat on social media platform X previously known as Twitter revealed that a Spanish priest has been barred by the Vatican from his online activities for trolling a victim of a Peru-based group currently under investigation.

In a May 7 post on X Spanish Father Francisco Delgado who lives in Virginia Dale Colo. in the United States announced that “By direct order of my Archbishop I am forced to interrupt activity on all of my networks and suspend my participation in the media.”

A high-ranking source confirmed to Crux the archbishop received the request from the Holy See.

“This time I’m not doing it of my own free will. I have no choice but to defend myself against a slander that I hope one day to be able to give details about” he said insisting that despite the “persecution” against him “I continue to maintain my purpose of being faithful to the Church of Christ and to its visible leader who is Pope Francis.”

Delgado one of six priests who regularly appear on the popular “La Sacristía de La Vendée” podcast said he would be offering the suffering this situation has caused “for the conversion of those who harm the Church from outside and from within. Long live Christ the King!”

In a response post on X the same day a man named of José Enrique Escardó Steck also known as JEES said that “In the midst of so many stupid attacks by a pole there comes good news for me.”

Founder of the Peru Survivors Network and co-founder of the Brave Movement of Latin America and the Caribbean Escardó is a former member of the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae (SCV) and was the first to lodge a complaint against the group in 2000.

A lay group founded by Peruvian layman Luis Fernando Figari in the 1970s the SCV for 10 years has been shrouded by scandals involving various allegations of abuse and accusations of financial corruption against Figari and other top-ranking members.

Scandals erupted in 2015 when Peruvian journalists Pedro Salinas and Paola Ugaz authored a blockbuster book titled “Half Monks Half Soldiers” exposing scandals within the group.

Figari was accused of physical psychological and sexual abuse within the community including sexual abuse of minors and in 2017 was sanctioned by the Vatican and prohibited from having further contact with members of the group. He is currently living in exile in southern Italy.

Last summer Pope Francis sent his top abuse investigating team Maltese Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Spanish Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu to Lima to begin a formal inquiry into SCV and its various attempts at reform.

Escardó spoke with Scicluna and Bertomeu while the duo was in Lima conducting official interviews and inquiries.

In his May 7 post on X Escardó said Delgado several months ago had “blocked me and then defamed and insulted me” on the social media platform through “various tweets and for several days for being a victim of the #Sodalicio.”

“The story reached the Vatican and they asked me for details of the case because the investigation into the Sodalitium is still open” he said saying Vatican officials “told me they were going to sanction him.”

Several days later Escardó said he listened to Delgado’s podcast in which Delgado apparently said “he wished Pope Bergoglio was dead.”

“Well here are the consequences” Escardó said saying “For the first time in history the Catholic Church sanctions a priest for trolling and I feel proud that it was thanks to me.”

He also accused Delgado of covering up the abuse of a fellow priest in Spain saying “I hope this is just the first measure and that the same thing happens with others who act the same.”

In addition to Delgado Escardó said a similar sanction was also made against another priest “who insulted me” Father Juan Razo and that instead of making a public statement Razo “first deleted his tweets and then quietly closed his account.”

In comments to Crux Escardó said the online confrontation with Delgado began in January when he replied to a post that Rezo had made criticizing the image of a Jesus “who seemed a bit homosexual” on a poster in Seville during Holy Week.

Escardó said he sarcastically replied that he would like the priests to spend as much time talking about how to obtain justice and reparation for victims of sexual abuse in the Church saying Razo would one day have to face “this election of priorities” before God.

In response he said Razo replied with a quote from Proverbs saying “’Answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own eyes.’ You are so short-minded that you answer one thing with another. Don’t come and blame other people’s faults in my face. Only ignorant people use insults when they have no arguments.”

Things deteriorated from there Escardó said saying Razo continued to insult him and make vicious comments in his posts. Eventually Escardó revealed that he was a victim of abuse on the part of the SCV and that the posts were revictimizing.

He told Crux that each of the priests had thousands of followers so others joined and also began attacking him and that Delgado was among those who did so blocking him on X before opting “to tell lies about me to defame me to disparage the allegations against the Sodalicio” in several posts for the next three days.

Escardó gave Razo 24 hours to delete his posts threatening to send the exchanges to the Vatican. When Razo did not comply publishing more critical posts in response Escardó reached out to the Vatican and when asked sent the relevant correspondence.

As the situation online unfolded Escardó said he was contacted by someone claiming to be the victim of a priest in Spain and that Delgado had helped to cover up the abuse.

Delgado declined a Crux request for comment on the situation saying that by order of his archbishop he was unable to make any statements to the media.

Though he said he has little hope that any real justice will be achieved through the Vatican’s investigation Escardó said he remains firm in his desire to seek justice and reparation for victims of abuse in the church.

(KOLN) - If you are traveling in far northern Sioux County you might want to drive by the Montrose Church which is located on the Oglala National Grassland.

We caught up with Mary Jayne Jordan to talk about some of the memories she had of attending services at the Montrose Church while growing up.

“What I remember is no air conditioning” Jordan said. “I also remember in the summer time the windows were open and you would smell sage in the air. Whenever I smell sage I go right back to Montrose in my mind.”

The Montrose Church can be found on Hat Creek Road and Road 958 in Sioux County.

“The church was built in 1887” Jordan said. “The immigrants who came to that area were mostly all Catholic so they chose to build this church. They wanted to have a gathering place to worship.”

There was a former village named Montrose that was established there for a time. The village no longer exists.

“My dad and his sisters went to school across the road from the church” Jordan said.

Amazingly the structure that still stands today is the one that’s been there since the beginning. It’s never moved or been damaged. A local family now provides funding to keep the building looking good.

“At one point they built a rectory for the priest to stay in” Jordan said. “But again it’s so remote priests are in high demand so we always had a traveling priest. They eventually sold the rectory and it moved north of Ardmore. The church closed in 1973.”

We are told supporters of the church try to hold an honorary mass there once a year.

“My older brother and I were my sister’s godparents in 1968” Jordan said. “She and a cousin of ours were the last two children to be baptized here when it was an active parish in 1968. There have been weddings since then but it’s not been an active parish since 1973.”

Klik untuk follow WhatsApp Channel & Google News

Bicara soal cinta sering banget dikaitkan dengan romantisme hubungan antar dua sejoli. Seolah-olah satu-satunya yang berhak menyandang kata cinta itu adalah perasaan kita pada kekasih aja. Hal lain di luar itu dianggap bukanlah bentuk cinta.

Sementara ada banyak sumber cinta lain yang justru keberadaannya sering kita abaikan. Padahal tanpanya kita bukanlah apa-apa. Berikut lima sumber cinta selain romansa yang perlu kita pahami bersama. Sudahkah kamu bersyukur memiliki banyak cinta dari berbagai sumber ini?

1. Tuhan cintanya sungguh gak berbatas ilustrasi orang beribadah (pexels.com/PNW Production) Sang Pencipta adalah salah satu sumber di mana kita gak hanya bisa menemukan cinta ketika mendekatkan diri kepada-Nya tapi juga ketenangan dan kedamaian. Berbagai permasalahan hidup dari yang ringan hingga yang paling berat sekalipun bisa kita ceritakan kepada Tuhan tanpa perlu takut gak didengar atau bocor kemana-mana. Berbeda dengan dekat pada makhluk-Nya dekat dengan Tuhan gak akan membuat kita kecewa. Akan selalu ada bukti cinta-Nya yang bisa kita rasakan jika mau melihat lebih detail.

2. Sahabat kepedulian adalah cara mereka menunjukkan cintanya ilustrasi berkumpul dengan teman (pexels.com/Kampus Production) Gak cuma kekasih sahabat justru bisa menunjukkan kepedulian dengan cara yang sangat romantis bak drama Korea. Diam-diam mereka bisa begitu perhatian dan gak bertele-tele langsung melakukan tindakan nyata sebagai bentuk kasih sayangnya pada kita. Meskipun kebanyakan sahabat mungkin gengsi dan bilang bahwa mereka gak sepeduli itu sama kita nyatanya setiap tingkah lakunya justru berkata sebaliknya. Kita bahkan bisa merasakan kepeduliannya ini terutama di saat-saat paling menyedihkan dalam hidup.

4. Hewan peliharaan gemas dan bikin jatuh cinta ilustrasi hewan peliharaan (pexels.com/Zen Chung) Meski gak dimiliki semua orang namun mereka yang memiliki hewan peliharaan pasti tau banget rasanya mencintai dan dicintai oleh hewan lucu dan menggemaskan ini. Walaupun hanya hewan yang tampaknya gak memahami apapun nyatanya banyak orang yang berhasil dibikin jatuh cinta berkali-kali oleh hewan peliharaannya. Bahkan beberapa jenis hewan yang umum dipelihara seperti kucing dan anjing mampu mengenali perasaan tuannya dan menghibur mereka saat sedih. Ini yang bikin kebanyakan orang serasa gak bisa hidup tanpa hewan peliharaannya.

Sifat emosional yang dimiliki manusia akan menghasilkan dua dampak berbeda yaitu baik dan buruk. Hanya ada 8 karakteristik serta ekspresi dari sebuah emosi ini yang ternyata dibutuhkan dalam sebuah hubungan. Tujuannya untuk memperkuat ikatan tersebut.

Selain itu karakteristik atau bentuk ekspresi ini bisa memberi makna kehidupan dan menjadi alasan utama mengapa kita tetap bertahan bersamanya atau mengapa Anda masih ingin hidup sampai sekarang.

Mungkin kebutuhan orang atas sebuah hubungan sangat beragam tetapi 8 emosional ini jika dimiliki oleh Anda maupun pasangan ternyata bisa menjadi titik awal yang baik bagi kalian berdua seperti melansir dari Healthline Kamis (19/5/2022).

1. Kasih sayang

Sebagian besar hubungan melibatkan berbagai jenis ekspresi kasih sayang seperti:

- Sentuhan fisik

- Keintiman seksual

- Kata-kata cinta

- Sikap yang baik

Kasih sayang ini akan membantu Anda meningkatkan kedekatan atau ikatan dari hubungan tersebut. Adalah benar jika tidak semua orang menunjukkan kasih sayang dengan cara yang sama tetapi hal ini sudah menjadi tolak ukur bagi mayoritas pasangan lainnya.

Sebagai contoh saat pasangan Anda tidak menunjukkan kasih sayang dengan cara yang sama Anda mungkin mulai khawatir dan mempertanyakan ‘apakah dia mencintaiku?’.

Faktanya masalah pada sebuah hubungan biasanya di picu dari kurangnya kasih sayang entah itu dari tindakan atau vlisan. Jika hubungan Anda terlihat menghawatirkan seperti ini coba untuk melakukan pendekatan nonkonrontatif seperti menyatakan apa yang Anda rasa dan setelah itu memberitahukan apa yang Anda inginkan.

The report which was sponsored by Cisco and conducted by 451 Research surveyed 2500 IT decision-makers around the world. According to the report 82% of organizations have adopted hybrid cloud showing just how widespread the trend has become. Hybrid isn't just about on-premises workloads it's also about public cloud and 47% of respondents said they use two or three public cloud providers. Only 8% noted that they use a single public cloud.

There is also a lot of movement from on-premises to the cloud as well.

""Fifty-eight percent of the respondents are moving workloads between on- and off-premises environments weekly"" Todd Brannon senior director Cloud Platforms Marketing at Cisco told ITPro Today. ""This is a faster operational tempo than we expected and it demonstrates continuous optimization of workload placement is becoming more widely adopted.""

Challenges Revealed in 2022 Global Hybrid Cloud Trends Report

Related: How to Choose a Cloud Provider for Your Hybrid Cloud Solution

There is no shortage of challenges that organizations deal with when implementing a hybrid cloud strategy.

""There are different operating models and technology specializations with each of the public cloud vendors"" Brannon said. ""Therefore it’s easy for IT organizations to become more siloed.""

He added that the increased diversity and complexity of the hybrid cloud environment generates all manner of challenges that the report helped to identify. The survey asked respondents: ""What are the most significant challenges your organization faces or would face using multiple clouds?"" (Respondents were able to pick multiple answers so the total is more than 100%.)

Topping the list is security at 37% followed by operational complexity and managing costs which were tied at 33%. Twenty-five percent of users identified lack of visibility and control as an issue. And the skills shortage for managing hybrid cloud deployments was noted as a challenge by 20% of respondents.

Hybrid Cloud Headed Toward the Edge

A key trend identified in the report is the growing use of edge computing.

Bannon noted that 41% of survey respondents currently have some form of edge computing capability while an additional 53% expect to deploy edge computing in the next two years.

Also to deal with the growing complexity of hybrid cloud AIOps will increasingly be used by organizations. The report found that 45% are using some form of AIOps technology today and 49% are expecting to deploy it in the next year.

""We expect that trends around sovereign clouds the continuous introduction of new cloud services and growth of specialized and regional providers will continue to drive increases in the number of cloud services IT teams look to connect and operate with"" Bannon said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoZXJuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWF0dXJlL25ldC13b3J0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Net Worth | Features | Northern Express,"Net Worth

Using gill net surveys to study the health of Michigan’s fish populations

By Victor Skinner | May 28 2022

Pat O’Neill and Kris Snyder are cruising the Lake Michigan shoreline stopping overnight at a half-dozen popular fishing ports along the way.

They started out in St. Joseph but are surely to Arcadia by now more than halfway to their final stop in Charlevoix. From April through June the duo haul in thousands of fish of all kinds into their state-owned research vessel the Steelhead where they meticulously document the number length weight and other biological data. They also take specific samples from certain fish: stomachs bone structures and whatever else is requested from a handful of universities.

“We’re working for a lot of different people when we’re out here” says O’Neill a Michigan Department of Natural Resources employee and captain of the Steelhead. This year it’s Grand Valley State University Purdue University and Michigan State University.

The Science of Surveys

At a typical stop in South Haven in mid-May O’Neill and Snyder a DNR technician took in about 180 fish including 50 or so lake trout about the same number of whitefish dozens of perch walleye suckers gobies steelhead and several other species.

They set about 2000 feet of specially designed gill nets each day—at depths of 30 feet 50 feet 100 feet and 150 feet—then spend the night aboard the Steelhead before retrieving their catch the next day and repeating the process again further north. In 2021 researchers set more than 100000 feet of net and collected more than 5000 fish.

Since 1997 the Michigan DNR has collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Native American tribes to conduct the spring gill net surveys which provide the most comprehensive picture of the status of adult Lake Michigan fish populations.

Using a standardized process researchers from each agency survey different areas of the lake to assess recreationally commercially and ecologically important fish populations with a focus on lake trout burbot lake whitefish and yellow perch in Michigan waters. The information collected is used to inform ongoing research and management for multiple species.

“We can determine survival rates what kinds of food they’re eating [and the] age structure of the population” says Dave Clapp DNR research station manager in Charlevoix. “It all helps inform stocking decisions.”

The hard numbers collected on the water are difficult to come by and are not published publicly in a central location. Instead the data is fed into computer models to monitor trends in specific populations. The resulting reports are presented to and published by the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission (GLFC) a collaboration consisting of representatives from eight states the Province of Ontario and U.S. tribes that work together to manage the Great Lakes.

Creating the Big Picture

A lag time to process the information means the reports are typically based on data from a year or two prior but taken with a variety of other research like forage fish surveys bottom trawls creel surveys and acoustic telemetry work the reports help to paint a picture of how the lake is evolving and how the fish are evolving with it. The gill net data is also incorporated in reports to justify federal funding and to help inform recommended harvest objectives negotiated between the state and Native American tribes.

In the broadest sense the data shows Lake Michigan is diversifying moving from a waterbody dominated by chinook and Coho salmon to one that offers a more mixed bag. While “it really depends on the part of the lake you’re looking at” Clapp says there are clear trends emerging lakewide driven largely by invasive species like zebra and quagga mussels and round gobies.

Alewives a dominant forage fish have steadily declined in recent decades and so have the salmon that depend on them for survival. But that change has been a boon for the lake trout the state and federal government have worked hard to restore since they were nearly wiped out more than 50 years ago.

By the Numbers

After decades of stocking lake trout the fish are now naturally reproducing in different areas of Lake Michigan with rates of up to 50 percent wild fish in the southern basin and percentages of the same at a measurable 10 percent or more in the north end of the lake.

Researchers clip the adipose fin of all fish stocked in Lake Michigan and the presence of a growing number of unclipped lake trout in gill net surveys has prompted the DNR to eliminate lake trout stocking entirely in southern Lake Michigan and to more closely monitor their numbers further north.

“Now we’re actually starting to see more wild fish they’re starting to reproduce out there in the lake” Clapp says. “They’re on a bit of an upswing.”

Other species are cyclical and spotty.

Yellow perch for example don’t number what they once did in the 1980s and '90s though the population continues to lure anglers in both Lake Michigan and Grand Traverse Bay.



“Generally perch numbers are down a little bit but relatively stable” Clapp says.

Watching the Whitefish

The species of most concern for both the state and tribes in the region is whitefish which have dwindled as quagga mussels have slowly choked out spawning habitat.

“It’s just been a steady decline” says Jay Wesley DNR Lake Michigan basin coordinator and GLFC representative. “They’ve been on the decline for 10-15 years now and that seems to be tied pretty tight to quagga mussels and the effects they’ve had on the lake.”

Clapp says the situation is troublesome because “[whitefish] fuel a commercial fishery that fuels the restaurants up here.”

The DNR is currently working on tagging whitefish in Grand Traverse Bay to learn more about what’s driving the dynamic while the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians are also monitoring the situation at several sites in the bay: Lee Point Old Mission the Grand Traverse shoal and an East Bay reef north of Elk Rapids.

The tribe’s commercial whitefish harvest in the bay and northern Lake Michigan peaked in 1996 at 620000 pounds but in the last three years has averaged only 10451 pounds says Erik Olsen lead tribal biologist for the Great Lakes fisheries. Commercial whitefish harvest for all tribes was typically between 4-5 million pounds until 2012 but now averages around 1 million pounds Olsen says.

“It’s basically gone down 75 percent” he explains. “I know state [commercial anglers] fishing out of Leland haven’t reached their quota in quite a few years. This is an environmental shift not an overfishing shift.”

Quagga mussels have filled in spawning areas leaving eggs vulnerable while green algae blooms and the invasive rusty crayfish have also played into the dynamic. The algae “covers up a lot of those shoals [where whitefish spawn] and you have rusty crayfish going in there and eating eggs” Olsen says.

Perhaps the biggest issue for whitefish however is the loss of diporeia a small shrimp-like crustacean that have been filtered out by mussels. “They’re almost gone” Olsen says. “They were a high energy food whitefish could eat. Now you’re finding fish with crushed up mussels in some of their stomachs.”

Not-So-Red Herring

And while whitefish are struggling another native fish known as cisco or herring is growing in number in several places in Grand Traverse Bay according to Olsen.

“One thing we have seen is there’s a lot more herring in Grand Traverse Bay than there has been in my time” Olsen said. “In the last 10 years they’ve really popped up. You can now charter and go herring fishing out of Elk Rapids” he says.

The cisco charters are one of several ways the fishing industry is changing in northern Michigan says Mark Breederland Michigan Sea Grant educator for the region. For decades charter captains and most big lake recreational anglers targeted primarily salmon with little interest for anything else but perceptions of the perfect catch are shifting he says.

“My sense is there’s a lot broader acceptance to diversify the fishing opportunities” he says. “Most of the charter captains I run into … are an opportunistic business looking to match the fishery.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvTWF5LzI5L2N5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktY29tcGFuaWVzLWJyYWNlLWZvci1tb3JlLWN5YmVyLWF0dGFja3MtMjQ1OTE2Mi5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL01heS8yOS9jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LWNvbXBhbmllcy1icmFjZS1mb3ItbW9yZS1jeWJlci1hdHRhY2tzLTI0NTkxNjIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cybersecurity: Companies brace for more cyber attacks,BENGALURU: Many organisations irrespective of size transformed their operations to facilitate remote work during the pandemic period.

Not only were the Jaguars picking No. 1 overall for the first time in franchise history and set to land generational quarterback prospect Trevor Lawrence but the Jaguars also had four other picks in the top-65 and enough ammo on Day 3 to make an impact to all areas of the roster.

One year later though does it look like the Jaguars and general manager Trent Baalke navigated the waters well or does it instead look like the Jaguars had more swings and misses than base hits?

While draft grades immediately following a draft are relatively useless it is always worthwhile to take looks at how drafts play out down the road. The typical rule of thumb is to grade a draft after three years but you can also find value in grading drafts a year or two years after the picks are made.

In this case Pro Football Focus took a look at the 2021 draft class and gives out grades a year later comparing them to their initial grades. For references sake here is the Jaguars' crop from a year ago.

No. 1 Round 1: QB Trevor Lawrence

No. 25 Round 1: RB Travis Etienne

No. 33 Round 2: CB Tyson Campbell

No. 45 Round 2: OT Walker Little

No. 65 Round 3: S Andre Cisco

No. 106 Round 4: DL Jay Tufele

No. 121 Round 4: EDGE Jordan Smith

No. 145 Round 5: TE Luke Farrell

No. 209 Round 6: WR Jalen Camp

PFF gave the Jaguars a B+ last May for the 2021 class mostly lauding the Jaguars' selection of Lawrence at No. 1. Here is what PFF had to say about the rest of the Jaguars' draft class a year ago.

""Jacksonville hit a home run by landing Lawrence but struck out by taking Etienne with its second first-round pick. Unlike Harris Etienne is an explosive play waiting to happen; he racked up 37 runs that resulted in a gain of 25-plus yards since 2018 nine more than any other FBS back. He also greatly improved as a receiver grading out as the best running back in that facet last season. Still he won’t generate the value of a true first-round pick — no running back will.

""Investing in the cornerback position is never a bad strategy but Jacksonville is adding to a group that already has a lot more invested in the incumbent starters — specifically 2020 first-round pick C.J. Henderson and free-agent acquisition Shaquill Griffin. Campbell is also an outside corner which leaves him as a future option more than an early candidate to see playing time unless Henderson can feature in the slot. The elephant in the room is that Campbell was the 108th-ranked player on PFF’s Big Board.""

""Little’s NFL projection requires some imagination given that he’s played just 72 total snaps over the course of the last two seasons. A 2019 injury and 2020 opt-out have kept Little from being able to show his development on a football field. This still stands out as a strong bet for the Jaguars given Little’s physical tools and an 81.2 pass-blocking grade as a true sophomore at Stanford in 2018. Little was PFF’s OT4 and a top-30 player overall on the big board.""

""Cisco’s tape is a rollercoaster. He has some of the best range size and playmaking ability in this class tallying 26 combined pass breakups and interceptions across 24 games at Syracuse. Jacksonville will just have to live with some reads from Cisco that take him out of position opening the door for big plays by the opposing offense. The Jaguars are clearly placing an emphasis on the secondary with both of their Day 2 picks addressing that group.

Smith has an NFL build for the edge and was highly productive at UAB. He’s coming off back-to-back seasons with 90-plus PFF pass-rushing grades. He just doesn’t look like an NFL athlete based on his pro-day testing namely a 7.82-second three-cone time that ranks in the third percentile at the position.""

But what about a year later? With the Jaguars getting a B+ from PFF in 2021 does the grade remain the same or grow worse a year later especially after an unproductive year from Lawrence?

Well according to PFF the grade remains just as it was. Yes there were production concerns but there were also flashes from Lawrence and Campbell who clearly outplayed his pre-draft ranking by PFF.

""With so many selections the evaluation of this draft is all over the map. Trevor Lawrence is still a big TBD even though his Week 18 performance against the Colts in which he earned an 83.8 grade showed why he was the no-brainer at No. 1 overall"" PFF said.

""Travis Etienne missed the entire season with injury Walker Little was always drafted to be a backup as a rookie and former head coach Urban Meyer forgot Andre Cisco even existed. Tyson Campbell had an inconsistent rookie campaign but made a handful of high-end plays finishing with two picks and eight pass breakups.""

This is a fair grade for the Jaguars at this point. Heck a plain B or even a B- likely would have been just as fair. The Jaguars got serious flashes out of Lawrence and Campbell but they still need both to prove they can be consistent. Cisco and Little played well when they played but those chances came few and far in between. Etienne missed the entire year while Tufele and Smith had redshirt years Farrell was a non-factor and Camp didn't make the team.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8va2FzaG1pcm9ic2VydmVyLm5ldC8yMDIyLzA1LzI4L2xpbmNvbG4tbGF3eWVyLWEtcmV2aXZhbC1vZi10aGUtbGF3LWdlbnJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lincoln Lawyer: A Revival of the Law Genre,"By Neha Fayaz

WHEN legal dramas such as Suits and How to get away with Murder released the world didn’t only hail the plot of these shows that were coupled with brilliant execution but it also highlighted the excellence of the lead characters. To think of someone else other than Gabriel Swann Macht or Viola Davis playing the roles of Harvey Specter and Annalise Keating doesn’t quite bode well. Now with the advent of recognition for shows in other languages such as Korean Japanese French and German the competition to perform well on OTT platforms like Netflix Amazon Prime and Hotstar has intensified for entities in the ‘showbiz’ industry. On May 13th 2022 Lincoln Lawyer starring Manuel Garcia Rulfo Neve Cambel and Becki Newton to name a few released. Till now audiences worldwide equated The Lincoln Lawyer to Mathhew McConaughey and rightly so. With his captivating acting skills and evergreen charm McConaughey fit into the role perfectly. However the coming of Rulfo as the ‘new Lincoln Lawyer’ has indeed posed a legitimate competition to McConaughey’s character.

The show’s title represents the nickname given to the lead character Mickey Haller who is always on the move from one courtroom to another which propels him to carry out most of his work in the back of his car which is a Lincoln. The series which spans 10 episodes opens up with the audience being introduced to Rulfo’s character Mikey Haller a once renowned criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles. However after an oxy addiction caused by a surfing accident Haller was thrown off the bandwagon into a spiral that entailed him getting a divorce being remarried and getting a divorce again. Lorna Crain played by Becki Newtonis Holler’s second wife and throughout the series we see her as his closest friend loyal supporter and also his paralegal. In Mikey’s one year break as he was in between rehab Lorna tried her best to keep his practice afloat.

Shows that usually have the protagonist’s ex wife’s boyfriend in the lead tend to have a forced and rather awkward dynamic. However Cisco played by Angus Sampson shared a very comfortable bond with Haller. Cisco is a private detective for Mickey Haller and like a godfather to Mickey’s daughter. Upon Cisco informing Mickey that he and Lorna will be getting married the latter made his concerns for Lorna’s wellbeing clear but was genuinely supportive.

In Episode one Haller gets a call from Judge Mary Holder to visit her office. An elated Lorna pushes Mikey to be positive as this might be a call for Mickey to take on a case assigned by the judge which might also eventually be a chance to get back on his feet. To the surprise of both the audience and Mikey Judge Holder breaks the information that Mickey will be handed a law practice that was left behind by his friend and peer Jerry Vincent who was also recently murdered. The series thus delves into 10 episodes of riveting courtroom drama where Mickey not only gets one but all of Jerry’s pending cases. The most prominent one centered around tech mogul- Trevor Elliot. Accused of killing his wife and her boyfriend when he found them together in his bedroom the state makes a strong case of murder againsnt Elliot. The series showcases the myriad of ways that Haller tried to get evidence supporting Elliot’s innocence.

This also gives room for the audience to play the role of jury in their own minds to arrive at the conclusion of Elliot being either innocent or guilty. Haller was proud of his profession even if it meant representing criminals as he believed every person had the right to be represented. As time passes his decision of representing Elliot however makes him question that belief. Whilst this plot carries on seamlessly the show also delves into the relationship Haller shares with his daughter Hayley. During his addiction to oxy Mickey’s first wife Maggie had taken preventive measures of limiting her daughter’s interaction with him. However post rehab we not only see a positive turnout on Maggie’s relation with Mickey but also the blossoming father-daughter bond. This adds an interesting dimension to the series. For instance there comes a point where Haller discreetly posts security outside Maggie’s and Hayley’s house to ensure that him being Elliot’s counsel does not pose a threat to their safety. The series during its entirety also digs into the mystery behind Jerry Vincent’s death and his reason for leaving his practice under Haller’s care.

Even though the show delves into a myriad of themes it carries out the storylines and plots successfully. It does not portray itself to be forced but rather seems to be a product of effortless execution and acting. In a sea of series being put on OTT platforms The Lincoln Lawyer is not only a fresh break from the overhyped ‘machismo’ portrayed in law series but also gives insight into the flaws and gaping holes in the American justice system while providing the audience with a good introduction to the same.

Shocking moment a gust of wind almost knocked over world's 7th tallest building

Strong winds almost felled the world's seventh tallest building due to a major structural flaw - but luckily a student saved the day.

The Citicorp Center in New York was built in 1977 and was the world’s 7th tallest building at that time.

But without the intervention of Princeton University student Diane Hartley the skyscraper could have been toppled by 70mph.

The building housed the headquarters of Citibank in Manhattan and took three years to construct at the price of $175million.

Despite the expensive price tag the building had a major flaw which threatened to bring it down.

Expert architects failed to notice this flaw and in fact it wasn't until Diane called them that it came to light.

In the original design potential wind loads for the building had been incorrectly calculated - with estimates suggesting the building could be toppled by 70mph winds.

Solutions were attempted to correct the problem but more and more issues started appearing.

The issue was that the entire structure was vulnerable to being knocked over by a strong enough storm because the first nine floors of the building were on stilts.

Below the Citi building is a church St. Peter's Lutheran Church which refused to move and left the architects with a headache.

They decided the best solution was to continue the building and place Citi over the church.

The church agreed to renovations and the plan went ahead.

However the stilts were placed in the middle of the building to avoid the church meaning instability was created.

Structural engineer William LeMessurier and a team proposed a solution to the problem.

They thought of placing V-shaped chevrons on the building frame that transferred floor loads to the centre.

But eight-stories high chevrons only created more problems as it meant Citi’s structure was extremely light compared to other skyscrapers.

Strong winds could even cause the building to start swaying.

Therefore another solution was proposed: a tuned mass damper weighing 400-ton that vibrates to reduce sway.

When skyscrapers are built architects must account for two types of wind that may affect the building.

Perpendicular wind hits the structure face on whereas quartering wind strikes the corners of a building.

Although skyscrapers are normally strongest at their corners Citi was not and was left vulnerable to strong winds.

LeMessurier had modelled the building for perpendicular winds but not quartering winds which actually posed the most danger to Citi.

One day Diana then a university undergraduate at Princeton called LeMessurier’s office in 1978.

Image: Stephen Chernin/Getty Images) Stephen Chernin/Getty Images)

She was researching the building for a thesis paper flagged the issue of quartering wind and was correct in her analysis.

Using the information LeMessurier’s team figured out that a storm with winds strong enough to knock the tower over come around once every 55 years.

However for that to be the case the 400-ton damper would need to work without issue.

If a storm cut the power it could take a much weaker storm to knock Citi over.

Suddenly the team realised that a storm with winds strong enough to cause serious damage to the tower may appear every 16 years or so.

The situation was a potential disaster and needed an urgent solution.

Things started to get worse when a category four hurricane began to form on the East Coast in August 1978.

If it hit New York and Citi fell thousands of people were at risk of being killed.

The fix was to weld steel plates over the tower’s bolted joints costing $8million with the insurance only covering £2million.

LeMessurier pressured Citi to act quickly and help was found.

MIT-trained engineer John S. Reed was a Citi EVP and together they persuaded the company’s board to take action.

A plan was put in place to covertly execute the welding process and two and a half thousand police officers and Red Cross volunteers were placed on standby for a potential evacuation.

The work was carried out in the evenings and early mornings over several weeks.

Worker strikes at a number of newspapers at the time such as the New York Times meant word did not spread about what was happening at Citi.

Thankfully the hurricane which threatened to knock the tower over never came to New York but one of the world’s tallest buildings came perilously close to being the site of a huge catastrophe.

The story was not known for years until a writer at the New Yorker overheard it at a party and interviewed LeMessurier.

By Yi Whan-woo







The country's regional banks are shutting down their branches over the declining profitability of offline services which in turn is casting doubts over the feasibility of President Yoon Suk-yeol's plan to relocate Seoul-headquartered financial institutions outside the nation's capital.







Yoon has been singling out state-run policy lender Korea Development Bank (KDB) in his relocation plan but also hinted at pressuring other state-owned institutions to move their headquarters by saying ""Relocating only KDB will not be enough.""







Whether the relocation will contribute to Yoon's goal of balanced regional development is not certain considering demand for face-to-face financial services is slowing in provincial areas due to population declines and greater reliance on digital banking.

The unfavorable offline banking business environment is evident in the decreasing number of branches among five major regional lenders ― Busan Bank Kyongnam Bank Daegu Bank Kwangju Bank and Jeonbuk Bank ― between 2020 and 2021.







Busan Bank saw its number of branches falling from 232 to 212 during the cited period according to data from the Financial Supervisory Service. The figure diminished from 146 to 132 for Kyongnam Bank 235 to 232 for Daegu Bank 146 to 143 for Kwangju Bank and 97 to 92 for Jeonbuk Bank.







The situation is likely to get worse this year with each of the five considering merging or shutting down more branches.







""We tried to close branches as little as possible despite constant population decline and a fall in the number of offline customers. But such tactics are being drastically revised because otherwise we can't withstand falling profitability over rapid digitalization"" a regional bank official said on condition of anonymity.







Accordingly experts urge the Yoon administration to be prudent in relocating the financial institutions.







""I agree on a need for balanced regional development and capitalizing on the financial industry to fulfill that goal"" said Jung Ho-chul a program coordinator at the Economic Policy Department of Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice a civic activist group. ""But the approach being made by the government does not appear to be based on a thorough understanding of the regional financial industry.""







He argued it is mostly state-run lenders including Export-Import Bank of Korea (Eximbank) and Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) that are being mentioned as potential financial institutions for relocation.







""It is believed the banks are targeted simply because the banking business is the most representative sector in finance. This idea is very sloppy and will lead to nowhere regarding the success of Yoon's plan"" Jung said.







Another activist shared a similar view.







""The starting point for the relocation project should be understanding the unique roles of each financial institution and how their traits can harmonize with regions to which they can be relocated"" said Lee Ji-woo a coordinator at the Center of Economic and Financial Justice at People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy.







As a possible solution for balanced regional development Lee suggested ""making sure consumers in rural areas will have more options to choose from in financial services.""







Jung suggested enhancing regional banks' roles and figuring out the specific financial sector that foreign financial companies are interested in by region.







For instance he noted the provincial governments select the banks to manage their primary and subsidiary coffers through a bid as stipulated by the law on provincial banking.







The list of criteria for a successful bidder includes credit ratings and financial soundness regarding which regional banks find it tough to outpace the five major commercial banks headquartered in Seoul ― KB Kookmin Shinhan Hana Woori and NongHyup.







As a result it is the Seoul-headquartered banks that win the bids to manage massive amounts of money belonging to the provincial governments.







""Although not intended the bid works against the regional banks not for them given the fact that they have relatively weak competiveness against much bigger rivals from Seoul"" Jung said. ""A revision of the law therefore is urgently needed for regional banks to better contribute to their respective economies.""







Regarding foreign financial companies he noted those from the United States and other Western countries are heavily concentrated in Seoul but it is not the case in Busan.







He explained that Chinese Singaporean and other Asian companies find derivatives securities and other marine industry-related financial products worth investing and therefore come to Busan Korea's largest port city.







""You can see that it does not necessarily have to be banks to draw foreign investors to areas other than Seoul"" Jung said.







Meanwhile the regional banks are pushing to develop customized services to cope with the changing banking environment.







Busan Bank has launched a consulting service desk for senior citizens aged 65 or older who still prefer offline banking services and have difficulty understanding a variety of financial terms.







Kyongnam Bank is keeping the number of ATMs while planning to introduce an online consulting service.







Jeonbuk Bank has formed a partnership with post offices so that the post offices can offer simple banking services such as cash withdrawal and deposit and opening an account for Jeonbuk Bank clients in addition to their customers.

Alyssa Nakken San Francisco’s trailblazing major-league assistant was glad to see the memo from the league last week first reported by ESPN that admonished a number of teams for failing to provide adequate facilities for traveling female staffers even though she said “overall I think it’s been pretty positive.”

Under guidelines provided before the 2021 season every MLB stadium is to provide clean private locker rooms for women with showers and restrooms that is in close proximity to the home and visiting clubhouses.

In the memo obtained by ESPN MLB senior vice president of on-field operations Michael Hill wrote that numerous stadiums “fall embarrassingly below the high standards.” Multiple female staffers told ESPN anonymously about the difficulties they have had finding restrooms in visiting ballparks to the point of cutting in to the time they are able to spend performing the actual duties of their job.

“I haven’t wasted too much time but it is something that we have to think about in some ballparks figuring out where the restrooms are” Nakken said Sunday in an interview with the Bay Area News Group. “We’ve had a private locker room I think in every stadium we’ve been to. There’s some where the bathroom situation is a little tough.”

Giants manager Gabe Kapler echoed the message sent in the memo and backed up by Nakken.

“Some ballparks are in much better shape to accommodate the women on our staff and others are working through it now and need to get better” Kapler said declining to name specific stadiums.

Nakken believes there can be a collaborative effort to design an area that is accessible for all.

“When it comes to infrastructure I think there’s a lot of really intelligent people in the league on certain clubs and on the staff if we bring those people together we can come up with a really cool design” Nakken said. “Just something that’s easy to get to the dugout the dining area the weight room the locker room … for everybody involved. The entire travel party. Players staff support staff medical personnel.”

While Nakken is the only female coach on the Giants staff — or any team in MLB — she is joined by a handful of other women in San Francisco’s traveling party who work in other areas of baseball operations.

Earlier this season Nakken made more history by becoming the first woman to appear in an on-field role when she took over for Antoan Richardson as the first base coach in a game against the San Diego Padres.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaS5jb20vbWxiL3BoaWxsaWVzL3Byb3NwZWN0cy9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtcGhpbGxpZXMtcHJvc3BlY3QtamVyc2V5LXNob3JlLWJsdWVjbGF3cy1ldGhhbi13aWxzb24tYnJ5Y2UtaGFycGVyLWNvbXBhcmlzb25zLWhlYXRpbmctdXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drawing Comparisons to Harper Philadelphia Phillies Prospect Wilson is Heating Up,"Philadelphia Phillies prospect Ethan Wilson is beginning to shake off the dregs of spring and hit his stride in May.

It's cold and rainy up in Lakewood New Jersey. Ethan Wilson's group is scheduled to take practice swings soon but right now his Jersey Shore BlueClaws teammates occupy the batting cage.

""I'm not really used to playing in cold weather"" said Wilson the Philadelphia Phillies 2nd round pick in the 2021 MLB Amateur Draft.

Wilson grew up in Andalusia Alabama a town with a population just under 9000 all of whom could fit comfortably in his new home at ShoreTown Ballpark.

Wilson didn't stray far from his hometown for university either moving just 120 miles down the road to the University of South Alabama. There Wilson was an instant success slashing .346/.453/.686 in his freshman season.

Few hurdles stunted Wilson on the ballfield down south. He was a natural at South Alabama even drawing comparisons to fellow right fielder and 2021 NL MVP Bryce Harper.

But pro-ball is not college ball and Wilson's baptism into the Phillies minor leagues didn't go as smoothly as his introduction to college baseball. Slashing .215/.282/.374 in his 2021 minor league season with the Clearwater Threshers Wilson struggled for the first time.

""That's been one of the biggest adjustments for me trying to time up 95 [mph] on a nightly basis"" said Wilson. ""We never really saw anything above 93 94 [in college] and then pro-ball you're seeing 95-plus every night.""

Promoted to the Jersey Shore BlueClaws after a breakout spring training in which he took home the Phillies' Bill Giles Award for excellence in spring Wilson got off to another slow start.

Now armed with mentors and more experience Wilson has found a way to breakout of that slump.

Wilson frequently carpooled with Darick Hall in spring training who he affectionately calls ""D-Hall."" Both members of the Phillies minor league system were not on the 40-man roster during the lockout so Hall had extra time to take some of the younger prospects under his wing.

""One of the guys I gave rides to almost every day in spring training was Ethan Wilson"" said Hall ""I talked to him a lot about stuff and he was always asking questions which you love to hear.""

Wilson has now begun to show flashes of the player the Phillies expected when they took him in the 2nd round of last year's draft. Since May 3 he's slashed .262/.333/.400. Wilson's defense in right field has improved as well and he's stolen 13 bases in 36 games becoming a more well-rounded player by the day.

He's still two levels away from playing with the Phillies but fans should keep an eye on Wilson. Nearly 23-years-old he's not that much younger than many of the other players on the big league roster.

Wilson is certainly keeping an eye on the Phillies.

""I try to watch the Phillies every opportunity that I get"" Wilson said. And like many others around the Delaware Valley he thinks there's more to this team than what we've seen so far.

""Obviously their record isn't where it needs to be right now but it's really early. I think they'll hit their stride and finish on a good note.""

Jack Harris at the Los Angeles Times profiled Dodgers closer Craig Kimbrel particularly noting the contrast between the right-hander’s persona both on and off the mound.

Among the many notes in Jayson Stark’s latest column at The Athletic is that the 1939 Yankees hold the MLB record with a +401 run differential. The Dodgers are on pace to break that this season.

Matt Monagan at MLB.com chronicled the various records for visiting teams at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia eating chessesteaks. Included among the champions within is Chad Chop who was a video coordinator for the Dodgers in 2019-20. Before that Chop was with the Giants when he ate a then-record 10 cheesesteaks in one day in Philly.

I was a guest on the FnA podcast Friday with Adam Auslund and Kevin Figgers at 570 AM talking Dodgers and more.

Through these devices lactate present in sweat is used to harvest energy in a fuel cell format.The researchers — Jayapiriya US a research Scholar and Sanket Goel  professor department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering  designed two types of electronic devices — one using a modified band-aid with pencil electrodes generating power of 115 mW/m2 and another using nanomaterial coated carbon cloth electrode generating power of 1.3 W/m2.“Two different biofuel cells have been fabricated with a patch type configuration to harvest power from lactate present in human sweat. In the first method pencil strokes were made on a simple band-aid to create a biofuel cell. While lactate acts as an electrode graphene acts as both anode and cathode” Goel told TOI. He said that different types of enzymes are added to graphene so that they act as cathode or anode.In the second method researchers used carbon cloth-based electrodes to convert lactate in sweat into energy.Goel said that the energy generated can either be directly used when it is generated or can be saved and used later by using a capacitor.The ultimate aim of these prototypes is to power wearable electronic applications such as fitness trackers headphones smart glass and sensors among others the researchers said. “The minimum voltage required to startup a fitness watch is around 1.8 V for which an array of our patch-type fuel cell can be used to supply the required voltage” Goel added. “Using glucose to harvest energy can be useful to power battery of the peacemaker a battery-operated device that sends el impulses to the heart muscle to maintain a suitable heart rate andrhythm” he added.

(NEXSTAR) – Coca-Cola is reading the tea leaves — and they aren’t too optimistic about Honest Tea.

The beverage which was founded in 1998 and acquired by the Coca-Cola Company in 2011 will be phased out of Coca-Cola’s portfolio by the end of the year the company confirmed earlier this week.

Coca-Cola cited decreasing sales as well as supply challenges for glass bottles as reasons for its decision to discontinue Honest Tea. The company also believes its other ready-to-drink tea brands — Gold Peak and Peace Tea — are better positioned for growth.

“Shifting from a three-brand tea portfolio to a prioritized two-brand tea lineup will free up investment resources and supply chain capacity to better meet consumer needs and capture share in the category” said Sabrina Tandon the group director of ready-to-drink teas for Coca-Cola North America stated in a press release.

Despite dropping Honest Tea from its portfolio Coca-Cola will continue to produce its Honest Kids line of beverages. The company will also retain ownership of the Honest Tea brand despite phasing out its products.

Aside from Honest Tea Gold Peak and Peace Tea the Coca-Cola Company’s coffee and tea portfolio includes Fuzetea and several brands sold largely overseas including Ayataka Costa Coffee Dogadan and Georgia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXJsb3R0ZW9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbmFzY2FyLWF1dG8tcmFjaW5nL2FydGljbGUyNjE4NjM4ODUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coke 600: NASCAR race TV channel and how to watch,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.charlotteobserver.com', port=443): Read timed out.

If you're a fan of sugar-sweetened beverages you're not alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nearly 50% of American adults report that they consume at least one sugary drink on a daily basis. And as far as Coke goes the popular cola beverage remains the top soft drink brand in the world. Coca-Cola's net operating revenue is close to $39 million and consumption in North America accounts for over one-third of that per Statista.

The bad news which should come as no surprise is that while you may enjoy that flavor and the crisp mouthfeel Coke has essentially no nutritional value and is loaded with sugar. According to the experts at Verywell Fit if you drink a 12-ounce serving of Coke you will also consume 39 grams of sugar. Drinking Coke may not seem like such a sweet idea when you consider that adult men and women should consume a maximum of 50 grams of added sugar per day according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The beverage it says was released by Coke in 1994 with a $30 million advertising effort to emulate fruity soda-alternatives like Snapple.

Snapple had taken off in the 1990s. The Washington Post reported that when Quaker bought Snapple in 1994 (the same year as Fruitopia's launch) the company's sales had reached a peak: $670 million. The non-carbonated fruit drink business was booming and for a while at least Coke's efforts worked too: TIME magazine hailed Fruitopia as one of the 10 best new products of 1994. But with such a popular launch where did this fan-favorite fruit fare disappear to?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZmFjdGNoZWNrLmFmcC5jb20vZG9jLmFmcC5jb20uMzJCMjNSRtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,False posts claiming 'Coca-Cola contains alcohol' circulate in Muslim-majority Malaysia,"False posts claiming 'Coca-Cola contains alcohol' circulate in Muslim-majority Malaysia

Copyright © AFP 2017-2024. All rights reserved.

Multiple Facebook posts shared repeatedly in Muslim-majority Malaysia claim that Coca-Cola contains alcohol meaning it is ""haram"" or forbidden in Islam. But both Coca-Cola and the Malaysian government agency responsible for Islamic affairs have separately said this is false. The posts shared a purported newspaper article screenshot that claimed to show an old recipe for the soft drink which has not been confirmed by Coca-Cola.

The post was shared here on Facebook on May 6 2022.

The post's Malaysian-language caption translates to English as: ""Alcohol... That's not permissible [in Islam]!!""

Screenshot of the misleading post captured on May 26 2022

The post contains a purported screenshot of a news article with the headline: ""After 125 yrs secret Coke formula is out.""

The article's byline is Times News Network an online news site based in the US.

AFP has not been able to verify where the purported article was published.

The article states that an old recipe for Coca-Cola which included alcohol was revealed by the popular podcast This American Life following the discovery of a 40-year-old report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Coca-Cola would not confirm the purported recipe following the claims made by This American Life in February 2011 the Guardian reported.

The newspaper screenshot was shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here here and here.

But the claim is false according to Coca-Cola and Malaysian authorities.

Non-alcoholic drink

A Coca-Cola Malaysia spokesman told AFP that whilst the recipe for Coca-Cola remained a ""closely guarded secret"" alcohol is not one of its current ingredients.

""Alcohol is not an added ingredient of Coca-Cola and no fermentation takes place when Coca-Cola is made"" the spokesman said.

""Our ingredients and manufacturing processes are rigorously regulated and regulatory authorities around the world have consistently recognised Coca Cola as non-alcoholic.

In Malaysia a halal certification can be obtained from the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (Jakim) the government agency responsible for the Islamic affairs in the country.

Below is a screenshot from the Halal Malaysia Official Portal which shows that Coca-Cola's distributor in Malaysia has a valid halal certification:

Police said the techie committed the crime hours after celebrating his wedding anniversary at home.The techie Prakash 41 left a suicide note on a wall saying no one was responsible for their deaths.His father-in-law Ramanan was the first to visit the crime scene when he entered the home on Saturday morning to hand over temple prasadam to his daughter P Gayathri 39. Ramanan found his daughter and grandchildren — Nithya Shree 13 and Harikrishnan 8 — lying in a pool of blood in the living room with their necks gashed. Prakash was lying a little away with the electric saw stuck on his neck.Police suspect Prakash might have sedated his family members before murdering them. High debts may have forced the techie to take the extreme step. Prakash worked at Cognizant Technologies Limited while his wife was running a traditional medicine shop in the neighbourhood. Nithya Shree was studying in Class IX and Harikrishnan in Class II. Preliminary inquiries revealed that Prakash had borrowed money to grow his wife’s business during the pandemic. As he failed to repay the money the debts amounted to more than 10 lakh said an investigation officer quoting Prakash’s neighbours and family members. Police have collected food samples and the cake left behind at the house for forensic examination to ascertain if the items had been laced with sedatives.

Corpuz who went to USC will meet college rival Lilian Vu in the knockout stage after winning their pods on Friday. Corpuz beat Sarah Schmelzel and Vu took out Esther Henseleit.

The rivals say they might have played together just once in their college days but they consider each other good friends. Vu hit the LPGA Tour in 2019 Corpuz is a rookie this year. Both are considered match play aces as they both won singles matches at the Curtis Cup. Corpuz won three matches in the 2021 edition in Wales and Vu won four in 2018 in New York with Punahou graduate Mariel Galdiano as a teammate and playing partner.

Corpuz never trailed in her win over Schmelzel taking the first hole with a par and playing even over the next seven holes. She caught fire from there winning the next five holes with a birdie and four pars to close out the match 6 and 5.

Schmelzel was hot off an 11th-place finish at the Cognizant Founders Cup but went winless in the round-robin portion of this tournament. Corpuz was the only unbeaten player in her group finishing ahead of 2022 Lotte Championship in Hawaii champion Hyo Joo Kim the event’s third seed. Corpuz beat Kim 3 and 2 in their match on Wednesday.

Corpuz is in seventh place in the Louise Suggs Rolex Rookie of the Year standings despite playing only six events. The leader Atthaya Thitikul of Thailand has played 10 events.

Vu beat Charley Hull 5 and 3 Ariya Jutanugarn 2 and 1 and Esther Henseleit 4 and 3. Both Corpuz and Vu have played 47 holes in the first three days but Vu is 6-1 on the last five holes while Corpuz is 2-1.

Caroline Masson beat top-seeded Minjee Lee 2 and 1 to finish 3-0 in the group stage.

Masson will face Andrea Lee today in the round of 16. Andrea Lee beat Stephanie Meadow 2 and 1 to take her group at 2-0-1.

After Minjee Lee coming off a victory two weeks ago in the Founders Cup won the 14th and 15th to pull within one Masson ended the match with a par on the 17th.

“I knew it was going to be tough” Masson said. “Minjee is a great player. She’s been playing great the last — well years really but the last few weeks as well. Also it’s match play and I feel like pretty much anybody can beat anybody out here. I just trusted in my game. Feel like I been hitting it good. I was in control.”

Masson also had 2-and-1 victories over Brittany Altomare on Wednesday and Youngin Chun on Thursday. The four-time Solheim Cup player from Germany won her lone LPGA Tour title in 2016.

“It’s been a cool three days” Masson said. “I think this golf course is really hard so I feel like I didn’t really play my best but also I think many players probably feel that same way. I really made the most of it and just really happy to close it out today.”

Minjee Lee ranked fourth in the world was 1-2.

Seven of the 16 weekend qualifiers swept their groups with Madelene Sagstrom Jodi Ewart Shadoff Paula Reto Tiffany Chan Vu and Hye-Jin Choi matching Masson at 3-0.

Sagstrom beat Ryann O’Toole 2 and 1 to set up a match against Emma Talley.

“I feel all right so far” Sagstrom said. “It’s hot. You’re trying to drink and just rest as much as possible and kind of what I’ve been doing. My caddie was a bit angry with me. He’s like `Come on Madelene I don’t want to walk 18 holes.’”

Shadoff topped Jasmine Suwannapura 3 and 2. She will face Chan

“Really happy with where my game is at” Shadoff said. “I think being a good ball-striker is really an advantage around here. The greens are really firm. Just taking advantage of the shots that I’m hitting. So yeah I’m looking forward to the weekend.”

Las Vegas resident Jenny Shin rallied for a draw with Haeji Kang to advance with a 2-0-1 record. She will face Annie Park.

“I made golf really difficult today so I’m very happy to have tied to advance to the 16” Shin said.

She normally avoids playing in the afternoon heat.

“I just don’t come out at this time” Shin said. “My practice starts at 6 and ends way before it gets really hot. I wouldn’t torture myself and put myself out here.”

Two groups were decided in playoffs with Gemma Dryburgh beating Gaby Lopez and Moriya Jutanugarn edging Ashleigh Buhai. Both won with pars on the first hole. They will face each other today.

In the other matches in the round of 16 Choi will face Eun-Hee Ji and Reto will meet Ayaka Furue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYXNoLm5ldC9mMS9yZXN1bHRzLzEwMDQyMjgvMS9mMS13b3JsZC1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtcG9pbnRzLXN0YW5kaW5ncy1hZnRlci0yMDIyLW1vbmFjby1ncNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F1 World Championship points standings after the 2022 Monaco GP,"F1 World Championship points standings after the 2022 Monaco GP

She also wrote As If: The Complete Oral History of Clueless. Photo: Paramount Pictures

If you were alive and cognizant in the early 1980s you remember when America first developed a crush on Tom Cruise. It happened when he slid sock-footed and pants-free to the sound of Bob Seger in Risky Business. But three years later in 1986 when Cruise’s naval-officer grin in Top Gun spread across cineplex screens from sea to shining sea? That’s when Americans fell in love.

There was something about Cruise as Lieutenant Pete “Maverick” Mitchell — his motorcycle-revving exuberance and a charm just potent enough to undercut his arrogance — that was irresistible. It certainly helped that Maverick personified two fundamental American values that are completely at odds with each other: a belief in the exceptionalism of the military and an admiration of individualistic authority-defying rebels. Maverick was all of that in one package the best fighter pilot in the Navy and a guy whose ego very famously wrote checks his body couldn’t cash. He could fly an F14 Tomcat upside down and flip a Russian pilot the bird then enrage his superiors while still convincing them he had done the right thing.

More than any other role he would play — and yes I am counting Ethan Hunt in the Mission: Impossible movies — Maverick defined Tom Cruise within the public imagination. Many of the characters he would take on during the three decades that followed would share some of the same core qualities as his Top Gun persona: daring defiant athletic incredibly hardworking and willing to put their lives on the line to achieve a seemingly insurmountable goal. Cruise’s own personal image especially in recent years has been built around these traits too.

All of that Cruiseyness runs deep in the veins of Top Gun: Maverick the sequel to 1986’s Top Gun. The follow-up is certainly its own entity and in many ways a more emotionally resonant experience than the first because it reckons so directly with the passage of time. As our film critic Bilge Ebiri put it in his review this is “a movie haunted by the image of its own star and of an America that may not exist anymore.”

But there are also enough direct callbacks to the original to make Top Gun: Maverick feel a bit like a remake of Top Gun as well as when viewed through the prism of Tom Cruise’s filmography a reflection of many other movies he has starred in during his long career. (I said many not every. There are no reminders of The Mummy in Top Gun: Maverick and I am grateful for it.)

Note: This is the part where a lot of Top Gun: Maverick spoilers will start to appear.

Top Gun: Maverick is basically just Top Gun again.

Top Gun: Maverick starts exactly the way Top Gun does with the low thrum of Harold Faltermeyer’s “Top Gun Anthem” a title card that explains the history of the elite Fighter Weapons School at Miramar imagery of planes revving up and taking off and a transition from Faltermeyer’s music to Kenny Loggins’s “Danger Zone.” This may be the most “it’s 1986 again!” thing I’ve ever witnessed and I’ve seen the new season of Stranger Things and also used to host a college radio show called “Cheezin’ Through the ’80s.”

In addition to the presence of Goose’s fighter-pilot son — call sign Rooster — there are photos of Anthony Edwards’s Goose sprinkled into many scenes along with replays of sequences involving him from the first movie. Rooster played by Miles Teller even sits at a piano in a bar and plays “Great Balls of Fire” like his daddy did in the same shirt and mustache too.

As in the first film Tom Cruise rides a motorcycle adjacent to departing planes because he will always have the need the need for speed. He returns to Miramar this time to be an instructor and does another of his infamous inverted dives while in flight. Maverick naturally makes sure to reserve some time for shirtless athletics. While Top Gun offered the beach volleyball scene one of the most homoerotic sequences in mainstream American cinema and easily the most homoerotic sequence set to a Kenny Loggins song Top Gun: Maverick gives us Nerf football on the beach. But honestly? Same thing.

While Kelly McGillis’s Charlie Blackwood is notably absent from this sequel Maverick does have a love interest who lives in a charming house whose exterior kinda sorta resembles the beach bungalow in which Charlie lived. But if you think Penny Benjamin played by an absolutely gleaming Jennifer Connelly is a new character created entirely for Top Gun: Maverick think again. In Top Gun: Maverick even the smallest details provide an opportunity for another callback.

Honestly very funny that while Tom Cruise has a new non-Kelly McGillis love interest in TOP GUN 2 TOP GUN lore has been maintained pic.twitter.com/7QDZqDsNxR — Alison Willmore (@alisonwillmore) May 10 2022

As in Top Gun the enemies in Top Gun: Maverick are never identified. Okay we all basically knew that the bad guys in the first movie were the Russians even though that’s never explicitly stated. But there’s even more mystery surrounding the military exercise that the young pilots are training for in Maverick. The country where it’s supposed to happen is never named. As in Top Gun the identities of the enemy pilots are completely hidden behind very dark helmets. This allows Top Gun: Maverick like its predecessor to go full rah-rah for our American men and women in uniform without ever wading into politics or the thorny reasons why the U.S. may be attacking this random location. This is all good for global box-office prospects of course.

Actually the real enemy in both Top Gun movies isn’t a non-American country. It’s anyone who stands in Tom Cruise’s way. Because of course Maverick will eventually break protocol take matters into his own hands in a way that puts multiple lives at risk and nevertheless emerge as the hero. That is why he’s called … Maverick. Look when Tom Cruise also an EP of Top Gun: Maverick promises the world he’s going to make another Top Gun movie he really means he’s going to make another Top Gun.

Top Gun: Maverick is a Mission: Impossible movie.

The major storyline in this film focuses on a top-secret mission that is so challenging the best recent graduates of Top Gun have been called back into service to get it done while Maverick — in case you forgot the best of the best — has been invited to guide them. Basically this group of pilots has to fly into a narrow canyon drop bombs on a uranium production facility at the precise right moment then zoom out of there as quickly as possible without being blown up by enemy fire. One could very accurately say this mission sounds … impossible? The attention to detail about how to execute that mission and the tense depiction of how it gets pulled off — spoiler but come on not really: only Tom Cruise can really do this — would not seem at all out of place in one of Cruise’s Ethan Hunt-driven vehicles.

Top Gun: Maverick is ﻿The Color of Money

The Color of Money also released in 1986 post–Top Gun was a sequel to The Hustler which came out 25 years prior to its sequel. (Top Gun: Maverick is landing in theaters following multiple COVID delays 36 years after the first.) In it Paul Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddie Felson at the age of 61; Cruise is returning to screens as Maverick roughly a month before his 60th birthday. In The Color of Money Fast Eddie becomes a pool-playing mentor to the unpredictable hotshot Vincent played by Cruise. In Top Gun: Maverick Maverick becomes a mentor to a bunch of hotshot pilots while also still being a hotshot pilot because Tom Cruise is old but also young and also the only person who can truly solve all problems.

Top Gun: Maverick is Risky Business

Admittedly this is a bit of a stretch since Top Gun: Maverick is not about a prostitution business or trying to get into Princeton or contending with Guido the Killer Pimp. However the catchphrase that winds up becoming a life philosophy for Cruise’s Joel Goodsen — “Sometimes you gotta say ‘What the fuck?’” — is also a mantra for Maverick in both Top Guns. One could say the same about other Cruise characters who are nearly all risk-takers. In short Joel from Risky Business said “What the fuck?” and walked so that Maverick in Top Gun and Top Gun: Maverick could say “What the fuck?” and fly a plane into the stratosphere.

Top Gun: Maverick is The Edge of Tomorrow

In this underrated action film released in theaters eight summers ago Cruise plays a member of the military who gets stuck in a time loop and keeps revisiting the same moment over and over again and I’m sorry but don’t tell me that could not also be the logline for Top Gun: Maverick.

Top Gun: Maverick is Above All a Movie About Tom Cruise

The public’s feelings about Cruise a man the New York Times has dubbed “Hollywood’s last real movie star” has (understatement) taken some twists and turns over the years. Following his fascinatingly messy divorce from Katie Holmes and heightened scrutiny over his Scientology connections he risked becoming a persona non grata instead of a blockbuster-making machine. Then he quietly rejiggered his image.

He started to focus solely on action movie roles. In nearly all those roles from Ethan Hunt to Jack Reacher to Barry Seal in the very smart American Made he embodied the very qualities that defined Maverick: confident determined respectful of rules but always more than willing to break them. He has come across the same way in interviews and media coverage. He’s the guy who does all the stunts himself which is both reckless and a sign of his work ethic (very Maverick). He’s also someone who keeps his emotions in check (also very Maverick) and his personal life these days to himself.

In Top Gun: Maverick another character points out that Pete doesn’t really have any ties. He never married; he has no kids. His life is his work. That’s who Tom Cruise is to us now too. He’s the movie star who projects his commitment to movie stardom at all times as if that’s all we care to know about him. For many that is all we care to know. Or maybe not knowing much makes it easier to keep enjoying his movies which I think that many still want to be able to do.

Since his split from Holmes and his full turn toward action fare Cruise has also relinquished his status as a sex symbol which was so central to his image in the first half of his career that it’s astonishing how easily it disappeared. He almost never does love scenes anymore. Rarely does he make headlines because of who he is dating and even when he does it’s a blip that barely registers.

Top Gun: Maverick notably gives Cruise an active love interest something that has become a rarity in his recent films. But unlike so many other elements in this sequel it departs from the first Top Gun by not really showing Maverick and Penny have sex. There is a romantic scene that implies the two of them do the deed but it is wildly tamer than the “Take My Breath Away” tongue bath Cruise and McGillis acted out back in 1986. With her ebony hair teal-colored eyes and camera-ready smile from certain angles Connelly could even pass as a female version of Cruise. Which is perfect somehow.

Finally as Cruise’s career comes full circle back to the movie that really made him his romantic counterpart has become basically himself. Top Gun: Maverick is at its essence a film that asks us to believe the world revolves around Tom Cruise. It is the most Tom Cruise movie imaginable standing in front of the world and asking us to love it and him. When you settle into your reclining stadium seat and stare once more upon that wide almost patriotic Maverick smile don’t be surprised at how eager you are to love him right back."

Dividend Kings keep getting more attractive as the stock market seems shakier with every passing day. Inflation war interest rate hikes and slumping earnings. There’s plenty to be worried about.

As any study of long-term investing will show it’s time in the market that makes the difference. Investors have to keep capital in stocks to get the benefits of long-term compounding. With that in mind investors have to find stocks and construct a portfolio that can withstand recessions and bear markets.

There’s no better place to look for such resilient companies than the Dividend Kings. These are the companies that have increased their dividends for at least 50 years in a row.

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 67

At 67 years in a row American States Water currently has the longest-running consecutive dividend increase streak of the S&P 500 companies.

It’s not too hard to see why. Water utilities are among the most stable businesses out there. Regardless of what is going on with the economy people need fresh clean water.

Story continues

American States Water has been able to leverage that consistent demand into a solid growth rate with earnings per share increasing around 7%/year annually over the past decade.

In turn American States Water has increased its dividend by a similar amount annually as well. AWR stock offers a dividend yield of 1.9% which is certainly not the highest on this list.

However its unmatched record in terms of how long it has delivered annual dividend hikes and the inherent stability of its underlying business make American States Water a solid defensive Dividend King.

Dover is a diversified industrial company. It operates in a wide variety of segments including imaging and ID services pumps climate and sustainability technologies and engineered products.

Dover is not a particularly glamorous business but it keeps steadily ticking along. Earnings have grown 5% per year annualized over the past decade which has given it sufficient margin to keep increasing its dividend.

DOV stock is also a timely pick right now. Shares are down nearly 25% year to date. This has led DOV stock to sell at just 15 times forward earnings which is near its cheapest valuation of the past decade.

As with many Dividend Kings Dover is not the sort of company that will make anyone a fortune overnight but this steady industrial company serves as a top-notch growth and income machine over the long term.

Coca-Cola is one of Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks and it’s not hard to see why. The company sells almost $40 billion in soda and other beverages each and every year.

Regardless of what happens with the economy or political conditions Coca-Cola continues to sell the same amount of refreshments.

Soda isn’t much of a growth industry anymore. However Coca-Cola has done well in diversifying into other beverages such as water juices and sparkling water.

Meanwhile given the company’s unparalleled scale it has maintained strong cost advantages over its rivals leading to enviable profit margins.

Coca-Cola isn’t going to deliver strong short-term capital gains but its 2.8% dividend yield is rock solid and the company has raised that payout every year in a row dating back to the 1960s.

Emerson Electric (EMR)

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 65

A company with 65 consecutive years of dividend hikes might seem old-fashioned. However companies don’t become Dividend Kings without being able to evolve.

Emerson for example began as an industrial firm focused on making goods such as electric fans sewing machines and power tools. Over the decades Emerson has transformed itself. Nowadays the company is increasingly becoming a software company focusing on the automation of factories and industrial processes.

This is crucial technology right now. Supply chain issues and runaway inflation have made it more vital than ever to get the most out of a company’s existing manufacturing processes.

Emerson’s focus on efficiency and reducing industrial waste for its customers also stands out in the current marketplace which favors environmental social and governance (ESG) friendly investments.

Sometimes an old dog can learn new tricks and Emerson’s transformation into a forward-looking automation company has been one such impressive example.

3M is an American industrial giant. It is most well-known for Post-It notes. However the company makes a vast array of products spanning safety equipment adhesives dental supplies industrial filters and much more.

In short 3M is a diversified conglomerate that in effect is a bet on American industry itself.

MMM stock is also shockingly cheap as it currently sells for just 13 times forward earnings. Traders are worried about the impact of a recession on the company along with some pending lawsuits around product liability.

Once these concerns pass however 3M shares should return to a more generous valuation ratio offering significant capital gains. In the meantime shares offer a compelling 4.1% dividend yield.

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 66

Northwest Natural is a utility that operates primarily in Oregon and Washington.

Utilities tend to be a very stable business and Northwest Natural has been no exception to that rule. Generally gas utilities earn a regulated return rate and receive upward adjustments for inflation giving investors a reliable stream of cash flows over the decades.

Northwest Natural is not a compelling growth story by any means; it has grown revenues by about 2% per year compounded over the past decade.

However for investors that like a stable income story with a small annual increase NWN stock’s 3.5% starting dividend yield might be just the ticket.

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 60

Toothpaste and cleaning products maker Colgate-Palmolive has had a forgettable decade.

In 2012 Colgate generated $17.1 billion in revenue. In 2021 this rose to just $17.4 billion which is a less than 1% annualized growth rate. Despite the brief surge in purchases with the pandemic Colgate has struggled to show much top-line growth.

Regardless the company’s dividend growth story rolls on. Due to sizable share buybacks and cost-cutting Colgate has managed to grow underlying earnings and in association its dividend payout despite the lack of revenue growth.

The 2020s may look better than the 2010s. Colgate has a huge presence in emerging markets and thus suffered as many of those countries saw weak economic performance in recent years. Now however with oil metals and agricultural prices through the roof countries such as Brazil should see stronger economic performance and thus lead to a solid upswing in Colgate’s profitability.

Instead of opting for a spherical shape that comes with the Amazon Echo and Apple HomePod Mini or even the rounded rectangular look of the Google Nest Audio device a sketch shows what appears to be a speaker with a sloped top and a wide base.

Online records show that Comcast first filed for the patent last year but it didn’t get approved until April 2022. As seen in the sketch the device seems to have playback controls on the side of the speaker with an additional button and a small stand on the bottom.

The smart speaker design kind of looks like a bedpan (sorry not sorry). Image: Comcast via USPTO

At first glance I’d say this device looks more like a router (minus the antennas) than a smart speaker something I suppose makes sense for a company that specializes in connectivity. But after one of my colleagues said it looked like a bedpan I just couldn’t unsee the resemblance.

The funny thing is that Comcast was reportedly looking into making some sort of health-focused speaker that tracked your bathroom habits in 2019. Although it never made it into the hands (or bathrooms) of consumers it was supposed to come with sensors that tracked how often someone got up to use the bathroom and how long they stayed in there. At the time Comcast made sure to emphasize that it was not a smart speaker. It’s not entirely clear if these two devices are somehow related and Comcast didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1jYWxsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzI4L3RlbGwtdXMteW91ci1zdG9yeS1hZnRlci01My15ZWFycy1yYXktZGlkaW5nZXItcmV0aXJlcy1mcm9tLWEtY2FyZWVyLXRoYXRzLWhhcmQtdG8tbWF0Y2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 53 years Ray Didinger retires from a career that's hard to match,Tell us your story: After 53 years Ray Didinger retires from a career that’s hard to match,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMjkvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvcGFyYW1vdW50LXN0cmVhbWluZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Paramount Compete With Netflix and Disney?,"In January the board of Paramount including Shari Redstone the company’s chair met with a group of bankers to get an update on the media industry and to hear about potential deals that might help the company better compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Disney.

Over the years the mall would sometimes run out in the weeks before Christmas fill in with gift cards and quickly reorder from its custom coin maker. As one Dallas shopper said on a Facebook post “There is something about having a pocket filled w(ith) gold to spend” that makes the “experience at NorthPark magical.”

The shopping center said on its website that it has temporarily suspended the sale of the coins “due to the inability of NorthPark’s banking partner Comerica Bank NorthPark branch to handle the gift coin transactions going forward.”

Stores and restaurants will accept the coins until July 10. Holders can also exchange the coins for gift cards at the concierge desk near Neiman Marcus the mall said.

Until NorthPark finds a new system for the physical coins the mall said its concierge will sell the NorthPark Gold Gift Card issued by American Express which is also redeemable at the mall’s more than 200 retailers and restaurants.

“We apologize for any inconvenience and hope to continue the NorthPark Gold Gift Coin program in the future” the mall said.

The mall added in an email: “We are exploring the possibility of continuing the program with another bank.”

""When you're ahead in the count you're almost 100% certain that you're going to win the battle"" Rodríguez said Saturday. ""It's important.""

Rodríguez who turned 24 at the end of March made his MLB debut April 10 out of the bullpen but he was optioned soon after to Triple-A Toledo to build up his stamina as a starting pitcher.

The Tigers due to a slew of injuries added Rodríguez to their rotation Monday to face the Minnesota Twins at Target Field. He's slated to make his second start Sunday against the Cleveland Guardians at Comerica Park.

""I'm preparing myself both physically and mentally"" Rodríguez said.

Against the Twins Rodríguez allowed four runs on four hits and three walks with four strikeouts in five innings. All four runs scored on a first-inning grand slam; Rodríguez then cruised through the second third fourth and fifth frames.

He threw 43 of 75 pitches for strikes good for a 57.3% strike rate. He used his fastball slider changeup and curveball logging six swings and misses: one on his fastball two on sliders and three on changeups.

""He's likely to get a couple starts during the time where our rotation is being re-shifted"" manager A.J. Hinch said last week before Rodríguez's first start. ""We'd like to see strikes and would like to see him get into the fifth sixth seventh innings with the lead. He's got pitches to do it.""

Rodríguez before joining the Tigers posted a 3.57 ERA with 13 walks and 21 strikeouts over 22⅔ innings in six games (five starts) for the Mud Hens. He pitched 18 of 19 games last season for Double-A Erie.

""It's not a big difference between here and Triple-A"" Rodríguez said. ""Up here they make adjustments quicker and that might be the only difference. But down there and up here they all make adjustments. It's basically the same game.""

The Tigers have six starting pitchers on the injured list: Tyler Alexander (left elbow sprain) Matt Manning (right biceps tendinitis) Casey Mize (right elbow sprain) Michael Pineda (right middle finger fracture) Eduardo Rodriguez (left ribcage sprain) and Spencer Turnbull (Tommy John surgery).

Alexander is the closest to returning. He starts Monday for Toledo beginning his rehab assignment. Once Alexander returns Rodríguez or Rony García could get bounced from the rotation.

Rodríguez plans to make sure he gets to stick around.

""My focus is on working hard and helping my team win and showing and proving that I can be a starter here"" Rodríguez said. ""But basically my main goal is to help this team win and open their eyes so they can see what I'm capable of doing.""

Tuesday's doubleheader

Because of Friday's postponement the Tigers pushed their entire rotation back one day: Alex Faedo starts Saturday followed by Rodríguez on Sunday Beau Brieske on Monday and García for the first game of Tuesday's doubleheader.

MORE INJURY UPDATES: Casey Mize eyes throwing program; Austin Meadows reports to Lakeland

For the second game Tuesday right-hander Joey Wentz will make his second MLB start. The 24-year-old currently with Toledo is lined up to join the Tigers as the 27th player.

Wentz appeared in his MLB debut starting part of a May 11 doubleheader against the Oakland Athletics. He allowed six runs on seven hits and two walks with one strikeout in 2⅔ innings throwing 41 of 73 pitches for strikes.

Tarik Skubal will start Wednesday.

Willi Castro and his old friends

Before Friday's rainout Tigers left fielder Will Castro spent time chatting with some of his old teammates.

He signed with the Guardians as an amateur free agent in July 2013 and stayed in Cleveland's organization until July 2018 when he was traded to the Tigers for Leonys Martin. He made his MLB debut in August 2019.

TAKEAWAYS FROM MINNEAPOLIS: Tigers reliever Alex Lange has a sudden serenity on the mound. Here's his secret

Castro 25 is friends with Guardians pitchers Shane Bieber Triston McKenzie and Zach Plesac. He also knows Óscar González who made his MLB debut in Thursday's series opener and finished 2-for-4 with a double.

""I played with them in the minor leagues"" Castro said.

Saturday Bieber starts against the Tigers.

Castro is 2-for-14 (.143) in his MLB career against Bieber tossing in one home run three RBIs one walk and seven strikeouts across 15 plate appearances. They played together for High-A Lynchburg in 2017.

""I never got to face him in a live BP or anything but I know he has some good pitches"" Castro said. ""Once I got traded that's when I had the opportunity to go against him. I've seen him a lot so I just got to go out there and battle and know the pitches that he's going to throw.""

Castro is hitting .269 with three doubles one home run four RBIs five walks and 14 strikeouts in 27 games. His strikeout rate has improved from 24.2% last season to 16.5% this season.

""I feel really good"" Castro said. ""You go through some ups and downs sometimes. That's part of baseball. I feel really good and really prepared. It's just about going out there and winning some games.""

An inflation gauge closely tracked by the Federal Reserve rose 6.3% in April from a year earlier the first slowdown since November 2020 and a sign that high prices may finally be moderating at least for now.

The inflation figure the Commerce Department reported Friday was below the four-decade high of 6.6% set in March. While high inflation is still causing hardships for millions of households any slowing of price increases if sustained would provide some modest relief.

The report also showed that consumer spending rose at a healthy 0.9% annual rate from March to April outpacing the month-to-month inflation rate for a fourth straight time. The ongoing willingness of the nation’s consumers to keep spending freely despite inflated prices is helping sustain the economy. Yet all that spending is helping keep prices high and could make the Federal Reserve’s goal of taming inflation even harder.

“Inflation is finally slowing but it’s a little early for high-fives” said Bill Adams chief economist at Comerica Bank.

Adams noted that gas and food prices have risen in May and that Russia’s war against Ukraine and COVID-19-related lockdowns in China could further disrupt supply shortages and send prices accelerating again.

Consumers’ resilience in the face of sharply higher prices suggests that economic growth is rebounding in the current April-June quarter. The economy shrank at a 1.5% annual rate in the first quarter mostly because of an increase in the trade deficit. But analysts now project that on an annual basis it’s growing as much as 3% in the current quarter.

Americans have been able to keep spending despite higher inflation because of rising wages a stockpile of savings built up during the pandemic and a rebound in credit card use. Economists say those factors could bolster spending and support the economy for much of this year.

Incomes rose 0.4% from March to April Friday’s report showed slightly faster than inflation. Still high inflation is forcing consumers on average to save less. The savings rate fell to 4.4% last month the lowest level since 2008. Overall though Americans have built up an additional $2.5 trillion in savings since the pandemic and economists calculate that pile is eroding only slowly.

Friday’s report showed that on a month-to-month basis prices rose 0.2% from March to April down from the 0.9% increase from February to March. The April increase was the smallest since November 2020.

Excluding the volatile food and energy categories so-called core prices rose 0.3% from March to April matching the previous month’s rise. Core prices climbed 4.9% from a year earlier the first such drop since October 2020.

Still inflation remains painfully high and it’s inflicting a heavy burden in particular on lower-income households many of them Black or Hispanic. Surging demand for furniture appliances and other goods combined with supply chain snarls began sending prices surging about a year ago.

Consumers have shifted some of their spending from goods to services like airline fares and entertainment tickets. That trend could help cool inflation in the months ahead though it’s unclear by how much.

Goods prices which were the major drivers of inflation last year fell 0.2% from March to April after having jumped the previous month. Used car prices dropped 2.3% in April though they’re still much more expensive than a year ago. The cost of clothing appliances and computers also declined.

And retailers like Target have reported rising stockpiles of televisions patio furniture and other goods for the home as consumers have shifted their spending more toward travel and services-related goods like luggage and restaurant gift cards.

Those stores will likely have to offer discounts to clear inventory in the coming months. And auto manufacturers have been ramping up production as some supply chain snarls untangle and as they have managed to hire more workers. Both trends could keep reducing the cost of manufactured items.

Yet the cost of such services as restaurant meals plane tickets and hotel rooms is still rising offsetting much of the relief from cheaper goods. And the rising prices of gas and food worsened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will keep measures of inflation painfully high at least into the summer. The national average price of a gallon of gas has reached $4.60 according to AAA. A year ago it was $3.04.

Chair Jerome Powell has pledged to keep ratcheting up the Fed’s key short-term interest rate until inflation is “coming down in a clear and convincing way.” Those rate hikes have spurred fears that the Fed in its drive to slow borrowing and spending may push the economy into a recession. That concern has caused sharp drops in stock prices in the past two months though markets have rallied this week.

Powell has signaled that the Fed will likely raise its benchmark rate by a half-point in both June and July — twice the size of the usual rate increase.

Most economists have forecast that inflation as measured by the Fed’s preferred gauge will still be at about 4% or higher by the end of this year. Price increases at that level would likely mean that the Fed will still raise interest rates to lower inflation to its 2% target.

A better-known inflation gauge the consumer price index earlier this month also reported a slowing in price gains. The CPI jumped 8.3% in April from a year earlier down from a 40-year high in March of 8.5%.

The inflation measure reported Friday called the personal consumption expenditures price index differs in several ways from the consumer price index that help explain why it shows a lower inflation level than the CPI does.

The PCE is a broader measure of inflation that includes payments made on behalf of consumers such as medical services covered by insurance or government programs. The CPI covers only out-of-pocket costs which in recent years have risen more. Rents which are steadily rising are also given less weight in the PCE than in the CPI.

The PCE price index also seeks to account for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps. As a result it can capture for example when consumers switch from pricey national brands to cheaper store brands."

Paraíso Chirriante.- Cuando hablamos de inventores mexicanos se nos viene a la mente el nombre de Guillermo González Camarena y nos duele el estómago por saber lo que pasó. Sin embargo hay otro genio mexicano que registró más de 150 patentes durante su vida incluyendo la máquina para hacer tortillas sin la cual no podríamos vivir.

Su nombre es Fausto Celorio y a él le debemos todo el sistema actual de venta de tortillas que se hacen con las clásicas máquinas que amoldan la masa las van pasando por rodillos para calentarlas hasta que nos las entregan listas para ponerle poquita sal hacerla rollito y degustarla.

¿Te mandaban a las tortillas? El sonido tan característico de estos lugares proviene de la innovación de este mexicano. https://t.co/K8GSdUnR3F — Talent Republic (@talentrepublic_) May 26 2022

Antes del invento de don Fausto la única manera de hacer tortillas era amasando la masa (después de bajarse pa’ abajo) y hechas a manos con metate y comal que si bien son una delicia su proceso de elaboración era mucho más caro y tardado por no decir doloroso para la espalda…

Este inventor sí se puede ver

El invento de Celorio llegó en 1947 cuando implementó un sistema de rodillos para troquelar y transportar la tortilla. La máquina permitía aplastar la masa laminada y cortada para tomar la clásica forma de disco. Después la tortilla es transportada en una banda a tres hornos para finalmente salir.

Eso después de que se realiza el proceso de nixtamalización que consiste en mezclar el maíz con cal viva y agua. Esa mezcla es llevaba a la molienda (parte del invento del “Edison mexicano”) donde se producen las tortillas.

Si bien en 1904 dos mexicanos de nombres Everardo Rodríguez y Luis Romero ya habían ideado un aparato que produjera tortillas de forma masiva este no tenía la industrialización que el de Fausto y curiosamente producía tortillas cuadradas que no fueron bien recibidas por la población de ese entonces (y seguramente tampoco ahorita).

En 1904 a Everardo Rodríguez se le ocurrió crear la primera máquina de hacer tortillas y así acelerar el proceso de producción pero eran tortillas cuadradas fue hasta 1947 cuando Fausto Celorio creo la máquina que por fin hacia las tortillas redondas como era la costumbre. pic.twitter.com/RioO0v9EYU — Angélica Tovar 💣 (@Angeliketm6) October 23 2021

El invento de este mexicano fue perfeccionado por el mismo Celorio en 1995 creando una máquina más pequeña capaz de producir 131 kg de tortilla por hora que tenía encendido eléctrico. Hasta el día de hoy se han vendido más de 100 millones de estos aparatos para crear tortillas en todo el mundo por si creían que solo hay que hablar del éxito del Checo Pérez.

¿Por qué nadie ha mejorado este invento para que no haga ruidos como película de terror? Es algo para lo que no tenemos respuesta…

The driver-side rear door is caved in its driver’s door is a bit beat up and it’s missing its front fenders along with its front bumper. Tragically even its carbon fiber hood is useless as they’re a big crank in the front driver’s side.

Inside the M5 CS is missing its front carbon fiber sport seats as well as the rear bench seat. Which means you can’t buy the killer seats for your BMW 540i. I know you were thinking about it. One of the rear interior door panels is missing too.

It’s unclear what sort of damage was done under the skin though there’s likely some suspension and chassis damage. If so this M5 CS is probably toast. If there isn’t any major chassis damage it’s possible this car could be bought and repaired keeping this 1-of-1000 model on the road. Though without its CS-specific interior and carbon fiber hood in need of replacement this isn’t going to be a cheap fix.

The likeliest scenario is that this car gets picked apart by part-seeking vultures until there’s nothing left. There are still some CS-specific things you can get off this car such as the interior trim steering wheel gold wheels (if the driver’s side front wheel isn’t bent) and potentially some suspension components. The engine could be pulled to but it’s probably not worth the extra cost considering it’s barely different than the standard M5 engine. It’s a bit more powerful than a regular M5 but the mildest of engine tunes to a standard M5 will make it more powerful than an M5 CS.

If you want a few M5 CS-specific parts you might be able to salvage some off of this crashed car. But it might not be the right car to get if you’re looking to get a banged up M5 CS for cheap so you can fix it.

A two-bouncer through the infield off the bat of Molly Wolf provided the deciding runs as the Blue Raiders captured the Section 4 Class AA softball championship with a 7-5 win at the BAGSAI Complex in Binghamton.

Horseheads earned its second sectional title since 2009 and first since beating Corning four years ago. The Hawks had the upper hand in big games against the Blue Raiders since then including last year's sectional final.

""We were so excited to play them again and just knew it was our turn"" said Horseheads' Olivia Packard who followed Molly Wolf's homer with one of her own to bring the Blue Raiders within 5-4 in the sixth inning.

Said Wolf: ""They're a great team. It's a hard-earned win for us and we're really proud of what we did.""

Stars of the game

Winning pitcher Megan Wolf delivered the biggest home run leading off the seventh with a shot beyond the fence in center field to tie the score 5-5.

Wolf a freshman went the distance on the mound against a Corning lineup filled with future Division I college talent and allowed five runs on eight hits striking out eight and walking five.

Molly Wolf her sister went 2-for-3 with three RBIs. Packard was also 2-for-3 and Rachel Lunger smacked a two-out two-run double in the fourth inning to get the Raiders within 3-2.

Ellie DeRosa was 2-for-3 with a homer for two-time defending sectional champ Corning (18-2). Kellie Zoerb tripled doubled and drove in a run. Atalyia Rijo a University of Arkansas commit closed one of the top prep careers in Section 4 history with a double and an RBI.

""She's a great player. To know we can compete with her is a really good feeling"" Molly Wolf said of Rijo.

Rivalry rematch goes Horseheads' way

Corning was a 10-9 winner over Horseheads in the 2021 sectional final and beat the Raiders twice this season: 9-6 in 11 innings on Kelsey Booker's walk-off homer and 8-3.

Packard said the extra-inning loss gave Horseheads confidence it could beat Corning which is ranked third in the state in Class AA and was technically defending state champion since this year's state tournament will be the first since the Hawks won it all in 2019.

""We’ve had some battles with them the last two years"" Horseheads coach Rick Gryska said. ""It’s been up-down up-down. We had an extra-inning game there last year and then we lost on a walk-off this year.

""We know that’s a very talented team. They deserve to be ranked third in the state with that lineup they have. But I’ve been telling these girls all along we can beat them I know we can. If we just outhit them. Fortunately we did today.""

Huge seventh inning for Raiders freshman

Megan Wolf fell into an 0-2 hole to start her at-bat in the seventh before working back to 3-2. She then swatted a home run and exuberantly rounded the bases adding shortly after the game she didn't really remember the home run trot.

""That felt so good"" she said. ""We tied it the worst we could do is go play the seventh and we did it.""

DeRosa a George Mason commit led off the bottom of the seventh with a single and Booker followed with a walk. Out came Gryska for a chat that served a dual purpose. He told the outfielders to prioritize keeping the runner at first from getting the extra base on a hit rather than worry about a play at the plate. It also settled the moment.

""It definitely gave us all a chance to calm down and take a deep breath and just let ourselves get a little simmered down"" Packard said. ""We were at like an 11 we needed to be at a six.""

But he didn't say a word to Megan Wolf who said she focused on trying to get ground balls and had faith in her defense. She induced a pop-up for the first out and struck out the next batter. Gabby Beschler then fielded a grounder at third and forced out DeRosa to end the game.

Gryska told Megan after the game he was sticking with her no matter what.

""It feels great knowing my coach believes in me and knows that I can do it"" she said. ""Being a freshman that’s something I really enjoy.""

Day of clutch hits for Raiders

After Megan Wolf tied the score in the seventh Horseheads loaded the bases with one out following a single by Beschler a walk to Maddie Matkosky and a single by Eva Koratsis to center fielder DeRosa who threw a laser home as Gryska held pinch-runner Katie Morse at third.

Molly Wolf followed with a bouncer off reliever Jillian Austin that went between Rijo at shortstop and second baseman Olivia Keegan driving in two.

""They have an amazing infield and knowing that ball got through to score two runs just felt so good"" Wolf said.

Packard followed with a single but DeRosa threw out pinch-runner Kristen Cole at home.

An inning earlier Molly Wolf and Packard hit back-to-back solo shots to get Horseheads within 5-4.

""Once I hit it I knew she would build off me and she did"" Wolf said. ""She hit a bomb. That's still going.""

Said Packard: ""We play travel together and we’re always next to each other in the lineup and I feel like we really feed off each other’s momentum.""

Gryska didn't want his players cheated on swings Saturday.

""We did a lot of talking this week about not taking passive swings"" he said. ""Taking aggressive swings especially when you’re ahead in the count 1-0 2-1 those kinds of situations. … We did not hit any balls opposite field off of tees this week because I wanted them to be out in front and aggressive on the pitch. And I think that paid off.""

Quotable

""I sent them a message last night and told them they deserve this"" Gryska said. ""They deserve it because they’re good people they work hard they’re good students in school they’re just an all-around fun group they’re great teammates to each other. They deserve to win and they did it.""

Up next

Horseheads (11-7) will play the winner of the sub-regional between the champions from Section 9 and Section 1 in a state quarterfinal June 4 at Lakeland High School in Westchester County.

Sometimes that's frustrating if your favorite item goes away but it's exciting if it makes a return. Fortunately Costco does eventually bring back a lot of favorites especially when they line up with the seasons.

Just in time for summer the chain is bringing back a few warm-weather faves that members are already raving about. While they're not always seen at every warehouse they might be at yours. Here's what to keep an eye out for.

These Are Costco's Most Popular Items Right Now

Cotton Candy Grapes

Cotton Candy Grapes come and go with the seasons and the good news is that right now is their time to shine. These fruits are exactly what they sound like — grapes that taste like you're at a country fair! When you first bite into one you get the immediate taste of sweet cotton candy. After you eat a few the flavor seems to fade back to just your standard grape flavor but they're delicious all the same!6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Rainier Cherries

Another return for the season is Rainier Cherries. Costco members on Reddit have started spotting these in the produce sections of their local stores though they've noted that the California cherries that became available first aren't quite as tasty as the Washington cherries that came after.

Snickerdoodle Mini Cakes

You'll find the Snickerdoodle Mini Cakes back in stock at many Costco warehouses in the bakery section. These tasty cinnamon cakes are topped with a spiced cream cheese frosting and it's super hard to eat just one. These were on bakery shelves last fall but disappeared just as fast as they came. They've been spotted at a handful of warehouses around the country and your local one might just be a lucky winner.

Sushi

If you're someone who loves to grab dinner while you're grocery shopping Costco makes that easy. Included in your options at many warehouses in the U.S. now are fresh sushi rolls. Shoppers have been spotting sushi rolls in their local warehouses for a reasonable price (under $10!). This is a find that isn't always around so if you're lucky enough to find the fresh meal at your local store you should probably grab it.

Melona Ice Cream Bars

There are frozen fruit bars and there are ice cream bars…and then there are Melona Ice Cream Bars that are a little bit of both. These refreshing frozen treats have been seen back in Costco freezers just in time for the summer months. Stock up to kick off the summer right now and don't be shy about grabbing another box or two before they leave shelves again in a few months.

Cell phones Nest cams dash cams drones. There really isn't much that happens today that isn't saved for future generations to see as a part of history.

There are so many moments and events that happened during my childhood that I would love to see again on video but most of that history was captured by news crews as home video cameras in the 80s were just becoming a thing. They were super expensive and very bulky so you couldn't just always have a camera at the ready in your pocket.

I have always been a railroad fan ever since I was a kid so I was very surprised to see a post on Reddit of a video from the mid-80s showing the scene of a railroad derailment that happened during a strike on what was then Guilford Transportation and today is Pan Am Railways.

While the union members were striking strikebreakers better known as ""scabs"" were doing the work to re-rail the locomotives. The video has some very adult language as the scabs are confronted by the striking workers all using thick Maine accents.

Reddit user carhelpplz69 explained the reason for the strike at the time:

Today Guilford Transportation is Pan Am Railways but soon it will be no more. CSX has purchased the railroad that runs throughout most of Maine and other parts of New England and will take control on June 1. So soon instead of seeing blue Pan Am and black Guildford Transportation locomotives when you're stopped at a railroad crossing you'll see the blue and gold of CSX.

Levett who along with is wife Marabeth Ice Levett graduated from Hanover in 1971 is only the 11th person to serve the college’s board for 40 or more years and the first since 1980. He was an instrumental member of the board’s long-range steering committee during the 1990s and was elected vice-chairman in 1998.

“Hanover College has benefited immeasurably from the steady hand of Mark Levett for four decades” said President Lake Lambert. “During that time Hanover has experienced numerous changes and faced many challenges. Mark served and led the board with passion commitment and integrity. We are forever grateful for his service.”

Levett’s effort and influence have helped propel Hanover through three of the most successful fundraising efforts in school history. Partnering with his wife the couple’s leadership stewardship and philanthropy have had a profound impact on all corners of Hanover’s campus life the college said.

The Levetts served as co-chairs of the “Live Our Loyalty” campaign which raised more than $55 million from 2010-13 and were influential in guiding “The Campaign for Hanover” a five-year $60 million effort completed in 1995. Recently the couple has provided leadership in the successful first phase of the college’s bicentennial campaign which has raised more than $27 million in the past three years.

In 2017 their generosity established the Levett Career Development Center. Their namesake provides the home for Hanover’s business and entrepreneurship faculty and serves as a one-stop campus location for all students seeking career counseling internships or interview preparation.

“When I first joined the board I had no idea I would serve for more than 40 years. It’s been an honor and a privilege to serve alongside so many incredible people” noted Levett. “As I reflect on my time on the board and as board chair the credit for my longevity goes to my fellow board members and the administration who provided ongoing support and inspiration. Hanover College is an amazing institution and I look forward to witnessing and supporting many future successes.”

Levett served Cummins Inc. for 42 years. He joined the company as an analyst in 1973 when Cummins was a $500 million North American company. He held seven officer positions including vice president international and general manager and vice president-high horsepower business playing a key leadership role in Cummins’ growth to more than $20 billion in revenue and more than 50 percent of operations and sales being from outside the U.S.

He retired in 2015 as chief executive officer of the Cummins Foundation with a focus on increasing Cummins’ corporate responsibility globally.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wcmVzc29mYXRsYW50aWNjaXR5L25hbWUvYW1hbmRhLWN1bW1pbnMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQ5NDY0MjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amanda Cummins Obituary (1976 - 2022) - Micco FL - The Press of Atlantic City,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pressofatlanticcity/name/amanda-cummins-obituary?id=34946424 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wcmVzc29mYXRsYW50aWNjaXR5L25hbWUvYW1hbmRhLWN1bW1pbnMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQ5NDY0MjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvd2hlbi1jYWxscy10aGUtaGVhcnQtNC1iaWctcXVlc3Rpb25zLXNlYXNvbi05LWZpbmFsZS5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'When Calls the Heart': 4 Big Questions We Have After the Season 9 Finale,"The 'When Calls the Heart' Season 9 finale left us with some big questions about what's next for Nathan Henry and BIll.

Hallmark has left Hearties hanging. As fans wait to learn whether When Calls the Heart will be renewed for Season 10 they’re left to ponder some storylines that were left unresolved in the show’s season 9 finale from whether a long-time Hope Valley resident is going to prison to the cause of a fire that destroyed a town landmark. Here are four of the biggest questions we have after watching ‘Rock A Bye Baby.’

[Warning: This article contains spoilers for When Calls the Heart Season 9.]

Will Henry Gowen go to prison?

Martin Cummins in ‘When Calls the Heart’ Season 9 | ©2022 Crown Media United States LLC/Photographer: Eike Schroter

Henry Gowen (Martin Cummins) has come a long way since season 1. The businessman has come to blame himself for the mine explosion that occured on his watch and which killed so many men. So when he realized that selling his shares of the oil business was likely to lead to the reopening of the mine he decided to take drastic action. He set an explosion that caused a cave-in and rendered the mine unusable at least temporarily.

Bill (Jack Wagner) ordered Henry to get out of town because Smith and the other investors weren’t going to let his crime go unpunished. But in the season finale Henry rolled back into Hope Valley in a prison wagon having turned himself into the authorities. As Henry sat in the Hope Valley jail Bill told him he’d do what he could to keep him out of prison but his options were limited.

Henry seems at peace with his possible fate perhaps because he believes it’s a way to atone for his role in the deaths of dozens of men. But will he actually end up being convicted? Bill is a good lawyer but given his health problems (more on that below) will he be able to mount the kind of strong defense Henry needs to stay out of prison?

Is Bill Avery going to be OK (and what’s up with him and Molly)?

We’ll have grape juice ? with Uncle Bill anytime! Right LJ? ? pic.twitter.com/jG21W9jUBX — Hallmark Channel (@hallmarkchannel) May 23 2022

Bill spent much of When Calls the Heart Season 9 ignoring a nagging cough – and the persistent pleas from Molly (Johannah Newmarch) and Faith (Andrea Brooks) to get a chest X-ray that could diagnose the problem. Eventually Bill gave in and the news wasn’t good. While he didn’t explicitly say that he had cancer he told Elizabeth (Erin Krakow) that he’d be spending time in Union City for treatment. Another ominous sign? He was getting his affairs in order including updating his will.

Bill told Elizabeth that she didn’t need to worry and that he was just doing some commonsense estate planning. But it seems there’s a good chance that his health problems are more serious than he’s letting on raising fan fears about the character’s future on the show.

If there’s a silver lining to Bill’s illness it’s that it may have pushed him and Molly to be more honest about their feelings for each other. They’ve had a flirtatious relationship for a while but so far neither has made a move. But Molly ended up accompanying him to his doctor’s appointment in Union City. We didn’t see what happened while they were out of town but Molly had some big news to share with Faith when she returned. Could she and Bill have finally opened up to each other about their true feelings now that he’s facing his own mortality?

Are Nathan and Mei an item?

Mei @amndawong returned to Hope Valley but Faith @AndreaKBrooks confessed that she has feelings for Nathan @kevin_mcGarry #Hearties what do you think is going to happen next? ❤️ pic.twitter.com/jgGI6ulaZh — Hallmark Channel (@hallmarkchannel) May 23 2022

Nathan (Kevin McGarry) started out season 9 still nursing a broken heart after Elizabeth’s rejection of him. But he perked up when Mei Sou (Amanda Wong) arrived in town to take a job at the new pharmacy. The two seemed to have eyes for each other but complications involving a man who claimed to be Mei’s husband put any chance at romance on hold especially when she had to return to Chicago to deal with the issue.

Mei returned to Hope Valley in the season 9 finale. That seems to set the stage for a romance between her and Nathan in a potential season 10. But there’s another woman who’s also interested in the Mountie. Faith confessed to Molly that she’d developed feelings for Nathan. However she didn’t feel she could act on them because he was her patient. When Mei returned she insisted she was relieved as it mean Mei and Nathan could pursue a relationship. But where does Nathan’s heart lie? It’s hard to discount that charged moment Nathan and Faith shared in the surgery.

In an interview with ET When Calls the Heart co-executive producer and writer Elizabeth Stewart declined to confirm that Mei and Nathan were now a couple. “​​I don’t think it’s safe to assume anything when it comes to love and relationships especially in Hope Valley!” she said.

Who (or what) started the saloon fire?

Finally the When Calls the Heart Season 9 finale featured a massive fire at the Queen of Hearts saloon. While no one was seriously hurt in the blaze it appeared to have completely destroyed the building. But what caused the fire is a mystery. It could have been a tragic accident. But there’s a chance it had a more sinister cause. Lucas’s (Chris McNally) dealings with Wyman Walden (Wesley Salter) seemed to be behind him now that the shady businessman is behind bars. But could one of his associates have targeted the saloon as an act of revenge?

Whatever the cause the saloon fire leaves Lucas in an interesting position professionally speaking. He’s already sold his shares in the oil company and now his other business has been destroyed. He and Elizabeth are engaged but he’ll need to find some other career soon both to occupy his time and support his new family.

The Cannes comparisons even stretched to the weather with the West Cork hotspot bathed in sunshine as the film festival without a cinema screened dozens of short films and hosted numerous workshops and public events.

Film producer David Puttnam actors such as Stephen Rea Pauline McLynn and Ciarán Hinds as well as celebrated film-score creator Stephen Warbeck were among those who strolled the busy mainstreet in Schull at the weekend.

Highlights included a discussion between Normal People star Paul Mescal and the director of the series Lenny Abrahamson. They revealed it was the first time they’d actually talked properly about the show as a combination of the pandemic and their own busy schedules had kept them apart since the adaptation of the Sally Rooney novel hit phenomenal success in 2020.

Sipping on pints as they reminisced – stout for Abrahamson beer for Mescal – for the audience it really felt like they were eavesdropping on some sort of friendly pub conversation. Mescal almost became emotional watching back one of the many incredible scenes he shared with co-star Daisy Edgar-Jones on the series.

The former Connell became an overnight star from Normal People – he’s in two films showing in Cannes at the moment – but seems to be dealing fine with his new-found fame.

“It’s definitely been an adjustment but not necessarily in a bad way” said the 26-year-old who revealed that switching off his social media has helped him cope. “The pandemic was also a help. As Normal People was taking off I was shielded from it all a bit by the fact that I was just locked down with my flatmates in London. It did get a bit mad when I’d pop over to the shop and next thing there’d be paparazzi picture appear of me buying a sausage roll!”

While Normal People was met with universal acclaim opinions on the recent Rooney adaptation Conversations With Friends has been more mixed.

“It was something we kind of expected” said Abrahamson co-director on both shows. “It’s its own thing and was never going to be Normal People 2.0. I’m still 100% proud of what we’ve done with it.”

The first Rooney adaptation gave Mescal to the world while the breakout star of the new series looks set to be Cork actress Alison Oliver. The Ballintemple newcomer joined Joe Alwyn (Nick in the show) for a discussion that included an explanation of how ‘intimacy co-ordinators’ have become such an important job on film and TV sets.

The audience heard how before any sex scenes take place everything is carefully worked out so all the actors are comfortable in the situation. For filming the crew is reduced to a minimum and on Abrahamson’s sets at least a good gender balance is an important part of the process.

“Even knowing that a conscious decision has been made about all this was great” said Oliver 23. “We knew we were in safe hands.”

Incidentally the audience at the Oliver-Alwyn event had been asked to keep their questions focused on the show a strong hint not to ask the English actor about his girlfriend Taylor Swift.

And for all the international star power in the village the biggest event of the weekend had Schull honouring one of its own. Fergus O'Farrell is the subject of a documentary entitled Breaking Out which was screened on Sunday evening in the local park followed by a gig from the late singer's band Interference and various special guests.

Federal health officials have reopened a government website that processes orders of rapid at-home COVID tests delivered free of charge.

Households within the United States can now order eight additional test kits for free at COVIDTests.gov .

. Those who have already redeemed the offer for free testing kits delivered to a single address may seek additional free at-home test kits at certain federal testing centers.

For those with private insurance Medicare or Medicaid insurance providers are increasingly required to reimburse you at least $12 per test (if not more) up to eight times per month.

Learn more on the rules of how to get reimbursed for at-home COVID-19 test fees below.

Americans can now order a third round of free COVID-19 test kits to be used at home free of charge through a federal health site that's been established at COVIDTests.gov by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Fulfilled by U.S. Postal Service mail carriers eight free at-home COVID-19 test kits will be delivered to each U.S. household address with many orders shipping ahead of the first summer holidays.

Individuals will be asked to register for eight rapid antigen COVID-19 test kits via a USPS order portal after visiting the federal site — according to instructions shared on site orders will ship in separate packages. Americans will then receive two separate confirmation emails after filing their request with tracking information for two packages that contain four tests each.

White House officials announced the expansion of additional free tests in mid-May citing the spread of Omicron-fueled COVID-19 cases across the nation as a reason for Americans to continue to frequently monitor their health. More than 350 million free tests have been delivered to households as part of the federal health initiative ""with most tests delivered by the U.S. Postal Service within 48 hours of shipping"" officials said.

But if you're already claimed up to 16 free tests through USPS delivery there are still ways to receive free at-home COVID-19 testing kits through local Medicaid programs as well as your private insurance. Read more to learn how you can get free COVID-19 tests this summer.

How to order free at-home COVID-19 tests:

Simply visit COVIDTests.gov and select ""Order Free At-Home Tests"" on the site's homepage. From there you'll be directed to a USPS site where you'll share your contact information and desired shipping information. While health insurance information or further identification isn't required federal officials have limited COVID-19 test orders to one per household — if you lived in a shared residence be sure to indicate your apartment or unit number or your order may not be processed.

Shared-family households can currently only receive 8 test kits per order. HHS officials note on the website that packages usually require between seven to 12 days of processing before they're shipped out.

How to get free COVID-19 testing kits from pharmacies and other retailers:

Americans who are medically insured either purchased through the federal marketplace or through their employer may be eligible for free at-home COVID-19 tests at a local pharmacy or retailer — or at the very least can get fully or partially reimbursed for up to eight at-home tests per month.

According to materials published by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services insured individuals can request FDA-approved at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests for free if their selected insurance plan provides direct coverage. But even if your insurance doesn't cover the cost of an at-home testing kit upfront federal programs enable you to get fully reimbursed for the full cost of the test you've paid for.

And if your plan requires you to purchase a certain kind of test at a particular pharmacy for full benefits you're still entitled to a partial refund if you provide your receipt for proof of purchase.

""If your plan has set up a network of preferred providers at which you can obtain a test with no out-of-pocket expense you can still obtain tests from other retailers outside that network"" the HHS site reads. ""Insurance companies are required to reimburse you at a rate of up to $12 per individual test or the cost of the test itself if less than $12.""

But a majority of insurance plans have gone ahead and authorized free at-home test kits given a new insurance rule that allows individuals to ask for full refunds.

""If the plan or insurer doesn't set up a process through which individuals can obtain a test with no upfront costs then the plan and insurer must reimburse the full cost of the test even if the test costs more than $12"" HHS continues.

Pharmacies like CVS are also making it easier for customers to order at-home test kits using their medical insurance card directly. More often than not Americans can place an order for using their insurance plan information at ""zero upfront out-of-pocket cost and without the need to submit a claim to [your] health insurance provider"" a CVS Health representative tells Good Housekeeping.

The chain of pharmacies allows those with in-network plans to pick up their tests from any chosen store location using this method. Additionally some plans allow individuals to pay for at-home tests using their insurance card at a CVS pharmacy counter in store with no notice needed.

How to get free COVID-19 tests through Medicare or Medicaid:

While it's true that some test providers have blocked uninsured individuals from receiving free COVID-19 testing even those who may only have access to Medicare or Medicaid can find additional free at-home COVID-19 tests. The list of pharmacies that offer free at-home COVID-19 testing for those enrolled in Medicare are listed here; the same general limit applies with a cap of eight free tests each month.

For those with Medicaid the American Rescue Plan requires state programs to cover at-home COVID-19 tests for policyholders according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. ""People with Medicaid or CHIP coverage should contact their state Medicaid or CHIP agency for information regarding the specifics of coverage for at-home COVID-19 tests as coverage rules may vary by state"" HHS states on the same webpage.

Those with sole Medicare Part A plans and no supplementary coverage cannot pay for at-home test kits through the American Rescue Plan's provisions. But HHS and state health officials have established more than 10000 community-based pharmacy testing sites around the country where many at-home kits will be available to those in need as noted by the HHS' Health Resources and Services Administration.

If you're looking for free at-home test kits regardless of what kind of Medicare you may be subscribed to start by visiting one of the federally funded HHS testing sites near you. ""People without insurance can also get free at-home tests from some community health centers"" HHS officials noted.

Liverpool are adamant Sadio Mane will only be allowed to leave for a fee in excess of £25million providing they have a suitable replacement lined up after the forward was heavily linked with Bayern Munich.

The Bundesliga champions who themselves look likely to lose striker Robert Lewandowski this summer have yet to even make contact with the Reds about any potential deal.

But the day after their Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid reports have suggested the Senegal international wants to move to Germany before the end of his current contract which has 12 months remaining.

The PA news agency understands the 30-year-old has also not yet made his intentions clear to the club he joined from Southampton for £30m six years ago.

But having allowed his contract to tick down to the final 12 months the likelihood of signing a new one looks less likely despite him scoring 23 goals this season.

Mane had hinted on Wednesday he would announce a “special” decision on his long-term plans after the Champions League final with Real Madrid but after the 1-0 defeat at the Stade de France the forward did not make an appearance in front of the media.

Manager Jurgen Klopp was asked about the Bayern rumours at his pre-match press conference in Paris and his answer was rather non-committal.

“Wherever Sadio will play next year he will be a big player” said the Reds boss.

Here are the ways the country could deal with its ...,"Russia's oil export revenue soared 50% this year. Photo by Janos Kummer/Getty Images

Russian oil producers are having to rely on a diminishing list of buyers to sell their output.

Lockdowns in China have depressed crude demand while the EU is trying to ban imports of Russian oil.

An industry expert laid out three possible options Russia has to deal with the situation.

Russia may be reeling in billions in oil revenue thanks to sky-high crude prices that are the direct result of Western sanctions but its list of potential customers is shrinking and it's having to pin more and more of its hopes on top commodity importer China.

The US placed a full embargo on Russian energy imports while the UK will phase out its purchases of Russian fuel. The EU has banned imports of Russian coal but is still trying to get all member countries to agree to a ban on the country's crude and refined products.

The EU has been Russia's largest crude oil customer and accounted for about 3 million barrels per day of its roughly 7 million barrels a day in exports. But even before there was any talk of import bans traders were already shunning Russian oil.

Countries like India and China have stepped in to snap up Russia's oil at bargain prices but in far smaller volumes. India for instance has purchased at least 40 million barrels of Russian crude since it invaded Ukraine topping the amount it bought throughout 2021. But this is still only equal to around 450000 barrels per day.

China too has typically been a big customer. The country's independent oil refiners have been quietly buying cheap crude. But while China is taking large amounts of Russian oil lately its appetite isn't insatiable. Its traders are already importing 1 million barrels of seaborne Russian crude. And the country is still subject to a series of tough coronavirus lockdowns that have weighed on energy demand.

And even if demand from China fully recovers the two countries that would take in Russia's oil - India and China - would not make up for the loss of EU demand Fernando Ferreira a geopolitical risk analyst at Rapidan Energy Group told Insider.

""China and India alone are not going to come to the rescue"" he said.

Find new buyers

A short-term solution for Russia would be to find new markets. ""They will try to find new buyers"" Ferreira said. ""They shifted a lot of their customer base from Europe to Asia and they've managed to offset all disruptions so far by selling more to India and China.""

But several Middle East exporters produce similar grades of crude to Russia's flagship Urals grade and they have first-mover advantage he said.

India for instance has long-term trade agreements and commercial and strategic relationships with Gulf countries that they would want to maintain. ""That's going to limit how much oil they are going to take from Russia"" Ferreira said.

Story continues

Shipping constraints would hinder Russia's ability to move more oil to Asia he added as more shipowners and insurers avoid handling Russian oil as a result of tighter restrictions from the EU for starters.

Cut or store output

Another viable option for Russia would be to cut production or build more storage facilities.

Russia already started slashing crude production last month due to lower domestic demand.

The Kremlin stated that it sees output falling as much as 17% this year from around 11 million barrels per day.

""Some of that [demand] may recover somewhat this month. We're seeing refineries trying to offset the drop in production but in the long-term there is not a whole lot of sustainable solutions other than finding new buyers and they'll struggle with that"" Ferreira said.

""The best-case scenario is that India and China and other countries really just step up and absorb all of the disrupted Russian barrels he said.""

It would be more of a dislocation than a disruption he added.

""The worst-case scenario I think would be something along the lines of Chinese demand will recover and at the same time you're going to see growing pressure on imports from Russia"" Ferreira said.

The Russian government in April said it was considering building storage facilities for 700 million barrels of oil — equal to around 70 days of global consumption Reuters reported.

Ferreira said oil prices ""may be pretty close to the peak already."" But there's still a possibility of a shortfall of 2 million barrels of oil a day if Russia can't find new customers he said.

The April 22 episode “Fool’s Gold” found Atwater reaching out to Celeste one last time to make amends for what went down during their short-lived romance.

More from TVLine

As you’ll recall the pair met at a bar hooked up and began dating. Since Celeste was a social activist who was critical of police Atwater lied about his job and continued to see her while pretending to be a regular citizen. When she finally found out she was more hurt that he lied to her than him being a cop and their relationship ended. Celeste has been ignoring Atwater’s calls since then.

Chicago PD

In “Fool’s Gold” he left a final heartfelt apology on her voicemail and resolved to never bother her again. Given everything that happened so far LaRoyce Hawkins who plays Atwater says the Intelligence cop will surely learn from his mistakes.

“Atwater definitely needs love but he’s also not wanting to force anything. You can’t force a vibe. If it was meant to be it will be” he tells TVLine. “If [Celeste] has a hard time understanding his intentions behind why he couldn’t be as vulnerable with her as she probably would like for him to be he has to take that and keep growing from it… When we find Atwater in his next situation as we watch him play the field moving forward he’ll be a lot more vulnerable.”

So where does this leave them? Can we expect to see Celeste back on the show or are they done for good?

“It might be” Hawkins notes. “I can’t say whether we’ll see her again. I would love to see her again but I’m not sure. I’m looking forward to whatever happens.”

Regardless of what happens between them the actor says that “Celeste will always be a big part of Atwater. We’ll see her in the decisions that he makes moving forward. She’s going to have a hold on him a little bit.”

Two blue-chip companies John Deere and Anheuser-Busch LLC joined forces in a specialized program to help support U.S. farmers that have experienced hardship.

The kickoff for the program which includes new Busch Light “For the Farmer” cans with a John Deere look was a giant game of cornhole.

As for those cans? They’re available at participating retailers from May 16 –July 3 in 24 or 30 pack cans.

The Big Bend event involved a John Deere 8RX tractor and ground-posted slingshot used to catapult super-sized bean bags into an oversized cornhole board. The general public could reserve tickets to also play traditional cornhole socialize with their friends and for some enjoy an adult beverage. And more than 500 showed up for the fun.

The event also netted Farm Rescue $200000 for their work in supporting farmers in need.

“The ‘For the Farmers’ cans mark a legendary union of two iconic brands with a shared passion for supporting farmers and the great Heartlands of America” says Krystyn Stowe Head of Marketing Busch Family Brands at Anheuser-Busch.

Busch Light has partnered with Farm Rescue since 2019 and contributed more than $750000 in donations to date. Farm Rescue was founded in 2005 and has helped more than 850 families since its inception. The organization’s mission is to help farmers and ranchers who have experienced a major illness or natural disaster by providing the necessary equipment and volunteer labor to perform time-sensitive services.

Supporting a program

Funding supports Farm Rescue general operations including fuel and service for the organization’s equipment and vehicle fleet as well as food and lodging for its many volunteers. Livestock feeding assistance is also available to ranchers. Much of the nonprofit’s field equipment is donated by John Deere and support comes from local dealers.

Farm Rescue helps bring in the necessary equipment and a volunteer work force to plant hay or harvest the crop. The organization offers its services to farm and ranch families in North Dakota South Dakota Minnesota Montana Iowa Nebraska and Kansas.

“Farm Rescue is honored to be the beneficiary of this incredible joint effort between Busch Light and John Deere” says Bill Gross Founder & President of Farm Rescue. “Both companies have been incredible supporters of our mission and this latest partnership truly solidifies their commitment to American agriculture. Although farmers only represent one percent of the total population they have a big responsibility in feeding the world. With the money raised through this one-of-a-kind promotion Farm Rescue will be able to extend a helping hand to many more farm families in a crisis.”

“This collaboration presents an exciting valuable opportunity to celebrate farmers the agriculture industry as a whole and the important work of Farm Rescue” notes Jenny Ose Director of Marketing Agriculture and Turf John Deere. “Farm Rescue gives families a chance to continue their livelihood during a critical time of need by providing the necessary equipment and manpower to get the job done. John Deere is committed to ensuring all farmers have access to the vital resources they need to sustain their farms for generations to come.”

After four years at Duke Quinn Riley is moving up.

Riley on the heels of a successful senior season in 2021-22 and his recent graduation from Duke announced Saturday morning via a team release that he will turn professional. The Raleigh native is set to compete in two professional events with the first coming June 2-5 on the Korn Ferry Tour at the REX Hospital Open and the second his PGA Tour debut at the John Deere Classic scheduled for June 27-July 3.

""I'm extremely thankful for the opportunity I've gotten here"" Riley said in a video accompanying Saturday's release. ""I'll proudly represent Duke everywhere I go wherever golf takes me and I'm extremely appreciative for the opportunity that they've given me.""

In his first two professional events Riley will play under the sponsor's exemption. His debut at the REX Hospital Open will come in Raleigh but the John Deere Classic—won by former U.S. Open champion Lucas Glover in 2021—is set to take place at TPC Deere Run in Silvis Ill.

Riley who posted a 72.38 scoring average in 2021-22 took a step forward in his final season with the Blue Devils leading the way for a young core and picking up his first collegiate win in Duke's team victory at the Stitch Intercollegiate on his home course in Cary N.C.

“We had a lot of successes this season” Riley said. “For me I felt like I kind of started to see glimpses of how I envisioned playing golf in college.”

""Everyone in the Duke Golf program myself included is absolutely thrilled for Quinn to have earned opportunities to compete on the Korn Ferry Tour and the PGA Tour"" head coach Jamie Green said in the release. ""It was exciting for all of us to watch Quinn's hard work for four years pay off with a very strong senior year and especially strong final half of the spring semester.""

At a 2019 field day at Ewing Field Ill. Donnie Morris displayed the experimental no-till planter he designed and built in 1966 for no-till researcher George McKibben at the University of Illinois.

Editor’s Note: All of history contains conflicting stories and accounts of the first planter built specifically for no-till are no different. There was International Harvester’s failed production in the early 1950s and Allis-Chalmers (A-C) is accepted to have birthed the first successful no-till planter in 1966. History as the saying goes belongs to the winners.

But John Rosendahl a long-retired A-C Deutz Allis and AGCO service department employee contacted No-Till Farmer (NTF) to point out an inaccuracy that may have been promulgated even before NTF was founded in 1972.

“The 600 series planter frames were not originally designed with no-till in mind” he says. “The no-till coulters did not replace the spring teeth on the front bar until 1967.” For more on this story click here .

Rosendahl’s story opened another rabbit hole and another look into events in Dixon Springs Ill. which might be regarded as no-till’s “garden of Eden” as it influenced Kentucky’s Harry Young Jr.  and countless other pioneering no-tillers. This article tells the story of the mechanic who some think built the first “real” no-till planter. It’s told by Illinois Farmer Today’s Nat Williams with permission from the publication.

— Mike Lessiter President

IT WAS A RADICAL IDEA planting seeds directly into unworked soil — so radical no machine existed that did such a thing. So Donnie Morris made one.

Morris a mechanic and ag engineer at the Dixon Springs Agricultural Center (DSAC) watched first-hand as the late University of Illinois weed scientist George McKibben experimented with the no-till concept as early as the 1960s at the DSAC.

Morris cobbled together various parts to make what some believe to be the first dedicated no-till planter design in 1966.

McKibben had struggled to test the new cropping method while planting corn into standing fescue but was willing to try virtually any planting scheme. “He even planted corn with a screwdriver to find out if this would work” Morris says.

One challenge was providing enough downward pressure for seeds to penetrate unplowed soil and stubble. The breakthrough came with the creation of what Donnie Morris calls a cutter-packer wheel to use on the single-row planter.

“After trying some changes to conventional planters it was apparent that route wasn’t going to get us a good no-till planter” said Morris now 88 who still lives on the same southern Illinois farm where he grew up. “The problem was getting the seed in the ground. The lightweight planters designed for worked-up dirt wouldn’t penetrate sod. We decided we were going to have to start from scratch.”

Morris created a heavier press wheel but it still didn’t do the trick. The breakthrough he says came with the “all-winter-long” work in creating a cutter-packer wheel.

“It was nearly a foot in diameter” he said of the cutter-packer wheel. “I put a coulter blade on the side of it that was about 3 inches bigger than the wheel. I put it on a pivot that you could adjust the height of it in relation to the opener runner.

DOWNPRESSURE A CHALLENGE. The earliest work in experimental no-till planters was done at Illinois Dixon Springs Ag Center by Dr. George McKibben and his trusted mechanic Donnie Morris. Downpressure was a problem as you can see in an early 2-row planter. SOURCE: From Maverick to Mainstream: A History of No-Till Farming

“The idea was that it would cut a slice of soil about 2 inches to the side of the runner move it over and then close up the opening that the coulter and runner had made then press it down on top of the seed.”

The crew tried it in the spring of 1967 and found it did the job. The machine was then hauled to the plots at Ewing Field and other places where more researchers joined in on the no-till movement.

Planter Components

Many of the components of the planter were cast-off parts from conventional machines and donated leftover items from Petter Supply Co. in nearby Paducah Ky. The marine equipment manufacturer also provided weights used on anchors. Morris installed them on the planter to provide sufficient pressure to help push the seeds into the claypan soils of southern Illinois.

The original no-till machine was a 3-row planter providing researchers with a handier method of planting the small experimental plots at Dixon Springs and Ewing Field. Morris built three planters and still has one in his shed at home. He also built a single-row machine which was used largely for replacement parts.

Deere’s First Scoff at No-Till?

The university pitched the “Sod & Stubble Planter” to John Deere which rejected it on the grounds of no-till’s insect control challenges. Morris and McKibben had the chance to apply for a patent but didn’t pursue it.

DEERE DIDN’T BELIEVE. John Deere declined to pursue Morris’s planter citing concerns about insect control. It may have been the first time but certainly not the last that Deere scoffed at the no-till practice. Click to enlarge

Patents were later awarded for inventors with similar designs but Morris who spent his 35-year career at the DSAC has no regrets. Instead he is satisfied that he played a small role in helping alleviate one of the biggest problems facing agriculture at the time — soil erosion. “I was just thankful we got no-till going and saved a lot of acres” he says.

More on the University of Illinois’ Ewing Field Demonstration Center “There was actually pretty good ridicule for people who were trying no-till early on” said Dennis Epplin a former University of Illinois extension agronomist. “They said ‘That simply can’t work. You’re doomed to failure. And besides that you’re really making the neighborhood look ugly.’ Things have changed a great deal.” Dennis Thompson an extension educator who first became involved in research at Ewing in the mid-1970s added everything fell into place for a new way of farming. Some of the earliest users were farmers in Kentucky. “The time for no-till was right” Thompson said. “This demonstration center [at Ewing Field] was an excellent venue to support the work at Dixon Springs Ill. It took about 5 years for adoption of the practice to really begin. This was a tool for sloping land good drainage places where you wanted to avoid erosion. “After seeing that Kentucky was adopting it we learned the types of soils and slopes here where it would work. Now it is common not only in the Midwest but throughout the world.” Epplin said observation of the plot at Ewing Field provided researchers with some insight to the promise of no-till. “There were some challenges with both crop production and water drainage in southern Illinois” he said. “The no-till plot didn’t have those same challenges. It was clear that no-till was working pretty well. Also it could save a bunch of time.” — Nat Williams Illinois Farmer Today

The challenges came as officials from airlines to hotels to destinations prepared for the start of not just a busy weekend but a busy season ahead.

While things seemed to run smoothly for most major airlines in the U.S. as the holiday weekend got underway the same cannot be said for Delta Air Lines which canceled hundreds of flights accounting for nearly a tenth of its schedule on Saturday.

The disruptions came just a few days after TPG reported that the airline was making changes to its summer schedule because staffing problems had made it less able to accommodate things like bad weather. The carrier had anticipated storms could present problems in the eastern U.S. during the holiday weekend and had issued waivers in advance of the busiest travel days.

Still despite rising prices the latest COVID-19 surge and airlines and other travel providers continuing to face imperfect operating conditions the numbers show Americans are as anticipated traveling in a way not seen since before March of 2020.

3 busy travel days

As you might have expected Friday was the busiest day for air travelers heading out for Memorial Day weekend getaways. The TSA screened just under 2.4 million passengers both Thursday and Friday – both days that now rank among the top five busiest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The rush came despite this year's rise in airfare -- about a 28% spike for the holiday weekend compared to 2019 according to data from Hopper.

That both Thursday and Friday saw high passenger volume could be a nod to the added flexibility many American workers did not enjoy prior to the pandemic as pointed out by Clear the paid service that allows travelers to cut airport security lines after verifying their biometrics at a kiosk.

Clear said its data showed a 40% spike in verifications at U.S. airports on Wednesday Thursday and Friday compared to the same period in 2019. The agency saw that as a potential sign outbound Memorial Day traffic was more spread out than in pre-pandemic years ""changing how we view the normal Memorial Day Weekend rush"" Clear said in a statement Saturday.

Austin Bergstrom International Airport (AUS) shared photos of the busy travel morning heading into the long weekend on social media highlighting crowds inside its terminal.

Continuing a trend TPG has reported on throughout the spring airports have taken to social media to warn travelers that parking lots were filling up rapidly.

Saturday morning Miami International Airport (MIA) said on Twitter that its garages were ""reaching capacity"" due to record-breaking Memorial Day travel.

The airport asked travelers still heading to the airport this weekend to consider being dropped off by friends or family. The airport hasn't just approached pre-pandemic numbers in 2022; on one day earlier this spring it broke its all-time single-day record for passenger traffic.

Meanwhile Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) said as of mid-morning Saturday its non-reserved parking was completely full.

Preparing for the rush

From the airlines to the airports the travel industry had been preparing for what was expected to be the busiest few days in years.

At Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) in Texas officials told TPG they had been seeing passenger traffic approaching pre-pandemic levels through much of the spring.

Still airport leadership viewed Memorial Day weekend as a ""crescendo"" of that ramp-up DFW Executive Vice President for Revenue Management and Customer Experience Ken Buchanan said in an interview with TPG Friday pointing to the airport's efforts to fully open concessions iron out processes and showcase technological and physical upgrades made during the downtime of lower traffic points during the pandemic.

""There will be days where we will exceed 2019 levels"" Buchanan said of the anticipated 2022 summer travel season. ""Overall we will be close to 2019 but definitely there will be days where we will exceed 2019.""

As the airport approached the rush Buchanan and his team preached to staff about the need for readiness in hopes that by the time the weekend rolled around they would be prepared to handle the surge in traffic.

""We want to remove the emotion of anger out of the travel experience"" he said.

Delta facing continued operational issues

Recent operational issues did not let up for Delta Air Lines though as the holiday weekend got underway.

After putting out notices this past week detailing staffing issues that had made it more vulnerable to external disruptions like bad weather the Atlanta-based carrier canceled hundreds of flights in the middle of the holiday weekend just a week after its worst operational day of the spring a week earlier when Delta canceled 280 flights.

As of Saturday afternoon Delta had canceled 243 flights about 9% of its schedule according to data from FlightAware on a weekend where storms in the Northeast and Southeast caused disruptions. Delta's operating base of Atlanta saw the most cancellations of any U.S. airport Saturday with 5-6% of its inbound and outbound flights canceled.

After storms Friday the other U.S. airports most affected included Newark Liberty International (EWR) New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and Delta's hub in Detroit (DTW).

By mid-afternoon Saturday Delta had already canceled about 75 flights for Sunday.

The carrier is planning flight cutbacks going forward in the summer months largely aimed at reducing disruptions by making its schedule more manageable as it navigates subpar staffing levels. In a memo last week the airline pointed out that the resurgence of travel following the pandemic has in some ways amounted to the ""rebuilding"" of the airline.

Bottom line

As expected neither continued disruptions in the travel industry nor inflated prices seem to be holding back travelers. Numbers so far on Memorial Day weekend show some of the largest crowds during the entire COVID-19 pandemic heading to airports.

As you return from the long weekend or prepare for your first getaway be sure to keep an eye on social media feeds at your departure and arrival airports in case there's important information to know – whether about parking wait times or anything else to expect during your travels.

Delta Air Lines suffered the most among U.S. airlines with more than 240 flights or 9% of its operations eliminated on Saturday. Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta where Delta is based and has its largest hub was heavily affected by the travel delays. On Saturday 5% of the flights there were canceled while 7% were delayed.

Delta noted in an email to The Associated Press that Saturday's cancellations were due to bad weather and ""air traffic control actions"" noting it's trying to cancel flights at least 24 hours in advance this Memorial Day weekend.

Delta announced on its website on Thursday that from July 1 to Aug. 7 it would reduce service by about 100 daily departures primarily in parts of the U.S. and Latin America that Delta frequently serves.

""More than any time in our history the various factors currently impacting our operation — weather and air traffic control vendor staffing increased Covid case rates contributing to higher-than-planned unscheduled absences in some workgroups — are resulting in an operation that isn't consistently up to the standards Delta has set for the industry in recent years"" said Delta's Chief Customer Experience Officer Allison Ausband in a post.

Airlines and tourist destinations are anticipating monster crowds this summer as travel restrictions ease and pandemic fatigue overcomes lingering fear of contracting Covid-19 during travel.

Many forecasters believe the number of travelers will match or even surpass levels in the good-old pre-pandemic days. However airlines have thousands fewer employees than they did in 2019 and that has at times contributed to widespread flight cancellations.

People who are only now booking travel for the summer are experiencing the sticker shock.

Domestic airline fares for summer are averaging more than $400 for a round trip 24% higher than this time in 2019 before the pandemic and a robust 45% higher than a year ago according to travel-data firm Hopper.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMjQvdHJhdmVsL2FpcmxpbmUtZmxpZ2h0LWl0aW5lcmFyeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Help! The Airline Changed My Flight Itinerary (for the Worse) (Published 2022),"Dear Tripped Up

My question is about airlines switching itineraries a huge frustration for me since returning to travel after a pandemic pause. I will book a direct flight at a good time and then get an email days or weeks later with an inconvenient time change or an added layover or both. The worst was when I was planning a trip with my daughter to Tampa Fla. In January I booked a direct flight on Southwest Airlines that left Hartford Conn. at 12:30 p.m. on April 17 and arrived in Tampa three hours later. Perfect. But on Feb. 15 Southwest emailed that they had moved me onto a 6:15 p.m. flight with a nearly three-hour layover in Nashville getting me to Tampa at 1:10 a.m.! Why is this OK? It’s like I bought a nice Subaru Forester and they delivered a dilapidated and rusty Trans Am and told me it was the only option. Phoebe Massachusetts

Dear Phoebe

Leave it to airlines to make car dealerships seem transparent by comparison. While you could certainly sue your fictional dealer for breach of contract the real Southwest was within their contractual rights to cancel your original flight and put you on that midnight plane from Nashville.

There’s no law against an airline unilaterally changing your itinerary and in such cases the main rule the U.S. government requires the airlines to follow is a flimsy one. If a carrier imposes a new itinerary on a customer that would result in a “significant delay” the company must offer you a refund in your case $264 each for two “Wanna Get Away” fares Southwest’s equivalent of economy class.

They did but as you told me over Zoom canceling the trip wouldn’t do: You wanted to go to Florida and had already arranged lodging. The airline gave you another option saying you could search for an alternative Southwest itinerary then make the change online or through customer service (which you did painfully as we’ll get to later).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvZGVsdGEtYWlyLWxpbmVzLW1lbW9yaWFsLWRheS13ZWVrZW5kLWtpY2tzLW9mZi9zdG9yeT9pZD04NTAyMDMwMdIBZGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vYW1wL1BvbGl0aWNzL2RlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy1tZW1vcmlhbC1kYXktd2Vla2VuZC1raWNrcy1vZmYvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9ODUwMjAzMDE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines kick off summer travel season with busy Memorial Day weekend,"The kickoff for the summer travel season is in full swing as millions of travelers take to the roads and the skies for Memorial Day weekend.

Over the holiday 2.1 million passengers per day are expected to go through security checkpoints at airports nationwide according to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The volume could exceed pre-pandemic levels TSA said.

“Passengers should expect airports to be extremely busy” Robert Spinden the federal security director at TSA said in an interview with ABC News. “But we're prepared.”

To meet the demand Spinden said his agency has increased the use of overtime and is allowing officers that are in part-time status to convert to full-time. The agency is also “aggressively” recruiting new officers in preparation for the summer travel rush he said.

Airlines are also gearing up for the busy travel weekend. United Airlines expects an average of 4000 flights a day over the weekend American Airlines says it will average 5700 flights a day and Delta Air Lines is planning on 4500 daily flights per day.

“We've been waiting on this moment in this weekend for two years” Allison Ausband chief customer experience officer and executive vice president at Delta said in an interview with ABC News. “It kicks off the summer season but for Delta people it really kicks back that we are back to normal.”

The airline expects to fly approximately 2.5 million customers between Thursday and Monday -- up 25% from last year. Ausband said domestic leisure travel has fully recovered from pandemic lows and transatlantic travel continues to improve. The airline will service 275 destinations over the holiday weekend.

“In many ways this is just sort of like a dry run for the summer because you're expecting even more passengers after this?” asked ABC News transportation correspondent Gio Benitez.

“It is a dry run but we want the dry run to go great this weekend because that will tell us right how the rest of the summer is going to go” Ausband said.

As demand continues to increase from pandemic lows airlines have had to adjust their schedules. Bad weather in April compounded the issue by forcing airlines to cancel thousands of flights amid the boom.

The ongoing pilot shortage has also had an impact on operations. Bad weather in April compounded the issue by forcing airlines to cancel thousands of flights amid the boom.

“We never like to cancel a flight. I hope our customers know that it is the last resort that we take. Honestly it's bad for our customers and it's bad for our people. It's bad for the operation” Ausband said. “We have built so much trust and confidence being number one from a reliability perspective. And so even one cancel. It doesn't it doesn't feel good.”

The airline said it would notify customers of the changes “as far in advance as possible.”

To prevent travel disruptions Delta announced Thursday it plans to cut 100 flights a day from its schedule between July 1 and August 7. The airline said the move will “build additional resilience in [its] system and improve operational reliability for [its] customers and employees; we’ll continue to proactively adjust select flights in the coming weeks.”

New technology put to the test over the holiday weekend

Throughout the pandemic airlines implemented new technology aimed at making the travel experience faster and hands-free.

Last year Delta launched a digital identity feature -- a first-of-its-kind pilot program that will implement facial recognition technology at certain airports across the country. Ausband said the program will “continue to grow throughout [their] network.”

“We want it to be effortless for the customer – touch free hands free” Ausband said.

And in the security lane -- TSA has over the past few years begun deploying computed tomography x-ray systems at airports nationwide. The scanners use “sophisticated algorithms” to detect weapons explosives and other prohibited items by creating 3-D images of carry-on items.

“This not only enhances our security effectiveness but provides an efficiency for the passengers by allowing them to maintain more items inside their property than what they could prior” Spinden said.

“[The pandemic] gave us the opportunity at Delta to say let's take a blank sheet of paper and reimagine the customer experience on board” Ausband said.

Masks no longer required for travel

With the federal mask mandate lifted airlines are no longer requiring passengers to wear a face covering on flights. Most airports across the country have also done away with the requirement though some have kept it in place in accordance with local laws.

For those who may be concerned Ausband said “It is going to be busy getting through but know that it's absolutely safe. If you want to wear your mask on board you can absolutely wear your mask on board.”

Airlines have touted enhanced cleaning protocols since the beginning of the pandemic. Ausband said things like cleaning between flights and hand sanitizer on planes are here to stay at Delta.

“The pandemic gave us an opportunity to rethink how we clean our airplanes. So those care standards that we implemented are still there” Ausband said.

Preparing for the travel rush

For those who are planning to fly this weekend experts recommend getting to the airport early and making sure your carry-on luggage is properly packed with no prohibited items on board.

“There are going to be a lot of travelers so expect there to be long lines and expect it to take a while to check your bag or to get through security” Scott Keyes founder of the flight deal subscription service Scott’s Cheap Flights said. “If you have TSA PreCheck or clear or something like that certainly make use of it this weekend because otherwise it could be a long wait to get to your flight.”

The busiest airports this weekend will be Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Los Angeles International Airport and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport according to Hopper an online travel booking platform.

“We've got two years of pent-up vacations that we haven't had to take” Jenn McNeely a flight attendant at Delta Air Lines told ABC. “But we're ready. We're excited and let's get going.”"

I am sure that you must have believed most of the information on social media platforms such as YouTube Instagram Twitter Facebook or even Snapchat without checking other sources.

But there are a lot of people and organisations who recklessly upload false information.

This is where regulation comes in. Not only does it minimise the chances of receiving false information it also reduces the possibility of creating conflict among people.

Additionally this will ensure that there is a standard that users must follow which will make them strictly adhere to the rules.

How to delete yourself from the internet

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on countries around the world.

In the United States the public response to the health crisis was impeded by the spread of fake news which included false claims of treatment methods and ways to prevent the virus.

By introducing laws to regulate social media we can help the world better handle such global issues and keep people away from false information that can cause panic among the public.

Also there is FOMO or “fear of missing out” a social media phenomenon that is becoming increasingly common and can cause significant stress in your life.

The feeling that others are having more fun living better lives or experiencing better things than you are can cause a deep sense of envy and affect your self-esteem.

What’s more social media can cause individuals to have a negative body image and even eating disorders.

Many students say social media has been harmful to the way they feel about their looks and they struggle not to compare themselves to the people they see online.

TikTok has become a top source of misinformation

Then there are instances where social media has been used to spark riots and violent protests in countries.

Teenagers who are addicted to social media are more likely to engage in cyberbullying. Their victims can suffer from anxiety depression or other stress-related conditions.

I don’t believe that regulating social media platforms will pose a threat to freedom of speech.

It is the right thing to do to protect society from the evils of fake news.

Russian censorship law targets “fake news” about Ukraine

Who should regulate social media? The government? The tech giants? An international organisation? Or its users?

We are left with two choices – using AI technology by authorities or manual regulation with limited control over what happens on social media.

Regulating social media will only make matters worse.

Firstly it violates a basic human right – the freedom of expression.

What’s the line between regulating fake news and censorship? Photo: Shutterstock

As certain information becomes inaccessible regulation defies the purpose of social media which is the rapid spread of information.

According to American financial and business news website Business Insider shadowbanning refers to social media posts being taken down muted or hidden from followers without telling the creator. For instance Black creators’ content received less exposure when compared to that of their white peers on TikTok during the Black Lives Matter protest movement according to NBC News.

Some Republican politicians including former US president Donald Trump were also banned from Twitter. This deprives their right of sharing information through the platform.

Meta adds parental supervision tools on Instagram after backlash

Algorithms are designed to align with the values of their creators so they are naturally biased towards a certain group of people. The reality is that social media algorithms are trying to keep users entertained.

According to the British newspaper The Financial Times a text-to-speech service launched by TikTok last year in collaboration with Disney could not say the word “gay” for example.

Supposedly social media allows users to raise awareness of social issues but such regulations only increase discrimination against sexual orientation race and political belief.

Businesses both large and small heavily rely on data analytics and market research.

Should Hong Kong introduce a law to combat fake news?

TikTok pulled out of Hong Kong over a new national security law imposed by Beijing on July 1. The law has raised questions about freedom of speech and privacy concerns since police in Hong Kong no longer need a warrant to request user data from internet companies.

It is reasonable that Facebook has hired moderators to filter harmful content such as nudity and animal abuse round the clock.

Social media platforms realise the importance of spreading truthful information.

No one is forced to read anything because the user controls what he or she views.

Therefore social media platforms should definitely not be regulated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJydXNzZWxzdGltZXMuY29tLzIyOTAwMS9oaWdoLWRlbWFuZC1mb3Itc2Vjb25kLWhhbmQtY2xvdGhlcy1hcy1oaWdoLXN0cmVldC1jaGFpbnMtZGlzY292ZXItdGhlLW1hcmtldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High demand for second-hand clothes as high street chains discover the market,"Credit: Canva

Second-hand clothes are becoming increasingly popular and occupy an ever-increasing share of the clothing market. Young people in particular no longer find them dusty and boring but sustainable trendy and cheap.

""The figures are impressive"" professor and lecturer in fashion management at the University of Antwerp Annick Schramme told VRT. Commercial retail chains are also starting to increasingly focus on the more sustainable second-hand market.

""The second-hand market is currently growing three times as fast as the total fashion industry. By 2030 the second-hand trade is even expected to be twice as large as high street fashion"" she said.

Today people mainly still buy their clothes from the big chains according to Schramme. This is cheap clothing which is often only worn for a few years. But while the volume of this so-called 'fast fashion' is more or less stabilising the second-hand market is on the rise. This runs largely online via platforms such as the popular Vinted site.

""You can already see that some chains are responding to this and for example provide a corner within their own label to bring back vintage stock"" Schramme said. ""Even the big retailers. For example last year H&M set up a collaborative project with a Belgian vintage store where they could sell a selection of their vintage clothing in H&M.""

True vintage?

""To be truly vintage clothes must strictly speaking be at least 25 years old"" Schramme explained. ""Vintage is a quality label: they are original clothes of a certain label that have become this old and that are often still in good condition. There the question of authenticity arises. It is mainly about a group that specifically looks for that.""

Additionally in recent years a very large second-hand market has also emerged that is younger. ""Young people do not really care how old clothing is"" said Schramme. In that case 'second-hand' refers to all clothing that has already been worn by someone and that gets a second life through the sale.

For Schramme the popularity of the second-hand market can be explained by a combination of factors. ""On the one hand I think there is a bit of a social longing for the past. There is a retro trend. We also see this in other sectors such as furniture sales and gastronomy.""

But the price also plays a role: second-hand clothing is often cheaper. And more sustainable as well. ""Young people in particular are active on these online platforms from a greater sustainable awareness"" she said.

""For them it is often not only about buying but also about selling second-hand. With Generation Z we see that they really become entrepreneurs of their wardrobe: they wear clothes but then also sell them again. I even know more young people who sell than buy on such platforms.""

Then there is another important reason: the choice. ""People are actually looking for something personal"" Schramme said. ""It is also a bit of a reaction against ‘fast fashion' where everyone wears the same thing. Young people are looking for their identity and want something personal. That is certainly a reason why these platforms are so successful.""

What about sustainability?

Buying second-hand also has some disadvantages Schramme added. ""You can't feel it you can't smell it you can't try it on. But the threshold is so low that people are often really comfortable with it. If it does not fit it is sold again. So it's actually very accessible.""

Young people also look to the sustainability factor in the second-hand clothing market which may not be – in all cases – as straightforward as it first appears. ""Sustainability is of course a complex issue"" said Schramme.

""On the one hand you ensure that garments can have a second life and that clothing surpluses at chains for example do not have to be burned. But on the other hand you have all the logistics and transport"" she said. ""If you really want to live sustainably you have to take all those factors into account. But it is certainly a step in the right direction.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGZ0b2RheS5hZS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyLzA1LzI5L3VhZS10by1lbmhhbmNlLWl0cy1hYmlsaXR5LXRvLWRpc2NvdmVyLW5ldy10YWxlbnQtYW5kLWZ1dHVyZS1zcG9ydHMtc3RhcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UAE to enhance its ability to discover new talent and future sports stars,"The board of directors of the UAE Sports Federation for School and University Education Institutions take part in a virtual meeting.

Gulf Today Staff Reporter

The UAE Sports Federation for School and University Education Institutions — which held its maiden board meeting under the chairmanship of Dr Ahmad Belhoul Al Falasi Minister of Education and Chairman of the General Authority of Sports — discussed the framework to improve the mechanism of discovering young talent and ensuring their development.

The meeting followed the formation of the new federation in December 2021 through the integration of the UAE School Sport Association and the UAE University Sport Association.

The federation's board of directors include representatives of all educational bodies thus supporting the inclusiveness of the sports movement and strengthening coordination between the education and sports sectors.

The meeting discussed the reality of sports in schools and universities and measures required to foster it by providing the right environment for talent discovery as well as to develop long-term plans in which the educational sector collaborates with the sports sector to develop a talent discovery mechanism paving the way for them to fulfill global achievements.

Falasi who heads the federation’s board of directors said: “The new federation reflects the concerted national efforts by the authority the education sector and all strategic partners in strengthening the sports action system through the development of a mechanism for discovering and empowering sports talent in schools and universities.

“This is being done to support the country's sports teams with renewed talent as well as provide the best possibilities to reach a more prosperous future for UAE sport. The federation also aims to strengthen coordination between various educational institutions in terms of sport.”

The federation is targeting more than 1174000 students in all the schools of UAE 20 per cent of which belong to Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) 28 per cent from the Emirates Schools Establishment 9 per cent from private schools in Ajman Ras al-Khaimah Fujairah and Umm Al Quwain 25 per cent from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority - Dubai and 18 per cent from the Sharjah Education Council and the Sharjah Private Education Authority.

This reflects the large size of the target segment across all schools enhancing opportunities to discover highly capable sports talent.

The meeting addressed the reality of sport in 35 universities within the federation and discussed ways to attract other universities. The statistics for the member universities indicated that there are 870 students who play football 750 students including 430 girls who play volleyball 720 students including 300 girls who play basketball with an infrastructure of 22 stadiums.

The participating universities also previously saw five sports workshops in which 451 students participated in addition to participating in five virtual championships in the past 3 years and several great achievements.

The accomplishments include Maha Al Breki earning the bronze medal in the World University Championships 2020 as well as participating in three world championships two of which were hosted by the UAE in 2019 and 2021.

Falasi said: “The Federation is working on enhancing our national teams and adding to the talent pool from different ages by building up the spirit of athletic competitiveness among students and showcasing the important role sports play in different aspects. This is in line with the sports sector’s 2032 strategy aimed at increasing levels of participation in the Olympics and establishing a suitable environment for athletes to develop their physical abilities in addition to creating a new generation capable of making sports achievements that will bring pride to the UAE regionally and internationally.”

The board of directors of the Federation includes Sheikh Suhail Bin Butti Al Maktoum Executive Director of the Sports Development Sector at the General Sports Authority; Azza Bint Sulaiman Assistant Secretary-General for Administrative and Financial Affairs of the National Olympic Committee; Dr Amna Al Dahak Al Shamsi Assistant Undersecretary for Welfare and Capacity Building Sector at the Ministry of Education; Mohammed Ahmed Almulla Secretary General of the Sharjah Education Council.

DG,Dollar General,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS9kb2xsYXItZ2VuZXJhbC13b3JrZXJzLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLXJhbGx5LXBheS1zYWZldHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar General Workers Are Fed Up,"Cowardly. That’s how David Williams who works at a Dollar General in New Orleans describes the discount retail chain’s resistance to workers’ demands for better wages and working conditions.

Raised in the city’s Lower Ninth Ward Williams has worked at Dollar General for around two-and-a-half years. He says that his starting wage was around $8 an hour; it is now $9.25. Williams works part-time and says that paying bills on Dollar General’s wages is “a constant struggle.”

“I never know when I’m gonna have my next meal I never know when I’ll be able to pay my rent” says Williams. “I’m constantly figuring out if I need to ask for extensions on bills and then I’m not sure I can even hit the extension’s deadline. It’s a constant struggle thinking about this every single day.”

Williams is one of more than 150 Dollar General employees who traveled to the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Goodlettsville Tennessee on Wednesday May 25 to demand that company executives address low wages understaffing and hazardous working conditions. The workers were joined by labor advocacy groups such as the Fight for $15 United for Respect and Step Up Louisiana as well as workers from Amazon Starbucks Walmart Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.

Dollar General has enjoyed steady profits despite the pandemic and CEO Todd Vasos was paid $1.7 million in 2021 a 37 percent pay bump that amounts to 986 times more than the median wage of one of the company’s 163000 workers in the more than 18000 stores across the United States.

A recent report from the Economic Policy Institute finds that 92 percent of Dollar General employees make less than $15 an hour. Twenty-two percent make less than $10 an hour; Williams is just one of them.

The pandemic was the final straw for many of these workers who have begun speaking up about not only low wages but pervasive health and safety concerns. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) has cited Dollar General fifty-five times since 2016 fining the company a total of $3.6 million. As OSHA regional administrator Kurt Petermeyer said following a recent citation Dollar General has a “long and extensive history of workplace safety violations” and “blatant and continued disregard for the safety of their employees.”

Williams says that his biggest concern is the heat. He drinks two Powerades and a large bottle of water during his shift to stave off dehydration. When he speaks to management about the temperature in the store they often say that the air-conditioning is on and working and don’t seem concerned about the temperature.

“I’m pretty sure that when it’s that hot and you’re trying to do your job as well who’s to say that you can’t have a heat stroke” says Williams. Asked about working at Dollar General more generally he characterizes the job as “the ugliest thing you’ll ever see.”

“It’s a pain so unbearable that you can’t describe it. That’s how horrific this is. Enough is enough. Dollar store workers put too much into this to get paid as they do” he adds.

Faulty air-conditioning was also a problem for Mary Gundel a manager of a Dollar General in Tampa Florida who was fired after her TikTok about the company’s hazardous working conditions went viral.

“At my store I found mold in the cooler and we had to work without proper ventilation when the air conditioner broke when it was hot outside — and that’s just one location” said Gundel who also took part in the Goodlettsville rally. “As a manager not a day went by where we were properly staffed forcing me to go beyond my duties to unpack boxes clear store aisles or work countless hours in overtime. It’s appalling that it had to take a viral video of my store’s conditions for the corporate executives to begin paying attention.”

Thus far attempts to unionize Dollar General stores have been defeated by the company. In 2020 Dollar General shut down a Missouri store that voted to unionize. In 2021 the company retained union-busting law firm Labor Relations Institute paying consultants $2700 per day to beat a union drive at a Connecticut location.

As one TikTok influencer shared there is an art to penny shopping at Dollar General.

1 TikToker couponingwithtaryn said penny shopping at Dollar General is like a scavenger hunt but you can find lots of deals

Taryn Blankenship who goes by couponingwithtaryn on TikTok shared with her nearly 37000 followers her tricks to finding penny items at Dollar General.

Taryn said when she first found out about penny shopping it took her about six months before she found her first one cent item.

She thought it was fake because it can be really hard to find the items.

Then she found some helpful resources to make penny shopping fun and as she described a ""scavenger hunt.""

What is penny shopping?

Taryn said when an item is discontinued at Dollar General it turns into a penny item.

She explained that employees are supposed to pull the item but sometimes the items are overlooked and remain on the shelves.

When that happens shoppers are allowed to buy those items for a penny.

How do you penny shop?

Taryn shared several tricks to help you penny shop.

She said she follows the Facebook group called Dollar General Penny Shopping started by The Freebie Guy.

Taryn said there are other groups which talk about penny shopping but she started with this group and found it to be helpful.

She suggested if you join the group to make sure you read all the announcements because there are several tips on penny shopping.

The next step you'll need to do is download the Dollar General app.

Taryn said you'll need to start an account so that you can scan items in the store.

Taryn said another site she likes to check is thepennylist.

This is where she'll find updates on what items are selling for a penny.

She did note that one time there was a five week lull without a new list.

What if you find a penny item?

Taryn said if you successfully find a penny item it will show up in the app as $0.01 when you scan the barcode.

She said if the app is glitchy it may show $0.00.

She also suggested not asking Dollar General employees about penny items because she found they won't tell you.

Taryn said some managers are ""cool"" about it and some aren't.

Plus if you find a penny item Taryn said don't feel greedy take them all.

She added that's because a Dollar General employee has the right to ask you where you found it and can pull the rest off the shelves.

In the end when you are looking for penny items Taryn said you need to look high and low move things around but always clean up after yourself.

Seated at a hotel conference table across the street from the Apple store where she worked in Atlanta she listened as her boss suggested to a dozen colleagues that they should be grateful to be paid more than other retail employees.

It was among a series of arguments he made this month at an off-site meeting ahead of the store’s vote on whether to join the Communications Workers of America union. Ms. Rhodes a 26-year-old union organizer considered the roughly $4 more per hour that Apple paid relative to other stores insufficient.

Before a recent promotion she supported herself by bouncing from part-time work helping customers with iPhones to a second job delivering Amazon packages to a third shift loading boxes at FedEx. She had championed the union because she thought it could boost hourly pay and increase full-time opportunities for a largely part-time staff.

In April Ms. Rhodes’s advocacy helped garner support from 70 percent of the store’s 100-plus workers for a union election. But as her boss pushed back over dinner at a Sheraton Hotel she could sense that support beginning to fray.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYWxpbmEuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9zYWxpbmEtY29tbXVuaXR5LXRoZWF0cmUtaGFzLW5ldy1uYW1lLXJlZmxlY3RpbmctaXRzLWdyb3d0aC1yZWFjaC1zYWxpbmUtY291bnR5LXBlcmZvcm1pbmctYXJ0cy85OTMwMDQwMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salina Community Theatre has a new name reflecting its growth reach,"As people drive down Iron Avenue in Salina they may notice a new sign and name at a familiar and popular destination in the downtown area Theatre Salina.

Earlier this year what was once Salina Community Theatre made the change in its name after a couple of years of discussion about what the theater means to people inside and outside the community of Salina.

""We are much more regional than we've ever been"" said Michael Spicer executive director for Theatre Salina.

According to Spicer about 40% of the ticket sales for the various theatrical productions at Theatre Salina come from people outside of Saline County.

""Last year coming out of COVID we sold tickets in 30 different states"" Spicer said.

This regional and national appeal to the theatrical arts in Salina is a sign of the success and growth the theater has seen since the building was expanded in 2011.

""A big part of that has been an expansion in education"" Spicer said. ""We've been fortunate to have some pretty dedicated teachers since this building's been open especially.""

As that educational aspect of the theater has grown it was clear that it needed to continue with strong leadership for the theater's education program the Center for Theatre Arts (CTA) as Megan Coberly the education director for Theatre Salina moves on with a new chapter in her life as her husband accepted a position at Columbia University.

A nation-wide search for a replacement led to several candidates for the position but a familiar face was decided as the best fit for the job Maggie Spicer Brown who grew up in the theater and is a graduate of Oklahoma City University.

The importance of education at the community-theater level

Brown is excited to take on this role and see how educational opportunities can be expanded as she knows the benefits of having a strong education within a community theater.

""Every year we watch our students whether it be in the musical theater program or the dance program develop their skills strengthen their skills (and) get stronger with their skills"" Brown said.

Each year the theater looks at that educational programming and sees how it can expand to include new skills and strengthen the skills it already has.

An example of this has been adding hip-hop dance classes within the past two years.

""They were only in the summer and there was such a demand that we did them during the school year"" Brown said. ""The first year we started with seven students and this year we have 14.""

It's not only maintaining an education director with the hiring of Brown that Theatre Salina has done to help with this expansion of educational opportunities. It also announced that its ballet instructor Jessica Polzella would be hired on full-time and expand her role.

""We're able to add things that she has certification that other people at Theatre Salina or in town don't have"" Brown said. ""(These) are for adults small children and anyone in between to expand our repertoire that will eventually hopefully match the expansion of our spaces.""

Coberly said there are about 175 students currently enrolled in various classes but that amounts to over 350 class registrations.

""A lot of the kids take three or four classes; some take eight"" Coberly said.

It's not just individual classes that are nearly overflowing with students. Coberly said during the summer they offer musical theater camps.

""They have filled to the brim this summer"" Coberly said. ""We had to add one (more) and it's also full now.""

Never a dull moment at Theatre Salina

On top of these educational opportunities the theater also runs theatrical productions throughout the year.

Theatre Salina just announced the new 2022 to 2023 season which begins this September with seven shows including ""The Addams Family"" ""A Doll's House Part Two"" ""A Christmas Story"" and ""School of Rock!""

Spicer said the theater is closed on some holidays like Thanksgiving Christmas and New Year's but otherwise Theatre Salina is always a busy place.

""Besides those days there's rehearsals classes (and) performances in this space every other day of the year"" Spicer said. ""In most instances there are three to five different activities going on at any given moment.""

This last week in May is one of the few times the theater only has one thing really going on. ""Kinky Boots"" which closes out the 2021 to 2022 season. The show is in rehearsals and that's about it right now but that all changes as the calendar moves into the next month.

""In June we'll have 'Kinky Boots' in performance we'll be auditioning 'Addams Family' Summerstage will be up (and) Stage II will start"" Spicer said.

On top of that Coberly and Brown said the Center for Theatre Arts camp schedule begins May 31 and will go through July.

Spicer said he knows there are changes here now such as the new name and more changes on the horizon for Theatre Salina but he hopes that the people who come and buy tickets to performances take classes at CTA or find other reasons to come to Theatre Salina see these changes as positives.

""The people who know us the people who are our patrons know that the quality of what they're going to see here is going to be the same whether (the name is) Theatre Salina or Salina Community"" Spicer said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2tkaG5ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3Nwb3J0cy1jYXJkcy1hbmQtY29sbGVjdGlibGVzLXNob3Atb3BlbmluZy1qdW5lLTctaW4ta2lsbGVlbi9hcnRpY2xlX2FlZjJmNmE4LWRlYzktMTFlYy1hZjhiLWZmODQyNTBjZTkwNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sports cards and collectibles shop opening June 7 in Killeen,"1.

DLTR,Dollar Tree,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS9kb2xsYXItZ2VuZXJhbC13b3JrZXJzLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLXJhbGx5LXBheS1zYWZldHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar General Workers Are Fed Up,"Cowardly. That’s how David Williams who works at a Dollar General in New Orleans describes the discount retail chain’s resistance to workers’ demands for better wages and working conditions.

Raised in the city’s Lower Ninth Ward Williams has worked at Dollar General for around two-and-a-half years. He says that his starting wage was around $8 an hour; it is now $9.25. Williams works part-time and says that paying bills on Dollar General’s wages is “a constant struggle.”

“I never know when I’m gonna have my next meal I never know when I’ll be able to pay my rent” says Williams. “I’m constantly figuring out if I need to ask for extensions on bills and then I’m not sure I can even hit the extension’s deadline. It’s a constant struggle thinking about this every single day.”

Williams is one of more than 150 Dollar General employees who traveled to the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Goodlettsville Tennessee on Wednesday May 25 to demand that company executives address low wages understaffing and hazardous working conditions. The workers were joined by labor advocacy groups such as the Fight for $15 United for Respect and Step Up Louisiana as well as workers from Amazon Starbucks Walmart Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.

Dollar General has enjoyed steady profits despite the pandemic and CEO Todd Vasos was paid $1.7 million in 2021 a 37 percent pay bump that amounts to 986 times more than the median wage of one of the company’s 163000 workers in the more than 18000 stores across the United States.

A recent report from the Economic Policy Institute finds that 92 percent of Dollar General employees make less than $15 an hour. Twenty-two percent make less than $10 an hour; Williams is just one of them.

The pandemic was the final straw for many of these workers who have begun speaking up about not only low wages but pervasive health and safety concerns. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) has cited Dollar General fifty-five times since 2016 fining the company a total of $3.6 million. As OSHA regional administrator Kurt Petermeyer said following a recent citation Dollar General has a “long and extensive history of workplace safety violations” and “blatant and continued disregard for the safety of their employees.”

Williams says that his biggest concern is the heat. He drinks two Powerades and a large bottle of water during his shift to stave off dehydration. When he speaks to management about the temperature in the store they often say that the air-conditioning is on and working and don’t seem concerned about the temperature.

“I’m pretty sure that when it’s that hot and you’re trying to do your job as well who’s to say that you can’t have a heat stroke” says Williams. Asked about working at Dollar General more generally he characterizes the job as “the ugliest thing you’ll ever see.”

“It’s a pain so unbearable that you can’t describe it. That’s how horrific this is. Enough is enough. Dollar store workers put too much into this to get paid as they do” he adds.

Faulty air-conditioning was also a problem for Mary Gundel a manager of a Dollar General in Tampa Florida who was fired after her TikTok about the company’s hazardous working conditions went viral.

“At my store I found mold in the cooler and we had to work without proper ventilation when the air conditioner broke when it was hot outside — and that’s just one location” said Gundel who also took part in the Goodlettsville rally. “As a manager not a day went by where we were properly staffed forcing me to go beyond my duties to unpack boxes clear store aisles or work countless hours in overtime. It’s appalling that it had to take a viral video of my store’s conditions for the corporate executives to begin paying attention.”

Thus far attempts to unionize Dollar General stores have been defeated by the company. In 2020 Dollar General shut down a Missouri store that voted to unionize. In 2021 the company retained union-busting law firm Labor Relations Institute paying consultants $2700 per day to beat a union drive at a Connecticut location.

Workers see the Goodlettsville rally as the next step in increasing pressure on the company. Coming as it does at a time when other low-wage workers in the retail sector are beginning to organize other large companies — from Starbucks to Apple Target and Trader Joe’s — Dollar General workers say that now is the time to change what has become intolerable.

On Tuesday Walmart said it would remove its store-brand ice cream celebrating Juneteenth amid growing condemnation of the retailer trivializing the day for profit.

""Juneteenth holiday marks a celebration of freedom and independence"" the company said in a statement. ""However we received feedback that a few items caused concern for some of our customers and we sincerely apologize. We are reviewing our assortment and will remove items as appropriate.""

Juneteenth commemorates the day (June 191865) when enslaved African-Americans returned in Galveston Texas to news they were freed. On June 17 2021 President Joe Biden signed a law that made Juneteenth a federal holiday.

Experts noted that marketing Juneteenth-branded products amounts to companies only profit off Black suffering — specifically the 400 years of slavery led to systemic disadvantages that persist today.

“It is hard not to worry that Juneteenth will be watered down or distorted now that it is a federal holiday"" Matthew Delmont a historian at Dartmouth College told Yahoo Finance. ""Having this date on the national calendar every year offers an opportunity to talk honestly about our nation's history and to come together in community to celebrate the generations of Black Americans who have fought for freedom and equality.”

Kevin Cokley chair of the educational psychology department at the University of Texas told Yahoo Finance: “If Walmart did not think the commercialization of Juneteenth would not be profitable they would not have created Juneteenth ice cream. Period.”

Cokley added that “the true meaning of Juneteenth can easily be lost through consumerism and widespread consumption.”

As of Friday Walmart continued selling numerous Juneteenth-themed books party supplies and t-shirts including one black tank-top with the phrase: “Because my ancestors weren’t free in 1976” – an apparent mistaken reference to the year of American independence in 1776.

(Walmart)

“Juneteenth has been celebrated for more than 150 years without needing specifically-branded products” Delmont said. “Attempts to profit from the holiday take attention away from the meaning of Juneteenth because you don't need to buy things to celebrate emancipation or the long road to freedom that followed.”

Walmart isn't the only corporate culprit.

Dollar Tree the discount variety store also faced backlash for promoting a Juneteenth-inspired line of party supplies and tableware with the Pan-African colors of green red and yellow instead of Juneteenth official colors of blue white and red.

Dollar Tree did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Yahoo Finance. The products featured on their official Twitter page were also no longer available online as of Friday morning.

Overall the commoditization of American holidays is a common occurrence.

“Once any signal event is declared a national holiday it is subject to potential commercialization” William Darity a public policy professor at Duke University and racial equity expert told Yahoo Finance.

Darity added that the Juneteenth's national acknowledgement ironically may take away from “the compelling need for a comprehensive national program for Black American reparations.""

“Imagine how different the landscape would look if Juneteenth had been designated as a federal holiday after reparations had been paid” he said.

Last week Walmart appeared to be gearing up to release its Great Value brand “Celebration Edition Juneteenth” ice cream in honor of the newest federal holiday. But after much backlash on social media the retail giant announced that they would no longer be moving forward with the controversial rollout.

According to CNN Walmart announced it was reviewing its product offerings.

“Juneteenth holiday marks a celebration of freedom and independence” a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday according to CNN. “However we received feedback that a few items caused concern for some of our customers and we sincerely apologize. We are reviewing our assortment and will remove items as appropriate.”

The swirled red velvet and cheesecake ice cream was reportedly slated to come packaged in a yellow green and red container reminiscent of the Pan-African flag. The oddly designed product also featured two Black hands high-fiving each other.

“Share and celebrate African-American culture emancipation and enduring hope” the label on the ice cream read.

Social media reacts to Walmart’s Juneteenth ice cream

Many social media users called out the mega-corporation for attempting to commercialize and weaken the message behind the commemorative holiday. Juneteenth which originally fell on June 19 1865 celebrates the day that enslaved African Americans were freed.

Other people criticized the white-owned brand for profiting off of Black suffering.

“I never celebrated Juneteenth being made a national holiday. I knew it was pure mockery” wrote one person on Twitter. “America has mastered the science of commercializing our pain. The ice cream was just a test run. Next they’ll be selling Juneteenth whip & chains in the toy department. They are who they are!”

CNN noted another critic slammed the company on social media about the perceived lack of “diverse voices at the table when making strategic business decisions.” ” When you don’t you end up making costly foolish mistakes” they added.

Although the company is recalling the problematic ice cream Walmart still appears to be selling a number of Juneteenth-inspired items including party supplies plates T-shirts and books. A NewsOne staff member spotted a full Juneteenth display at a Walmart in Decatur GA while picking up some household basics.

Sadly Walmart isn’t the only big American company attempting to cash in on the historic holiday. As previously reported by Yahoo! Finance Dollar Tree also faced backlash for promoting their Juneteenth-inspired decorative line of party supplies and tableware featuring Pan-African colors. However the items appeared to have been scrubbed from the website since.

Last year President Biden signed a law making Juneteenth a federal holiday.

“This is a day of profound wait and profound power” he said during his speech. “A day which you’ll remember the moral stain the terrible toll that slavery took on the country and continues to take.”

Vice President Kamala Harris echoed Biden’s sentiment noting how the national holiday “makes an important statement.”

“These are days when we as a nation have decided to stop and take stock and often to acknowledge our history” she added.

The writer seems to believe the solar project sited on Lehigh University’s institutionally-zoned land that borders the Saucon Fields condominium homes was driven by a profit-seeking developer imposing an unwanted land-use on a relatively defenseless community.

While the author admires Lehigh University’s effort to install a solar project to make additional but modest reductions in climate emissions he suggests the university should either move the location of its planned solar energy project or pay for his preferred approach to offsetting the impact of the project on the neighbors. He bemoans the inadequacy of developer-friendly zoning regulations and approval processes because they only allow the public to briefly comment before approval.

As observers from inside the university we have a different point of view.

First we commend the writer for noticing problems with the local zoning processes. Many community members have been complaining about this for years as uninvited developers impose luxury student housing complexes in the areas surrounding Lehigh University.

The residents of Saucon Fields might have found many sympathetic allies if they had bothered to participate in efforts to stop unwanted development before it came to their own backyard. Given the wide range of things that Lehigh University can legally do on the land where the solar project will be located we think the impacts on residents of Saucon Fields are minor especially in comparison to the many low-income community members who are being priced out of their homes by expensive student housing in South Bethlehem.

Surely the residents of Saucon Fields didn’t think buying property that borders land zoned “institutional” meant the neighboring land would be kept in agricultural use in perpetuity. Other perfectly legal uses of the land such as a parking lot might be less appealing to the neighbors and offer fewer multiple-use opportunities for neighbors to enjoy.

Second we take issue with how the editorial characterizes the goals and impact of Lehigh University’s effort to achieve carbon neutrality. Academic institutions should be leaders in taking actions in the present that will be of benefit to people living in the future. This is because academic institutions can expect to be around for the next 50 to 100 years. Even the federal government seems increasingly unlikely to ensure its own viability over that same time period.

We believe the university’s goals should be ambitious in charting a path toward carbon neutrality. Many other institutions squander Earth’s atmospheric resources and treat small actions as meaningless simply because the impact of small reductions in climate emissions is meaningless to those who run these institutions or the people they serve.

This leads us to our third point. Climate change is a threat to the future of the planet and is already wreaking havoc on people throughout the world. Life might be perfectly fine in the Saucon Fields condominium homes but we believe the people suffering from wildfires in California from severe drought in Africa and from flooding in Alaska appreciate every 5% reduction in institutionally produced carbon emissions. We think they wish they had not lost their homes and would probably accept a slight drop in their property’s value if it meant they could stay in their communities.

We hope Lehigh University’s effort to reduce carbon emissions will help set a path toward a future in which the grandchildren of people living in Saucon Fields condominium homes have a planet to leave their own grandchildren around the year of 2100. At that time we can expect that the world will be at least 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it is right now.

To help put this in perspective the difference between the temperature of the last Ice Age and the present geologic era is only about 5 degrees Celsius. We commend Lehigh University for taking the climate problem seriously. We invite residents of Saucon Fields condominium homes to join ongoing efforts to give residents who live in South Bethlehem more control over land-use decisions that benefit uninvited developers who are profiting from development that is pushing lower-income residents out of their communities.

The program which started with $50000 two years ago soon will have around $625000 secured in an endowment.

The fund is meant to provide $2000 tuition grants annually to any Black Middleton family descendant who wants one. Middleton Place Foundation staff hope to get another challenge match soon and to set a new financial target of $1 million CEO Tracey Todd said.

“That would give the (Middleton Scholars) committee more flexibility to support people in different ways” he said.

The program is part of a larger effort at Middleton Place to broaden its outreach and engagement as well as its historical interpretation in ways that move the African American experience to center stage.

Middleton Place leaders also have updated its house tour changed its “Beyond the Fields” tour about slavery added new information about the enslaved population that’s displayed inside Eliza’s House and altered the design of the stableyard exhibits.

Some of the modifications already have taken effect; others are in the works.

The idea for the tuition assistance program first was broached at the 2016 Middleton family reunion a large event that gathers Black and White descendants together at the historic plantation site.

After it launched in 2021 the program received one application and awarded Juanita Barr $2000. This year the program distributed eight awards Todd said.

Program committee members redefined and broadened the award calling it “tuition assistance” and welcoming applications not only from students enrolled in four-year degree programs but also those attending community colleges trade schools or other institutions of higher learning.

“We wanted to remove barriers and make it as available and useful as it could be” Todd said.

Recipients can reapply each year.

“The goal is to support as many applicants as we have” Todd said."

Pizza restaurant chain Domino's Pizza (DPZ -0.11%) has been one of the market's big winners over the past decade generating roughly 1000% returns compared to 200% for the S&P 500. However the stock has fallen more than 30% over the past six months.

The company's growth strategy has heavily leaned on its balance sheet leaving the business with a high debt load as we possibly head for a recession.

Investors shouldn't panic but there are legitimate reasons for some concern. Here is what you need to know and how it could impact the stock.

Domino's gushes free cash flow

Domino's Pizza has enjoyed a decade of strong growth; the company grew its store count from 10255 at the end of 2012 to 18848 at the end of 2021. Combine that with consistent same-store sales growth and the company as a whole has grown revenue by 10% annually on average over the past decade.

Domino's does numerous things to compete in a very fragmented industry. Customers can place their orders through a smartphone app making ordering a convenient experience. It uses a franchise model for its stores so the company isn't responsible for most of the day-to-day expenses of running the stores.

Its nearly 19000 stores also give the company economies of scale. Its larger size gives it buying power on raw ingredients and more efficient logistics. Local mom-and-pop pizzerias often struggle to compete on price because they don't have these advantages.

These factors have made Domino's increasingly good at generating free cash flow. You can see how the company once turned between $0.06 and $0.08 of every revenue dollar into cash flow but that has risen to nearly $0.13.

But does it have a spending problem?

Earnings-per-share (EPS) has grown an average of 22% annually over the past decade helping explain the stock's massive success. Profits will double in just over three years at that rate meaning the share price doubles if the stock's price-to-earnings ratio remains the same.

So how is Domino's growing profits so much faster than revenue? Share repurchases have played a significant role in that. The company buys its own stock which leaves fewer shares to spread profits across.

Management has used massive repurchase programs exceeding the company's total free cash flow multiple times over the past ten years. Domino's also pays a dividend which uses nearly 30% of its cash flow. In other words it's spending more money than it's making.

What impact could the balance sheet have on the stock?

You can see the evidence of this below in the balance sheet. Domino's is taking on increasingly higher debt over time now up to $5 billion against just $165 million in cash. Its debt is more than five times the company's EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes deprecation amortization) a higher ratio than I would feel comfortable with.

This is unsustainable and with interest rates rising amid a potential recession Domino's will likely get a lot more conservative moving forward. It's one thing when zero-percent rates make debt cheap but borrowing is harder when rates go up.

Management will probably need to dramatically scale back its share repurchases which will cause the company's EPS growth to slow down to something much closer to its revenue growth of 10% which is less than half of Domino's 10-year EPS growth rate).

The market could look at slowing profit growth and decide that the stock deserves a lower valuation and this ""chain reaction"" could explain why the stock has stumbled over the past six months.

Shares currently trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27 a discount to its 10-year median P/E of 32. However with a loaded balance sheet that could take years to pay down the stock could remain below its past valuation and investors should consider that before rushing to buy shares.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhemV0dGVsaXZlLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdGVlc3NpZGUtbmV3cy9mbGVldC1wb2xpY2UtdmVoaWNsZXMtYWlyLWFtYnVsYW5jZS0yNDA4ODk1NNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhemV0dGVsaXZlLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdGVlc3NpZGUtbmV3cy9mbGVldC1wb2xpY2UtdmVoaWNsZXMtYWlyLWFtYnVsYW5jZS0yNDA4ODk1NC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fleet of police vehicles and the air ambulance called to incident in Hartlepool,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Dividend Kings keep getting more attractive as the stock market seems shakier with every passing day. Inflation war interest rate hikes and slumping earnings. There’s plenty to be worried about.

As any study of long-term investing will show it’s time in the market that makes the difference. Investors have to keep capital in stocks to get the benefits of long-term compounding. With that in mind investors have to find stocks and construct a portfolio that can withstand recessions and bear markets.

There’s no better place to look for such resilient companies than the Dividend Kings. These are the companies that have increased their dividends for at least 50 years in a row.

As you might imagine there aren’t too many firms that have managed to make it to Dividend King status. In fact there are just 44 as of this year. For this article we’ll take it one step further going for companies with 60+ years of consecutive dividend hikes.

These seven Dividend Kings have proven that they can provide a growing income stream regardless of economic conditions.

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 67

At 67 years in a row American States Water currently has the longest-running consecutive dividend increase streak of the S&P 500 companies.

It’s not too hard to see why. Water utilities are among the most stable businesses out there. Regardless of what is going on with the economy people need fresh clean water.

Story continues

American States Water has been able to leverage that consistent demand into a solid growth rate with earnings per share increasing around 7%/year annually over the past decade.

In turn American States Water has increased its dividend by a similar amount annually as well. AWR stock offers a dividend yield of 1.9% which is certainly not the highest on this list.

However its unmatched record in terms of how long it has delivered annual dividend hikes and the inherent stability of its underlying business make American States Water a solid defensive Dividend King.

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 66

Dover is a diversified industrial company. It operates in a wide variety of segments including imaging and ID services pumps climate and sustainability technologies and engineered products.

Dover is not a particularly glamorous business but it keeps steadily ticking along. Earnings have grown 5% per year annualized over the past decade which has given it sufficient margin to keep increasing its dividend.

DOV stock is also a timely pick right now. Shares are down nearly 25% year to date. This has led DOV stock to sell at just 15 times forward earnings which is near its cheapest valuation of the past decade.

As with many Dividend Kings Dover is not the sort of company that will make anyone a fortune overnight but this steady industrial company serves as a top-notch growth and income machine over the long term.

Coca-Cola is one of Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks and it’s not hard to see why. The company sells almost $40 billion in soda and other beverages each and every year.

Regardless of what happens with the economy or political conditions Coca-Cola continues to sell the same amount of refreshments.

Soda isn’t much of a growth industry anymore. However Coca-Cola has done well in diversifying into other beverages such as water juices and sparkling water.

Meanwhile given the company’s unparalleled scale it has maintained strong cost advantages over its rivals leading to enviable profit margins.

Coca-Cola isn’t going to deliver strong short-term capital gains but its 2.8% dividend yield is rock solid and the company has raised that payout every year in a row dating back to the 1960s.

Emerson Electric (EMR)

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 65

A company with 65 consecutive years of dividend hikes might seem old-fashioned. However companies don’t become Dividend Kings without being able to evolve.

Emerson for example began as an industrial firm focused on making goods such as electric fans sewing machines and power tools. Over the decades Emerson has transformed itself. Nowadays the company is increasingly becoming a software company focusing on the automation of factories and industrial processes.

This is crucial technology right now. Supply chain issues and runaway inflation have made it more vital than ever to get the most out of a company’s existing manufacturing processes.

Emerson’s focus on efficiency and reducing industrial waste for its customers also stands out in the current marketplace which favors environmental social and governance (ESG) friendly investments.

Sometimes an old dog can learn new tricks and Emerson’s transformation into a forward-looking automation company has been one such impressive example.

3M Corp (MMM)

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 64

3M is an American industrial giant. It is most well-known for Post-It notes. However the company makes a vast array of products spanning safety equipment adhesives dental supplies industrial filters and much more.

In short 3M is a diversified conglomerate that in effect is a bet on American industry itself.

MMM stock is also shockingly cheap as it currently sells for just 13 times forward earnings. Traders are worried about the impact of a recession on the company along with some pending lawsuits around product liability.

Once these concerns pass however 3M shares should return to a more generous valuation ratio offering significant capital gains. In the meantime shares offer a compelling 4.1% dividend yield.

Northwest Natural (NWN)

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 66

Northwest Natural is a utility that operates primarily in Oregon and Washington.

Utilities tend to be a very stable business and Northwest Natural has been no exception to that rule. Generally gas utilities earn a regulated return rate and receive upward adjustments for inflation giving investors a reliable stream of cash flows over the decades.

Northwest Natural is not a compelling growth story by any means; it has grown revenues by about 2% per year compounded over the past decade.

However for investors that like a stable income story with a small annual increase NWN stock’s 3.5% starting dividend yield might be just the ticket.

Colgate-Palmolive (CL)

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 60

Toothpaste and cleaning products maker Colgate-Palmolive has had a forgettable decade.

In 2012 Colgate generated $17.1 billion in revenue. In 2021 this rose to just $17.4 billion which is a less than 1% annualized growth rate. Despite the brief surge in purchases with the pandemic Colgate has struggled to show much top-line growth.

Regardless the company’s dividend growth story rolls on. Due to sizable share buybacks and cost-cutting Colgate has managed to grow underlying earnings and in association its dividend payout despite the lack of revenue growth.

The 2020s may look better than the 2010s. Colgate has a huge presence in emerging markets and thus suffered as many of those countries saw weak economic performance in recent years. Now however with oil metals and agricultural prices through the roof countries such as Brazil should see stronger economic performance and thus lead to a solid upswing in Colgate’s profitability.

On the date of publication Ian Bezek held a long position in NWN EMR DOV and MMM stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.

By now it’s no secret: insurance companies can play a key role in helping the world steer away from mounting climate catastrophe by refusing to underwrite the expansion of dirty oil gas and coal infrastructure. That’s why climate advocates environmental justice organizers and concerned stakeholders have been escalating their demands on big insurers to stop propping up the fossil fuel industry and all its associated climate and financial risks.

Few insurance corporations are bigger and have more of a responsibility to act on climate than Liberty Mutual. That’s why it’s so alarming that Liberty Mutual board member Joseph “Jay” Hooley just became the new Lead Director of ExxonMobil perhaps the most powerful Big Oil supermajor on the planet.

ExxonMobil is one of the largest fossil fuel companies in the world. It is directly responsible for driving our global climate catastrophe as well for actively stalling climate progress for decades. Hooley joined ExxonMobil’s board of directors at the beginning of 2020 — and now as ExxonMobil’s Lead Director he is moving up the ranks to lead that board and oversee the governance of one of Big Oil’s top multinational powerhouses.

In this new role Hooley will be responsible for ensuring that ExxonMobil continues to rake in profits from its core business of oil and gas extraction and production for decades to come. He will also continue to earn compensation that gives him a personal financial interest in seeing ExxonMobil’s business boom. Hooley currently owns 13000 shares of ExxonMobil — worth well over $1 million — and his stake in the company is only set to grow. Hooley has a clear personal financial interest in seeing the company’s core business expand.

All this presents a grave conflict for Liberty Mutual where as a board member Hooley is in charge of governing the insurance powerhouse as it navigates a future of climate chaos and climate risk. While not nearly sufficient Liberty Mutual has made gestures around climate by for example limiting insurance coverage for some coal-intensive companies and pledging a 50% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Hooley’s governing role and financial interest in a global Big Oil powerhouse raises major concern over whether he can help guide Liberty Mutual through even these minor commitments let alone toward the much bigger commitments that stakeholders and advocates demand.

Moreover Hooley’s oil and gas ties are just the most egregious of several other climate conflicts on Liberty Mutual’s board with well over half of the company’s board having personal financial ties and governing and executive responsibilities tied to fossil fuel interests and extractive industries.

All this presents a stark conflict at the heart of Liberty Mutual’s governance: how are board directors like Hooley supposed to responsibly guide one of the world’s biggest insurance companies through the demands of the climate crisis while simultaneously governing over and personally profiting from the expansion of climate-destroying fossil fuel operations?

Big Oil’s Lead Director: Hooley Takes the Helm at ExxonMobil

Jay Hooley became ExxonMobil’s new lead director following the annual stakeholder meeting on May 25th 2022. In this role Hooley will be the most powerful non-executive member of Exxon’s board which oversees the entirety of the corporation’s affairs. He will practically be running the show for ExxonMobil’s governing body.

Hooley’s responsibilities will include engaging with shareholders setting the agendas for and chairing executive sessions and leading the annual performance evaluation of the board among other key functions.

In serving as ExxonMobil’s lead director Hooley will be guiding a company dedicated to expanding its oil and gas production and promoting climate denialism to stall climate action.

ExxonMobil is one of the world’s most powerful and influential corporations. The company raked in over $14 billion in profits in just the last two quarters and it has pledged to leverage those profits into billions of dollars worth of stock buybacks. In the US Exxon is expanding its oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin the busiest oilfield in the world. Because of its decades of dedication to extracting and burning fossil fuels Exxon has been a main driver of carbon emissions into our environment that have accelerated the global climate crisis.

At the same time ExxonMobil has been a leading force in climate denialism for decades. We now know that for decades Exxon knew that carbon emissions were causing climate change. Not only did Exxon suppress this knowledge but it actively promoted climate denialism and tried to stall responses to climate change.

Hooley and ExxonMobil: A Major Conflict for Liberty Mutual

Considering all this one wonders how Hooley can justify serving on the board of Liberty Mutual while at the same time being responsible for guiding the board of one of the world’s biggest oil corporations whose core business deeply conflicts with climate goals.

ExxonMobil’s most recent annual report clearly states that the company’s “principal business involves exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas.” Moreover the “risk factors” identified in the report include increased climate regulation denial of oil and gas permits new efficiency standards and other measures that we need to address the climate catastrophe. It is clear that ExxonMobil sees new climate regulation as a core threat to its business.

Hooley also faces major climate conflicts around his personal financial stake in ExxonMobil. According to Exxon’s proxy statements Hooley took in $675311 in compensation in 2020 and $214295 in 2021 for a total of $889606 in compensation over the past two years. The bulk of this compensation was awarded in the form of stock awards. According to his most recent SEC disclosure Hooley currently owns 13000 shares of Exxon Mobil stock. These shares were worth $1227200 at the close of the U.S. stock market on May 24 2022 when Exxon’s share price closed at $94.40.

All this means that as ExxonMobil and the fossil fuel industry continue to profit from oil and gas operations so will Hooley. With Hooley’s personal stake in fossil fuels how can anyone trust him to also help oversee as a board member the climate demands that must be core to Liberty Mutual’s business in the years ahead?

Moreover Hooley’s position also raises concerns over conflicts if Liberty Mutual insures any fossil fuel projects that Exxon is connected to such as pipelines refineries or other infrastructure. With Hooley’s leading role at Exxon Liberty Mutual must disclose any business it conducts with ExxonMobil and assure stakeholders that Hooley is not personally profiting from this business or otherwise abusing his director role at Liberty Mutual to benefit Exxon.

It’s also worth noting that Hooley’s location at the intersection of finance and fossil fuels is not new. Before joining the boards of ExxonMobil and Liberty Mutual he was the President and CEO of State Street Corporation generally considered the world’s third largest asset manager. State Street drew extensive scrutiny around the time of Hooley’s tenure because of its massive fossil fuel portfolio.

Ironically while leading the board of a company that thrives on extractive industry and systems dependent on fossil fuels Hooley is also a director of Aptiv a self-proclaimed green tech company – once again showing how he’s swimming in conflicts of interest.

A Conflicted Board: Liberty Mutual’s Climate Governance Problem

Hooley is not the only example of conflicts of interest at the core of Liberty Mutual’s governance when it comes to climate issues and the fossil fuel industry. As an extensive 2021 DeSmog investigation showed Liberty Mutual’s board is awash in oil and gas ties.

Today an astounding 9 out of 13 Liberty Mutual board members – a whopping 69% – have close ties to and are personally profiting from extractive industries. These include:

Annette Verschuren began her career in the coal industry with the Cape Breton Development Corporation a coal mining company and currently serves as a director of Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL). CNRL continues to extract fuel from the country’s highly polluting tar sands.

Francis A. Doyle William C. Van Faasen and David H. Long (who is also CEO and Chairman of Liberty Mutual) are all current trustees of Eversource Energy. Eversource is a massive utility in the Northeast of the US that is expanding gas infrastructure across the region. According to Eversource’s proxy filings the three directors have collectively taken in $5.5 million from Eversource during their times as directors.

Martin Slark is a board member of Koch Industries one of the largest private companies in the US that does major business in oil and gas refining petrochemicals and pipelines. The company’s owners have long fueled climate denialism and opposed clean energy.

Eric Spiegel is a director of Dover Corporation which produces multiple products for oil and gas operations. Spiegel spent years consulting for the oil and gas industry as a former Managing Partner for Global Energy Chemicals and Power at Booz & Company (now Strategy&) and Booz Allen where he “worked with major energy clients” and is a former Associate in the Energy and Industrials Practice at Temple Barker & Sloane (now Oliver Wyman). He also serves as Executive Chairman of EN Engineering “a leading engineering services firm serving the automation utility and oil and gas industries.”

Nancy Quan is Chief Technical and Innovation Officer for the Coca-Cola Company one of the world’s biggest drivers of plastic waste. In 2020 #BreakFreeFromPlastic advocacy group ranked Coca-Cola as the “#1 Top Global Polluter.” The production of plastics for use with consumer products is rooted in fossil fuel production particularly fracking. According to an investigation conducted by Greenpeace Coca-Cola buys packaging directly from manufacturers supplied with plastic resin or petrochemicals by companies like ExxonMobil.

Anne Walenski is a director of Tredegar Corporation a global manufacturer of plastic films and aluminum extrusions that goes so far to state in its most recent annual report that disruptions to petrochemical production are a big risk to its business.

These conflicts could be a reason that despite Liberty Mutual’s acknowledgement that “fossil fuels are the driving factor contributing to climate change” it does not address the imperative for ending fossil fuel expansion and phasing out coal oil and gas business in its most recent sustainability reports. Beyond its existing coal policy Liberty Mutual does not rule out insurance of new oil and gas projects nor does it outline practical timelines or steps to phase out insuring sectors that are carbon-intensive energy sectors. Liberty also does not address Indigenous rights or other human rights impacts from the projects it insures.

By contrast ten major insurers have policies restricting insurance for new oil and gas projects thirteen insurers have adopted restrictions on insuring oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and more than fifteen have restricted support for the tar sands oil sector.

What Will Liberty Mutual Do?

Companies like Liberty Mutual fuel climate change and environmental injustice when they insure and invest in fossil fuel projects and companies. Given the severity of the climate catastrophe and the imperative to limit global warming to meeting the 1.5ºC goal these firms must stop insuring fossil fuel expansion immediately phase out existing fossil fuel insurance contracts in line with 1.5ºC and divest from shares and bonds in those companies.

For Liberty Mutual the urgency of implementing such policies – or taking any real action around climate – faces conflicting pressures and interests when its board members are directly governing oil and gas companies and benefiting from the fossil fuel industry’s expansion.

Jay Hooley’s position as lead director of ExxonMobil while also serving as director of Liberty Mutual raises these exact concerns. Hooley plays a governing role for a Big Oil supermajor whose core business is in oil and gas and which sees increased climate regulation as a threat to its profits. Hooley is also personally profiting from Exxon’s business through his board compensation and stock ownership. At the same time he is playing a governing role for Liberty Mutual when the insurance giant is under pressure to take meaningful action on our climate crisis and address climate risks.

To have any real faith that Liberty Mutual can lead on climate – the most crucial issue any insurance company is facing in the midst of the climate catastrophe – the company must address the egregious climate conflicts at the core of its governance.

Michelle Lujan Grisham a one-term governor.

That candidate will also compete with Karen Bedonie of the Libertarian Party which has major party status in the state.

Although a recent Albuquerque Journal poll shows GOP candidate Mark Ronchetti with a daunting lead over his four rivals for the nomination based on a sample of 560 likely voters a small percentage of the poll's sample had already completed their ballots.

The one televised debate among the five Republican candidates was broadcast May 20 on KOAT-TV. The debate took place via Zoom co-anchor Doug Fernandez announced because visitors to KOAT's studio must be vaccinated against COVID-19 implying that at least one of the candidates was either unvaccinated or did not verify their status.

While the primary is hotly contested among the five candidates presenting themselves for the role of New Mexico's next governor they share a consensus that the southern border is an urgent priority although they tend to approach it primarily as a security issue.

For example Rebecca Dow a state Representative from Truth or Consequences opened the KOAT debate by declaring Lujan Grisham ""has opened our border to the criminal elements of the cartel. They're trafficking humans smuggling drugs and they're responsible for the abuse of countless women and children. And that's why Republicans are picking the next governor on June 7.""

New Mexico's border with Chihuahua Mexico presents a dynamic mix of security humanitarian and economic development concerns.

For instance the Lujan Grisham administration has recently highlighted work with counterparts in Mexico to improve adjacent ports of entry at Santa Teresa New Mexico and San Jerónimo Chihuahua and facilitate international trade through a joint infrastructure task force.

At the same time federal agencies are contending with record-high volumes of migration from Central and South America. In the Border Patrol's El Paso sector alone which includes all of New Mexico 143124 encounters have been reported so far this fiscal year a 56.2 percent increase from this point last year per data from Customs and Border Protection. Reported encounters across the southwest are up 67.7 percent over the same period with more than 1.2 million encounters so far this fiscal year.

When asked an open question about how they would approach the border at the debate the GOP candidates' responses examined the region exclusively through the lens of crime and law enforcement linking it to messages about domestic crime within New Mexico and support for police.

Some like Ronchetti framed it as a humanitarian crisis as well citing hopeful immigrants exploited by human smugglers. They were largely silent on international causes of migration or federal policy except in support of a Trump-era policy requiring migrants including lawful applicants for political asylum to wait outside the United States for their hearings.

For voters assessing the alternatives to Lujan Grisham's leadership on border issues particularly in the logistically crucial region of Doña Ana County and El Paso ports of entry here is a brief introduction to how the candidates are addressing the border as the primary closes.

The Republican candidates are listed in alphabetical order followed by Bedonie a former Republican who switched to Libertarian.

Jay Block

A Sandoval County Commissioner and U.S. Air Force veteran who served in Afghanistan Block has decried the Biden Administration's halt to construction of the border wall and promised to redeploy National Guard personnel to the border recalling President Donald Trump's 2018 mobilization of the Guard with the consent of then-Gov. Susana Martinez a fellow Republican.

Additionally he has proposed creating a new law enforcement agency focused on the border although few details about its function or interactions with other agencies have been presented.

Block cited a ""humanitarian crisis"" at the border in the televised debate focused on sex trafficking as well as narcotic and human smuggling.

""The southern border affects every state in the country"" he said. ""Every state is a border state because what comes through New Mexico goes throughout the country.""

Rebecca Dow

Dow has served in the New Mexico House of Representatives since 2017 and is relinquishing her seat to challenge Lujan Grisham.

A campaign advertisement this spring featured Dow on horseback strolling alongside steel bollard border fencing with sheriffs who had endorsed her campaign.

They included Sheriff Glenn Hamilton of her home county Sierra; Sheriff Warren Walter of Hidalgo County encompassing New Mexico's bootheel region and one of the busiest enforcement areas for the U.S. Border Patrol's El Paso Sector; and a Democrat Luna County Sheriff Kelly Gannaway.

Dow has strongly backed Trump's approach to the border including a vow to advocate for finishing the border wall as well as Border Patrol requests for technology and infrastructure to facilitate its activities along the border as well as a renewed National Guard deployment.

She has also repeatedly complained of an ""open borders"" policy supported by Democrats Lujan Grisham and President Joe Biden despite federal policies limiting immigration and admittance of refugees deportations and the controversial Title 42 policy requiring many asylum applicants to wait in Mexico while their cases are in process.

While Dow was a distant second to Ronchetti in the Journal poll (9 percent to his 45 percent) she appeared to be the leading alternative within the GOP field.

Ethel Maharg

The former mayor of Cuba New Mexico praised efforts in neighboring states Arizona and Texas to complete the border wall independently of the federal government at the May 20 debate.

While Maharg the executive director of the Right to Life Committee of New Mexico has placed opposition to abortion at the center of her campaign she cited her own Hispanic immigrant ancestors in calling for firm enforcement of immigration laws and protocols and expressed alarm over costs of mitigating harm from fentanyl and narcotic drugs.

""My grandfather came here legally"" she said in the debate ""and I say if you sneak across the border sorry but … we're going to put you back no discussion period.""

Maharg is the contest's underdog having polled last at the state GOP's pre-primary convention and lagged in name recognition and fundraising. The Journal poll found her with a single percentage point among the voters sampled.

Mark Ronchetti

The former KRQE-TV meteorologist meanwhile had the support of 45 percent of the respondents to the Journal poll enjoying broad name recognition from his weather reporting as well as his 2020 run for an open U.S. Senate seat.

Ronchetti returned to his television job after losing the election to Democrat Ben Ray Luján only to resign to pursue the governor's office.

Ronchetti like his rivals hammered Lujan Grisham and Biden for a ""porous"" border policy he said fails to address the needs of federal border law enforcement agencies including adequate staffing.

He also connected international narcotics trade to domestic crime across New Mexico to argue that more rigid border policies were essential to domestic peace.

His campaign website as well as campaign ads include promises to redeploy the National Guard to the area and introduce a ""Border Strike Force"" of as many as 150 officers under the state's Department of Public Safety purportedly to aim at narcotic activity in the region.

Greg Zanetti

Zanetti a retired Army National Guard brigadier general from Albuquerque and one of two military veterans in the primary (the other being Block) gently scoffed at promises of a Guard redeployment to the border.

""What's the chain of command? How are you going to integrate with Border Patrol ICE all the alphabet agencies down there? What are the communication lines? How are you going to integrate with Texas and Arizona?""

Zanetti also questioned how the mission would be funded presuming the Biden Administration would not pay for it and leave New Mexico on the hook.

Nonetheless he too spoke about the border exclusively in terms of national security and law enforcement.

Zanetti placed third in the Journal poll close behind Dow.

Libertarian Karen Bedonie

Bedonie a Navajo Nation member who lives in McKinley County initially announced her gubernatorial run as a Republican only to seek the Libertarian nomination instead.

Her only rival is write-in candidate Ginger Grider who has said Bedonie is ""not a Libertarian at all.""

The former Republican's views on several prominent issues match those of the Republicans. That includes an endorsement of finishing the border wall and strengthened law enforcement in the region.

""As a Native American"" Bedonie states on her campaign's website ""I believe in a very respectful border that will create a safe and well organized process for all involved.""

“Top Gun: Maverick” felt the need for speed at the box office this weekend.

The sequel to the 1986 blockbuster which has Tom Cruise reprise his most iconic role of Pete “Maverick” Mitchell made an estimated $124 million domestically for its three day opening weekend according to Paramount.

That not only jets past expectations which initially projected “Maverick” to make closer to $80 million but stands as Cruise’s biggest opening weekend in his more than 40-year career. It’s Cruise’s first $100 million opening weekend and the third biggest debut of the year.

Paramount said that “Maverick” is projected to make $151 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend at the US box office. If the sequel which has Cruise’s Maverick teaching a new group of Top Gun pilots lands at that number Monday it’ll be one of the highest openings ever for a Memorial Day weekend.

Globally the film has earned $248 million so far according to Paramount which said that 55% of the US total came from ticket buyers over age 35.

“Maverick” had a lot of buzz coming into this weekend with anticipation running high and reviews even higher at 97% on review site Rotten Tomatoes.

So the big weekend is a victory for Cruise Paramount (PGRE) and especially theaters.

“Maverick” was supposed to hit cineplexes in 2020 but was delayed multiple times because of the pandemic. Other theatrical films pivoted to streaming but “Maverick” waited until audiences could experience it on the big screen — a strategy Cruise was adamant about.

That strategy paid off and demonstrates that the big screen experience still matters to a large swath of consumers.

“The stellar performance of ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ marks an important turning point” Paul Dergarabedian senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR) told CNN Business. “This is a very important weekend for both the industry and Cruise who has demonstrated his undeniable star power and status as a true movie star in an era where this type of distinction has become increasingly rare.”

The other good news for “Maverick” is that it could have legs at the box office in the weeks to come. The film garnered a perfect “A+” CinemaScore and has relatively no competition at the box office until “Jurassic World: Dominion” opens in two weeks.

“‘Top Gun: Maverick’ has a clear runway” Dergarabedian added. “By the time ‘Jurassic’ hits theaters [‘Maverick’] will likely have already generated blockbuster numbers. It should enjoy a solid playability in theaters for the rest of the summer.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9jYXJzL3Jpdmlhbi1leGVjdXRpdmUtcXVpdHMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDUvMjgvY2Fycy9yaXZpYW4tZXhlY3V0aXZlLXF1aXRz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rivian executive in charge of manufacturing engineering quits in management shakeup,"1.

Welcome . . . sort of. (Photo: Facebook)

The list of don't-bring items is exhaustive and just a starting point for open-ended prohibitions that cover ""any other item deemed unsafe by venue personnel.""

It's not prison-level strictness though overlaps exist. The suburban amphitheatre naturally bans ""weapons of any kind (including pocket knives pepper spray and mace) toy or fake weapons alcohol or illegal substances.""

Ticketholders caught trying to bring a water bottle snacks or ""professional camera"" also must return that contraband to their vehicles.



(Collage: Deadline Detroit)

In all 21 categories of not-allowed items are forbidden by 313 Presents the venue's production and promotion partner ""in the interest of our guests' safety."" A sampling of what's banned to spare you a walk of shame back to the lot this outdoor music season:

Purse clutch backpack

Liquid container

Laptop tablet iPad GoPro

Camera with detachable lens

Drone (""Violations of this policy will result in possible arrest and/or confiscation."")

Selfie stick

Noisemaker

Umbrella with pointed tip

Camping chair

However rest easy if you rock out with an infant of toddler: A diaper bag and breast pump are OK as are other small medical device satchels. But teething crackers and formula bottles theoretically could be verboten along with ""outside food or beverage of any kind.""

Click here to read a three-page fact sheet on the project or find some more information below.

Project background

According to the latest U.S. Census Hamilton County is the fastest-growing county in the state. This rapid growth is expected to continue and is demanding more of Duke Energy’s local electric transmission system.

The backbone of this area’s electric system is a 230-kilovolt (kV) line that runs north to south parallel to Moontown Road/North Gray Road. This high-voltage power line is feeding the local 69-kV transmission grid which powers area distribution substations that bring electricity to homes and businesses.

Project overview

A new substation and two new 69-kV electric transmission lines will be built to help meet the growing demand for electricity in the Noblesville and Westfield areas and to help maintain the reliability and resiliency of local power lines and infrastructure.

The new substation will be built near the intersection of State Road 32 and Moontown Road/North Gray Road on land that Duke Energy purchased in 2019. Two new power lines will originate from this new substation and connect to an existing 69-kV transmission line to the south and a substation – Westfield Northeast – to the north. The new northern line will be approximately three miles long and the new southern line will be approximately two miles long depending on the final routes selected.

Construction is expected to begin in 2023 and be completed in 2024. Open house meetings will be held in June with a public comment period in July. Over the summer of 2022 the preferred route will be announced.

Preconstruction including surveying and vegetation management is expected to begin in 2023-2024. This will be followed by substation and transmission line construction. In 2025 restoration activities will include removing equipment and restoring the impacted area as closely as possible to its original condition.

A number of route segments are currently being considered for the northern and southern transmission lines. All of the route segments are available for viewing by using the “Interactive Map” feature.

Click here to view the interactive southern map

The final routes selected will be a combination of these numbered segments but will not include all of them. The route selection is based on multiple factors including public input land use land cover occupied buildings safety reliability cost and cultural natural visual and water resources. The preferred routes for the northern and southern transmission lines are expected to be announced in late summer 2022.

Duke Energy asks you to look at the potential route corridors under consideration for the two new transmission lines and leave your public comments. Duke Energy encourages feedback from the community and intends to evaluate all input received during this public comment period as part of the route selection process.

Duke Energy has prepared a sheet of frequently asked questions and answers. Click here see the document.

Northwest School of the Arts is within the boundaries of the Historic West End Green District a collaborative effort between Clean AIRE NC and the Historic West End community. Its lead organizers Ron Ross William Hughes and Mattie Marshall spearheaded the Green District after partnering with Clean AIRE NC to monitor air quality in their neighborhoods.

The US Department of Energy hails electric vehicles (EVs) as a cleaner option compared to conventional gas-powered cars due to their lower carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions. The North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources Division of Air Quality says that gas-powered vehicles emissions can lodge deep into the lungs and exacerbate health conditions like COPD heart disease asthma and diabetes.

Black Americans have worse respiratory health outcomes due to their proximity to polluted air soil and water – the lasting impact of environmental racism from housing segregation. Clean Aire NC’s environmental justice manager Daisha Williams explains “Pollution impacts us differently. If you’re exposed to air pollution you’re more likely to die from COVID.”

Marshall Ross and Hughes also led the effort to get the PoleVolt electric vehicle charging station at The Ritz at Washington Heights launched in March of this year. Marshall says she believes cleaning up the environment “is a necessity.”

“Without clean or healthy air I don’t think we can exist.”

UNC Charlotte electrical engineering professor and associate director of the Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (EPIC) Robert Cox demonstrated use of the PoleVolt to curious onlookers.

Cox said most electric vehicle charging happens at home but in a dense urban environment like Charlotte that’s less of an option.

“One big win is being able to use existing light pole infrastructure to install the charger” he said. The PoleVolt along with two other charging stations are part of a pilot program to answer questions Cox and his partners at Duke Energy have about the feasibility of bringing public charging to Charlotte.

In addition to encouraging bicycle use and walking when possible Charlotte’s public bus routes are going fully electric thanks to a $44 million dollar transportation grant from the “build back better” infrastructure bill passed last November.

The up-front costs may present a hindrance to lower-income folks who are most impacted by air pollution. Thelma Currence who grew up in the Historic West End feels conflicted.

“I definitely agree in exposing the community to more progressive thinking” she said. “But if you look at the economy of the immediate area I don’t know if many can afford or would buy an EV.”

Photographer Alvin Jacobs expressed similar thoughts.

“That Tesla over there costs $140000. Good for you but it’s expensive” he said. “It’s not for us.”

“I don’t think it’s just about cars” says Ray Addison of Go Station a New Mexico-based sustainable transportation company. “We need to take a multi-modal approach” he said.

“As the market matures we’ll see more vehicles enter the secondary market.”

Eric Zaverl of Sustain Charlotte agrees that public transportation is an important piece.

“It’s a step in the right direction but it’s just small drops in the bucket.”

According to Zaverl there are many other moving pieces to cleaning up the environment and making transportation more equitable.

“It involves the political power to influence and change things for the better trying to offer more compensation for community members’ involvement and time and getting folks educated and organized. There’s a lot of areas missing.”

Affordable housing along the corridors of public transportation to avoid gentrification and displacement are other issues that need to be addressed.

“It’s difficult to do in North Carolina because of the way our state is structured. We can’t do inclusionary zoning” Zaverl said.

Considering the war in Ukraine along with pandemic-exacerbated shipping delays and supply shortages Zaverl says “using a renewable source that’s somewhat free like solar that we can control and that’s clean” is a better option.

“Some states are using less money on highways but NC is not one of them” Zaverl said. However cities across the nation can be the leaders in policy change.

“If we start changing in urban areas where most people are living we can change things.”

Lastly there will have to be a cultural shift to adopt more renewable energy sources in the future.

“There’s a lot of people in denial with this apple pie in the sky idea of America” Zaverl said. “If you tell your kid that they’re perfect every day they’re not gonna be able to reflect and make necessary changes when they grow up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJuZXdzb25saW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDUvMjgvd2lsbWluZ3Rvbi1kb3dudG93bi1pbmMtbGVhZGVyLWhvbGx5LWNoaWxkcy1yZXNpZ25zLzk5NDg5MTUwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wilmington Downtown Inc. leader Holly Childs resigns,"The leader of Wilmington Downtown Inc. the organization charged with managing Wilmington's downtown business district resigned this week after a year and a half in the role.

Holly Childs the president and CEO of Wilmington Downtown Inc. announced her resignation in a press release from the organization Thursday. Her resignation effective immediately comes as Childs has ""chosen to return home for family reasons"" the release stated.

Wilmington Downtown Inc. manages the 70-block downtown municipal services district which the city of Wilmington established in 2016.

Childs stepped into the role in January 2021 the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on downtown's small restaurants and businesses.

At the time she told the StarNews accepting the position was ""the most significant move of my career.""

Childs was born in North Carolina attended college at Wake Forest University and vacationed in Wilmington which made accepting the position a homecoming of sorts.

As she stepped into the role Childs told the StarNews her focus was on growing businesses downtown.

""My mission – and the WDI Board’s clear direction – is to refocus the bulk of WDI’s attention and our resources on true economic development: creating new jobs and investment in our downtown"" she said.

Connecting homeless with services:4 months in pilot program continues its work to connect Wilmington homeless with services

Wilmington concerts:Even 'off nights' are good for business after booming Wilmington concert season

Throughout her time at the helm the organization continued to grapple with the impact of the pandemic on downtown Wilmington businesses.

The organization offered support to downtown business through outreach initiatives and financial assistance programs including a microloan program for struggling businesses funded by a $25000 Duke Energy donation.

WDI has also offered façade improvement grants for downtown businesses and leads efforts to ""improve the safety cleanliness and vitality of our downtown"" by managing its ambassadors program according to the organization's website.

In recent months the organization hired an outreach specialist to build relationships with downtown's homeless and connect them with needed services. The position is part of a pilot program aimed at addressing downtown homelessness and the panhandling littering and other issues that sometimes stem from the unsheltered population.

But during her tenure the organization announced the cancelation of its popular Downtown Sundown concert series which WDI had been staging for more than a decade. Downtown Sundown was last held in 2019 in a parking lot at Second and Market streets.

WDI evolved from the Downtown Area Revitalization Effort Inc. or DARE which was established in 1977 to focus on downtown improvement.

WDI is set to get $100000 next year for its service contract with the city of Wilmington according to a budget recommended to the Wilmington City Council earlier this year.

The city expects to generate more than $780000 in property taxes and fees from the municipal services district over the next fiscal year according to the budget.

Sure the Reds want nothing more than for the second half of their campaign in the Class 3A state baseball tournament to be as fruitful as the first half.

But for an Eaton team that is pursuing its second consecutive state title — and knows exactly what it will take to get it — the Reds are determined to keep the past in the past. And when they step back on the field in six days they’ll do so with the mentality of a team that still has plenty to prove and everything to gain.

With that said: boy does that recent past set up Eaton to create an even more triumphant near future.

With their 12-2 five-inning mercy rule win against second-seeded University on Saturday at Butch Butler Field the top-seeded Reds guaranteed themselves a spot in the title game next weekend.

“Ben Richter (senior leadoff batter) said it out there when we were in our postgame huddle: ‘Nothing is done yet'” Eaton coach Todd Hernandez said. “We still have games to win next weekend if we want to reach our ultimate goal. This weekend was great and it was wonderful. But we’ve still got work to do.”

The Reds won their 10th consecutive game improved to 26-2 and became the only squad in the eight-team double-elimination tournament to escape the tournament’s opening weekend undefeated.

As a result Eaton is sure to be playing in the title game June 4 at Butch Butler Field. The Reds will either play in a winner-take-all championship at 1:30 p.m. that day or — if they beat their next opponent — they will advance to the finals at 11 a.m. with two opportunities if necessary to expand on their state record with a 13th title in the program’s rich history.

At noon Friday at Butch Butler Eaton faces No. 3 Lutheran (26-2) — one of just two teams that has handed the Reds a loss this season.

In that loss against the Lions — 9-8 on May 6 in Eaton — the Reds fell behind early as they have multiple times this season. But unlike most of those other instances Eaton fell just short of staging a sizable late-game rally.

After erasing a late-game lead in their first-round win against eighth-seeded Colorado Academy on Friday the Reds appear to be distancing themselves from their slow-start tendencies.

Just like in their 17-6 second-round win against Sterling on Friday Eaton engineered an explosive start Saturday against University.

The Bulldogs grabbed an instant 1-0 lead on their first at-bat when senior River Jackson rocketed a home run 340 feet over the right-field fence.

But Reds junior pitcher Tate Smith didn’t allow University another hit until he gave up an infield single to junior Riggs Towle in the bottom of the fourth.

“I had a coach one time tell me ‘Solo home runs are your best friend'” Smith said. “Nothing was hurt and we obviously have the firepower to strike back which we did. … As the game goes on you kind of learn what pitch is a strike and what pitch you can go to in big spots. And I felt like I did that and I found a pitch that could get a ground ball.”

Smith went the distance allowing one earned run on two hits striking out eight and walking three on 81 pitches.

While Smith was sitting down batter after batter Eaton’s offense was taking lap after lap around the bases.

After a scoreless top of the first the Reds scored multiple runs in every inning.

“We had to keep tacking on because you never know … a good team like University is always capable of coming back” said Eaton senior third baseman Dirk Duncan who went 2 for 3 with a triple two RBI and a run. “And they will (come back) if you don’t step on their throat. You’ve got to stay ahead and stay (aggressive).”

Duncan and his teammates capitalized on 12 walks Bulldog pitchers yielded.

The Reds edged ahead 2-1 with two runs in the top of the second then began to pull away with four more runs in the third.

With each team’s pitchers working with a tight strike zone Smith made the necessary adjustments while a quartet of University pitchers struggled to do the same.

“We’ve beaten a lot of good teams this year and we’ve been beaten by Eaton (three) times” Bulldogs coach Casey Miller said. “We just have to find a way to get over that hump of competing better. … I would be really surprised if we don’t lay it all out there next week. These boys respond from adversity all the time. They’re used to the big moment.”

University (23-5) is one of four teams that has advanced to next weekend’s final rounds. The Bulldogs will face No. 4 Sterling (22-6) at 2:30 p.m. Friday at Butch Butler.

While University’s roster may be inclined to use Saturday’s loss as motivation heading into next weekend Eaton will likely be best served to look more toward the future than back at the highly successful weekend it just had.

Duncan said even though his team has one loss to spare he expects his squad to approach next weekend with the same mentality as the other three teams: win or go home.

“We’ve got to stay hungry with that lion’s mentality” he said. “We need to attack everything as if it’s just 0-0.”

The winner advanced to the championship game on Tuesday at 4:30 at Onondaga Community College.

Top of the 1st Morrisville Eaton strikes when Evan Baker singles through the hole to left field and James Dapson comes in to score: 1-0 Warriors.

Still in the 1st Lyme looks like it will get out of the inning but Cale Marland’s fly ball to left field is dropped and Baker scores: 2-0.

At the bottom of the 1st the bases were loaded for Lyme when Jon LaFontaine hits a shot to right center but Michael Moot makes a diving grab to end the inning.

At the top of the 2nd the Warriors add to their lead when Michael Flyzik uncorks a wild pitch and Lincoln Dapson scores: 3-0 Morrisville Eaton.

With 2 outs Nicholas Brady singles to left field. Both Jesse Soden and James Dapson score: 5-0 Morrisville Eaton.

Flyzik would strike out the side in the 3rd but 5 Lyme errors in the first 2 innings would be the difference as Morrisville Eaton beats Lyme 7-2.

The South Jeff Girls’ Lacrosse team will be in search of a Section 3 title on Tuesday night at SUNY Cortland where they will face Skaneateles for the Class D Championship and a trip to the states.

The top seeded Lady Spartans enter the contest with a 17-1 mark winners of 16 straight.

Since 2017 the Lady Spartans have been one of the most dominant teams in Section 3 posting a 62-14 record.

South Jeff Coach Jen Williams says a commitment to success from the top to the bottom of the program has been the key to the Lady Spartans continued dominance.

”I think the key is the consistency in the program all the way from youth all the way up to the varsity level. We have people that are highly involved and are preparing these kids as a whole. Not just one kid there’s several kids that are involved that we try to keep kids involved and know that every single one of them has been part of this program that contributes. It takes a village and the people that I have involved in the program are genuinely concerned for the program” said Williams.

Macha’s life and career trajectory is fascinating. He did his schooling in Calicut Chennai and Delhi. He went on to do engineering in electronics & communication from IIT-Roorkee and started work at Telco (now Tata Motors) in Pune where he was part of the team that built and launched the Indica.After 13 years with Telco he moved within the Tata Group to TCS to build an IT consulting business out of India. “It was good to engage with traditional players like Accenture IBM and still come out on top” he says.In 2006 he moved to engineering services firm Geometric as COO where he combined business and technology roles. During this time he and his wife were blessed with a daughter and Macha decided he cannot continue travelling the way he had. There were no senior roles in Indian IT and engineering services that did not have extensive travel given that most customers were overseas.So Macha took on an R&D role in Invensys a technology company that was into software industrial automation and energy controls. The role was in California. “An R&D role meant I didn’t have to travel” Macha says. In 2014 Invensys was acquired by the French energy and automation solutions company Schneider Electric. In Schneider Macha rose to be CTO of its industrial automation business. In December 2020 he took on the Eaton role.On a recent trip to India in a nearly hour-long interaction with TOI Macha spoke about the critical role the company’s India R&D team plays in driving innovation for Eaton’s global operations.Eaton is active in multiple sectors with the biggest being in electrical products. They make electrical products for a range of areas including switching circuit protection power quality and power conversion. “Which means we make everything from the smart switches and sockets that go into your home all the way up to large transformers that go into substations for substation management” Macha says.Eaton competes in the power management sector with companies like ABB Siemens and Schneider Electric. “We have the largest market share in North America” Macha says.Eaton has about 10000 engineers with 2000 of them in India. The India R&D team Macha says works on a range of areas – industrial IoT embedded firmware cloud-based architectures software associated with workstations electronics that go into making electric motors digital twins and a host of other tech. India also creates the code libraries that are used by Eaton engineers around the world.The India team does research into next-generation tech like inferential algorithms. “For example if a factory has thousands of motors you would have to use a sensor on every motor to find out what’s happening whereas with our tech you don’t need to do that instead you analyse the electrical waveforms to figure out what’s going wrong before the motor fails” Macha says.Eaton also does advanced research into material sciences in India. Their new advanced materials make things lighter cheaper and more sustainable. “For example our polymer group creates plastics that are significantly greener compared to the traditional plastics. We use them everywhere like in our switches circuit breakers and vehicle products. We infuse polymers into electric vehicle gears to make them ultra-quiet.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdGhlb3MuY29tL2Jsb2dzL2Vjb3ByZWFjaGVyLzIwMjIvMDUvZWxjYXMtd2hpdGVuZXNzLXByb3RlY3Rpb24tcHJvZ3JhbS1iaXNob3AtZWF0b24tYW5kLWJpc2hvcC1yb2hyZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The ELCA's Whiteness Protection Program: Bishop Eaton and Bishop Rohrer,"Bishop Eaton refuses to bring disciplinary charges against Bishop Rohrer. Welcome to the ELCA’s Whiteness Protection Program.

Eleven weeks after convening a Listening Panel about Bishop Megan Rohrer of the Sierra Pacific Synod ELCA Presiding Bishop Elizabeth Eaton released their “Report to the Church” on May 27. Aside from the fact that she released the statement on the Friday of a holiday weekend the content of the statement itself is disgraceful. She has refused to bring disciplinary charges against Bishop Rohrer. Instead Eaton has asked for Rohrer’s resignation due to “serious concerns that influence Bishop Rohrer’s ability to remain impactful in their role.”

Why did Bishop Eaton ask for Bishop Rohrer’s resignation?

Bishop Rohrer removed Rev. Nelson Rabell González from his call as pastor of Misión Latina Luterana on December 12 2021 the Feast Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe with no due process and no chance for appeal. Then in February Rohrer removed Rev. Rabell from the ELCA clergy roster by refusing to grant his request for “On Leave from Call” status.

The harm done to Rev. Rabell his family and the Latiné community has been as Bishop William Gohl described it “beyond the pale.”

Yet despite calls for justice from across the ELCA Bishop Eaton has decided that Rohrer’s actions “while they may be insensitive or in hindsight seen as misguided – are not automatically grounds for discipline.”

Wait what?

Invading a Latiné congregation on their high holy day (despite the repeated warnings not to do so from Rohrer’s Latina assistant) to remove their pastor is merely “insensitive”? Threatening to call the police on a Latiné father and his daughter in the worship space is simply “misguided”? Removing an Afro-Puerto Rican pastor without due process does not meet “disciplinary criteria”? My but whiteness sets the bar high doesn’t it?

It appears that Bishop Eaton has placed Bishop Rohrer in the ELCA’s Whiteness Protection Program.

Let’s examine the logic of Bishop Eaton’s statement step by step.

Racism does not warrant discipline in the ELCA

In the second paragraph Eaton insists that “A high burden of proof exists to translate allegations into substantive findings that can be presented to a disciplinary body. In this situation that high burden was not able to be met.”

Frankly that statement is disingenuous at best a lie at worst. How can she possibly make the case that Rohrer’s actions against Rev. Nelson and Mision Latina didn’t meet the standard of discipline given the evidence?

Eaton’s refusal to find grounds for discipline is a damaging “tell” on herself and the ELCA as an institution.

The fact that a pattern of grossly and demonstrably racist acts is not grounds for discipline in this church tells us all we need to know about the white supremacy upon which this denomination is based.

It also tells us a great deal about the double and triple standards of the ELCA when it comes to applying discipline to clergy and bishops especially when comparing those standards on the basis of race and ethnicity.

Remember that Rohrer’s pattern of racism was enough for the board of Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries to suspend them from membership in the LGBTQIA+ organization. So how is it that Rohrer’s behavior did not meet the “burden of proof” for discipline for Bishop Eaton? Here’s why: because the ELCA does not consider racist acts to be a sin that meets the standards for discipline.

But the absence of the letter of the law does not in any way remove the sin. It only points to the sin of institutional deficiency in confronting racist behavior within its denominational system.

Not worth our time?

Eaton also stated in that same paragraph “Moreover disciplinary proceedings that would be likely to arrive at a similar conclusion as my review are time-consuming and risk delay in the necessary healing processes that must occur.”

So what Bishop Eaton is saying is that getting the truth out and bringing justice for Rev. Nelson and the Latiné community is not worth the time of this denomination? I see. I also note the audacity of assuming that such proceedings would arrive at her same conclusion. Apparently the ELCA’s Whiteness Protection Program affords one the gift of omniscience as well.

A series of “unfortunate events”

In the third paragraph Bishop Eaton reiterates that “these unfortunate events and Bishop Rohrer’s involvement in them (do not) rise to the level of formal discipline against Bishop Rohrer.”

This is a classic white-power move: minimize the pain and cries for justice from the oppressed community. Calling them “unfortunate events” is like saying “Oopsies! Sorry you were offended!” What an insult. Call a sin what it is instead of using euphemisms to gaslight the church.

Membership in the ELCA’s Whiteness Protection Program has its privileges

In that same paragraph Eaton says that she has “asked Bishop Rohrer to attend their assembly speak and listen to their constituents and give this the prayerful consideration it deserves after which I will expect their response.”

So let me get this straight. The white perpetrator of harm gets to decide whether or not they remain in their position? And the church is being made to wait while they are allowed to continue in their role and make their decision? And the assembly has to navigate this highly unethical situation on their own?

As Rev. Hazel Salazar-Davidson wrote in her post responding to Bishop Eaton’s statement: “this action is actually putting the power back into the perpetrator’s hands. It’s their choice whether or not they submit their resignation. It’s their choice whether or not they hold space with their constituents. They were never asked to step away while the process unfolded.”

Giving Bishop Rohrer a platform for yet more abuse

Some may argue that allowing Rohrer to preside at the Sierra Pacific Synod Assembly will force them to listen to the pain they have caused. But as long as Rohrer remains in power anyone who speaks out will likely be subject to a “wellness check” placed on leave from call without cause and forced from the roster. How do we know this? They have made their intentions clear which is explained in this piece: Bishop Megan Rohrer Doubles Down on Abuse of Power with “Wellness Checks.”

Anyone who can’t possibly fathom a bishop doing such things only needs to look at what Rohrer has already done to Pastor Nelson Rabell. Also as attorney Craig Lundgren has painstakingly documented Rohrer has a pattern of unethical actions and constitutional violations with their previous congregation the former Grace Lutheran in San Francisco.

When someone shows you who they are believe them. Rohrer will use whatever means possible to keep and wield power.

As this country witnessed during the previous presidential administration malignant narcissism does not willingly relinquish power no matter how obvious the offenses and how loud the cries for justice. This is the case both for individuals and institutions. Eaton’s decision is not only naïve and foolish it gives Rohrer a platform for yet more abuse.

Failing our Lutheran theology

What makes Eaton’s statement especially outrageous is the fact that she is doing so as the Presiding Bishop of a Lutheran denomination. Our theology gives us the language by which sin is to be confronted. Martin Luther explained that the law exists to “bridle civil transgressions and then to reveal and to increase spiritual transgressions.”[i] Seminarians learn these two uses of the law as the “curb” and the “mirror.”

As a curb the law restrains evil in society and allows for civil order. As a mirror the law reflects our own sinful state showing us where we have harmed ourselves others and God thus revealing our need for Christ.

In the case of Bishop Eaton’s adjudication of the case of Bishop Rohrer she failed both uses of the law.

As I have documented in this piece not only did Rohrer violate their oath of office as an ordained minister of this church but they have been found by a secular court to be in violation of the secular law. For Bishop Eaton not to initiate a disciplinary process on either of these grounds is negligence at best complicity at worst.

Furthermore glossing over the pain of the communities of color in this denomination is a way to fog the mirror so we can’t see ourselves for who we truly are. And I write this as a white ordained Lutheran pastor knowing that I must constantly keep that mirror in front of myself as well.

Tried to be Solomon got Pilate instead

In her statement it appears that Bishop Eaton was aspiring to a Solomonic approach: seemingly wise judicious and threading the needle between two factions. Unfortunately this statement places her squarely in the shoes of Pilate. She is in essence washing her hands of responsibility for the whole mess and leaving it to the uproarious crowd to figure out.

Such a stance seeks to position itself as above the fray while being “deeply concerned” in a Sen. Susan Collins kind of way. Instead by taking no action to enact justice for the Latiné community Eaton has proven true the worst fears of those who have suspected the white supremacist underpinnings of the ELCA. The result is the continued crucifixion of clergy and congregations of color.

Bishop Eaton’s statement is nothing more than whiteness clutching its pearls and patting itself on the back for talking the talk instead of walking the walk. This statement is about protecting the institutional church from litigation instead of protecting historically marginalized black and brown clergy and congregations from abuse. Her words give yet more evidence of what I have called the “Corporate Captivity of the ELCA.”

What about the report of the Listening Panel?

If Bishop Eaton was truly committed to transparency she would release the report of the Listening Panel to the public. Instead she withholds it on grounds of “confidentiality.” Not only is this a euphemism for toxic institutional secret-keeping it is also a red herring. A redacted report anonymizing the parties involved could easily be sent out.

But Eaton will not do this. Why? Likely because what the Listening Panel discovered is incriminating not just of Bishop Rohrer but of those who enabled their behavior and are complicit in what led up to Dec. 12 and the “unfortunate events” that followed.

In short releasing the Listening Panel’s report could implicate many individuals in positions of power and threaten the stability of the entire ELCA.

So Eaton is choosing to preserve stability.

But here’s the problem with that choice. Preserving the institutional church means sacrificing the oppressed who have borne the brunt of the ELCA’s racist policies. This report provides further confirmation that the churchwide office cares nothing about them. Paying lip service to “healing” by promising “anti-racism training“ and “cultural sensitivity training” amounts to hollow words of empty promises. It reeks of lawyerly language designed to avoid exposing the church to litigation rather than following the gospel of Jesus Christ that promises resurrection – but only after we have died to our sinful institutional self.

What’s more calls for removing Bishop Eaton are proliferating across social media. There is talk of calling for a vote of no confidence in her leadership at the Churchwide Assembly in August. Is it really worth falling on one’s sword to protect and uphold white supremacy in the church?

Luther’s mirror is cracking

When I learned of the Roman Catholic Church covering up the scandal of priests abusing children I must admit I felt a bit smug. At least the Lutheran church doesn’t systematically cover up abuse I told myself.

When evidence emerged this past week of the Southern Baptist Convention covering up the scandal of sexual abuse and misconduct it’s likely that many Lutherans also felt a bit smug. At least the Lutheran church doesn’t systematically cover up abuse many probably thought to themselves.

But it’s time for ELCA Lutherans to hold up Luther’s mirror and see the truth of our denomination. One of the reasons racism is rampant is because it has never been codified as an offense that can lead to discipline in the ELCA – not for congregation members not for churches not for rostered ministers and certainly not for bishops.

By refusing to initiate a disciplinary procedure many people are being excused and protected from consequences of this whole fiasco that began back in 2018. Pastor Nelson’s accuser and her spouse. His former senior pastor and congregation. His former bishop and current bishop. Bishop Eaton herself. All of them are implicated by this scandal of systemic racism. As it stands Bishop Eaton is covering for the abusers and the institution instead ministering to the people she’s charged with protecting.

Benefits of the ELCA’s Whiteness Protection Program

Here’s the real kicker about the ELCA’s Whiteness Protection Program. By not bringing disciplinary charges against Rohrer even if Rohrer does step down they are still free to serve a congregation or in any leadership capacity in any synod. Thus some other church(es) will be subjected to Rohrer’s tyranny in the future and the abuse will continue.

Ah yes membership in the ELCA’s Whiteness Protection Program has its privileges.

There is no healing without truth and reconciliation

Bishop Eaton indicated that she plans to “visit the Sierra Pacific Synod and request time with the people of Iglesia Luterana Sta. María Peregrina (formerly known as Misión Latina Luterana) the Synod Council and synod staff to consider steps toward healing.” But she of all people should know by now that there can be no healing without a full investigation truth-telling confession repentance and reparations.

What the ELCA needs is a version of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission to come to terms with its long history of racism especially against its own clergy and congregations.

If the congregation of Santa María does meet with Bishop Eaton I hope they make it crystal clear that Eaton’s inaction has made the pain of Rohrer’s actions that much worse. This is especially the case given that she knew exactly what was coming down the pike — because Rev. Rabell told her what was happening to him back in November of 2021 (read the whole timeline here.)

What now?

The only thing good that can be said about Eaton’s statement is that she has likely eroded public support for Rohrer by publicly calling for them to step down. But we can surmise that this public call means that the private request did not yield the intended result.

If Bishop Rohrer refuses to step down the synod constitution delineates four possible ways that disciplinary procedures can be initiated.

1) The Synod Council on an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of its elected members present and voting.

2) The Synod Assembly on an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of its members present and voting.

3) At least 10 synod bishops.

4) The presiding bishop of this church.

Eaton has reneged on her constitutional duty so that eliminates #4.

As for #2 and #3 the Sierra Pacific Synod Assembly is coming up on June 2. Synod Council Members and the Assembly can choose to pick up that mirror cracks and all to see the truth reflected there. And then they can choose to “bridle the transgressions” as Luther put it.

However given Rohrer’s hold on both the Synod Council and the assembly the first two options are unlikely. Therefore it will be up to the Conference of Bishops to initiate a disciplinary process against Rohrer. They are the denomination’s best hope for both the mirror and the curb of the law.

May God’s will for truth accountability and justice prevail.

Author’s update June 7 2022

Megan Rohrer is no longer bishop of the Sierra Pacific Synod of the ELCA. The Listening Team Report was finally released on June 1 which you can read here. Following the contentious Synod Assembly an announcement was released on Mon. June 5 that Bishop Eaton and the Conference of Bishops initiated a disciplinary process against Rohrer. Rohrer subsequently released a statement that they had resigned from the position of Bishop. This is a developing story which I will address in future posts.

‍""Forty years ago I was grateful to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated it was a monumental moment in my life"" says Wayne Gretzky Sportsman of the Year. ""I'm honored to bring this collectible experience to my hockey fans who have followed my career for decades.”

There are 13 limited-edition digital collectibles as green gold platinum and diamond tier NFTs ranging from a highly coveted 15 editions only in the diamond tier to 299 editions each in the green tier. With prices starting at $10 each NFT features a 3D rendering of Gretzky making a signature move on the ice. As part of OneOf's sports legends NFT series additional releases will be available on eBay throughout 2022.

BSC News reached out to eBay to find out what they think about NFTs. eBay provided us with an exclusive statement as follows:

“For 26+ years eBay has been the world’s destination for collectibles connecting millions of buyers with sellers and bringing unmatched inventory to the marketplace –particularly the most unique and hard-to-find items. And while collectibles were once viewed as simply just enthusiasts' passions they are now being recognized by a broader audience as serious business opportunities and key investments. In recent years NFTs and blockchain technology have entered the collectibles space and continue to revolutionize it. NFTs offer greater access to a broader audience of collectors and creators.”‍

This collection was developed in partnership with environmentally friendly NFT platform OneOf which provides sustainable collections through multiple ""energy-efficient blockchains."". OneOf's CEO Lin Dai also shared his excitement about the recent drop with a tweet:

The statement from eBay also talks about the recent partnership with OneOf:

“Digital publishing brought more exposure for writers digital collectibles bring greater opportunity for artists creators collectors and investors. eBay’s partnership with OneOf is a natural evolution as we increasingly see enthusiasts investing differently and looking for innovative ways to build their collections.”

As of mid-2021 eBay began offering NFT listings but has not yet incorporated blockchain technology to support sales on its marketplace as reported by Turner Wright from Cointelegraph. With this official drop users will receive redemption links via in-platform messaging or email to access their NFT outside of the platform.

NFTs were minted on Ethereum scaling platform Polygon and sales were conducted on eBay's Web2 platform rather than on-chain. At the time of writing about 2900 items are already been sold. You can check the Genesis NFT collection from eBay here.

It’s hard not to like a C2 Corvette even when it’s been sitting in a garage gathering dust for nearly 30 years like this customized Sting Ray that even had boxes of junk piled on it.

The car recently was rescued by a new owner who acquired it from the family of the second owner who had bought it in 1970 and used it as a street/strip car – hence the big rear slicks rear fender flares and glassed-over headlights that were common in that era. He eventually gave the car to his son in the 1980s and he installed a Corvette 1965 date code 327/300 horsepower HO code engine with a Turbo 350 automatic transmission so his wife could drive it too.



The car eventually wound up being stored inside a garage by 1993 where it had remained until recently and now it’s offered for sale on eBay. Fortunately that dry storage likely helped preserve the frame which seems to be in decent shape with only surface rust.

Eager to see if the engine would still run the seller installed points condenser and a coil and it did indeed fire right up using a jug of fuel after priming the motor first – with no smoke or leaks. He described the experience as “unreal” noting that bird’s nests and more came out of the exhaust when it was first cranked up but after that the engine showed 60 pounds of oil pressure and “sounded excellent for sitting that long.”



Since then he’s also installed a new master cylinder and brakes and has a new gas tank ready for a new owner to install. He believes it wouldn’t take much to drive the car as it sits but emphasizes “this is not something you can come and drive around the block just so we are clear … but with a new gas tank new tires and a few odds and ends it should be very driveable.”

He believes it would be a good candidate for an LS or LT4 conversion.



This ’65 left the St. Louis factory in the second most popular paint color that year Glen Green with a white interior and black soft top. At some point though it was repainted in its current shade of black and black bucket seats were installed though the door panels remain the original white.

While it’s likely a new owner would want a new paint job the seller points out that he buffed a small area and “for being done in the ’80s it shined up amazingly well” adding “not that it’s gonna make the car but I bet if you wet sanded a little and buffed it would be a big improvement from the pics.”



Overall he says the body isn’t “all cracked up” and features good fit and seams and the trim is “amazingly well preserved” and just needs a good polishing to look “nice” too. And “whoever did the flares did a good job back in the day [because] they are not all cracked up like most” he adds.

In a further note of encouragement he says that “it’s real easy to pull the body off these Mid Years and do the frame and suspension and paint it unlike most.”



The odometer shows 44000 miles which the seller “would pretty much bet anything” is correct.

In an addendum to the ad the seller points out that the original tinted windshield and the rest of the glass remain in “excellent shape.” While the convertible top frame works “great” he believes the ragtop is original and needs to be replaced.

OLD gaming consoles might seem like bulky hunks of plastic but some devices carry shocking re-sale value.

eBay sellers are pulling in real dollars for their old consoles - you can too by listing some of these tech fossils.

8 Find out if your old consoles are worth more online than they are in your attic

""The game had to almost be able to play itself so that people would know what was happening."" Atari co-founder and founding father of video gaming Nolan Bushnell once said. ""So that was how ‘Pong’ was formed.""

Pong was one of the first games to graduate from the large boxy arcade form to a home console in 1975 - it's so simple even a monkey can play Pong.

Don't bet the farm on your Pong profits - a used but functional 1976 Pong console is on the eBay market for $99.99.

The introduction of the Nintendo 64 was an inflection point in the gaming industry - the console introduced 3D graphics and four-player capabilities for the first time.

Over the years Nintendo released regional and limited editions of the console in swanky colors and emblazoned with 1990s cultural icons like Pikachu.

The rarest of the rare will fetch over six digits on eBay - but the standard black N64 system is worth about $50.

In 2004 the 24k gold Game Boy was issued in a contest with just six winners out of 25000 candidates - in the years since the gold-dipped handheld has been shrouded in secrecy with some wondering if the device even exists.

A seventh gold console was produced for a Zelda trivia giveaway hosted by GamesTM but the winner never publicized their score.

If you have one you can essentially set your own price as one has never been verifiably seen or sold in public.

The Xbox is a device where the condition of the product is a major factor in pricing.

A factory sealed original Xbox is going for over $7000 on eBay - to draw in thorough potential buyers the seller noted the console was stored in a ""smoke and pet free home"".

Meanwhile a complete Xbox system will go for a hair below $150 - for buyers there's a sweet deal for a worn but functioning Xbox with two controllers and 36 games thrown in for $230.

Beatles purists look away!

A 2009 limited edition Beatles-inspired version of Rock Band included a controller modeled after Paul McCartney's Hofner bass and a drum kit with the iconic Beatles branding.

Sellers with unopened kits are asking for up to $700 for their merchandise - but used individual pieces of the set can still go for north of $100.

Xbox president Phil Spencer said the Xbox Series X is Microsoft's fastest selling console of all time - meanwhile the Playstation 5s are flying off the shelf faster than Sony can build them.

The game developed by the renowned team at Respawn will expand on the legendary Star Wars storylines landscapes characters and exhilarating action first seen in the series’ inaugural release Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor undergoes development on Playstation 5 PC and Xbox Series X|S. This provides a more immersive and expansive experience for all types of worldwide gamers when it comes in 2023. Respawn announced the sequel earlier this year in January.

Cal Kestis returns to the Star Wars universe as will we when we get to play as him. As usual he’s fighting for the good side of the force with the assistance of his nice droid aide BD-1. Jedi: Fallen Order is about Cal as he strives to rebuild the Jedi after the tragic Order 66. The sequel comes five years after the events of the first game. It’s characterized as a third-person narrative-driven action-adventure game. According to director Stig Asmussen the sequel will also have certain next-generation features most notably ray-tracing capability and speedier load times.

What Did We See In The Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Trailer?

Source: StarWars.com

In the video Cal meets a Pau’an (the long-limbed humanoids that Obi-Wan encounters on Utapau). That is significantly the same species as the Grand Inquisitor—the commander of the Jedi hunters who served under Darth Vader. So this may be the Grand Inquisitor but given his position in other Star Wars storylines it seems improbable.

Cal also encounters a one-armed cloaked creature holding a red lightsaber and an unusually pale figure in a bacta tank. We also see Cal’s new lightsaber which is not the one he used at the end of Fallen Order. This new saber only has one blade and cannot be split into two lightsabers. This hints that Cal may lose his original saber at the start of Survivor and must build a new one.

Comments About The Game From The Minds Behind It

“Even before completing Jedi: Fallen Order our team had a vision of how to carry the adventure for Cal BD and the crew into the sequel” said Stig Asmussen game director Respawn. “For Jedi: Survivor we are working in lockstep with Lucasfilm Games to build on the legacy of Jedi: Fallen Order. We’re leveraging advanced technology to create more dynamic Jedi combat and cinematic storytelling to expand on Cal’s story as he matures and survives during the dark times. We can’t wait to share more about the game with the world later this year.” “Millions of Star Wars fans have been captivated by the story of Cal Kestis and we’re thrilled to be working with the world-class developers at Respawn to continue this epic tale” said Douglas Reilly vice president Lucasfilm Games. “We could not be more excited to reveal Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and this next chapter of Cal Kestis’ journey with players around the world.”

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an upcoming Star Wars video game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. On January 25 2022 it was formally unveiled alongside a strategy game and a first-person shooter. Previously EA revealed a new Star Wars game in development at a 2019 investor call with a 2022 release date scheduled. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor comes out in 2023 for the Xbox Series X|S PlayStation 5 and PC.

This legend-based shooter game is built on the PC/console counterpart and is designed with touchscreens in mind. It brings streamlined controls and thoughtful optimizations on both Android and iOS devices and has a few features that are absent from the PC version. Like other shooting games such as COD Mobile and BGMI Apex Legends also comes with support for a gyroscope and controller which by default is disabled. In our guide we will explain how to enable and configure the gyroscope in Apex Legends Mobile.

How does the Gyroscope work in Apex Legends Mobile

The gyroscope function lets you move the reticle by moving the phone instead of swiping with your finger. This way aiming is much more easier and efficient. For instance you can increase the sensitivity by moving the aim very quickly with your fingers and then using the gyroscope for better aiming because sensitivity would otherwise be too high.

Image via Electronic Arts

The ability to move with fingers isn’t affected. The left joystick will still move you forward backward and side-to-side. The right side swiping turns your camera. It gives the ability to turn on the camera by spinning or turning your phone. It acts more like a second joystick. The best success can be found by enabling a gyroscope with ADS only as it can mess up during combat if you aren’t used to it.

How to enable and disable the gyroscope in Apex Legends Mobile

1. From the lobby tap on the Settings option in the bottom left corner of the screen.

Image via Electronic Arts

2. Move to the “Sensitivity” settings from the right sidebar.

3. Tap on the gyroscope option.

Image via Electronic Arts

4. There is two option you can either enable On while ADS which only enable it while aiming down sights or Always On which lets you enable it all the time.

How to disable the Gyroscope

Follow up the same steps and turn the gyroscope off by clicking on the off option instead of on.

How to configure the Gyroscope in Apex legends Mobile

There are a few options and settings which you can change according to your preference:

Invert Horizontal control: It flips movement on the X-axis of the camera.

It flips movement on the X-axis of the camera. Invert vertical control: It flips movement on the Y-axis of the camera.

Gyroscope overall sensitivity scale: This is a baseline sensitivity setting the higher you increase this setting the more sensitive would be the camera movement.

This is a baseline sensitivity setting the higher you increase this setting the more sensitive would be the camera movement. Gyroscope vertical sensitivity scale: This is the same as overall sensitivity but it affects the Y-axis ( up and down).

This is the same as overall sensitivity but it affects the Y-axis ( up and down). Linked sensitivity adjustment: Every sensitivity setting below this one has two separate settings one for aiming and one for shooting. This option adjusts the two parts together simultaneously.

This is used in the third person mode when not aiming down sights. 1X-10X optic ADS: This is used to zoom the gyroscope according to personal preference.

The Gyroscope sensitivity setting depends more on personal preference. By default the game has higher sensitivity at lower zoom levels and lower sensitivity at higher zoom levels. That’s not a bad option because you’ll want more fine-tuning options with a sniper than you would with a shotgun.

One of the most popular events in the FIFA Mobile calendar recognizes the best performers from each league season. This year we have an event packed with challenges rewards and of course brand new cards. With so much choice available picking the best option takes a bit of thinking. We’re here with the TOTS Player reviews where we look at each of the FIFA Mobile 22 TOTS starters from the major leagues starting with the Premier League analyzing their playstyles and detailing their pros and cons.

The second league of the FIFA Mobile 22 TOTS event is the Premier League. A selection of players was selected from the top flight of English football and with a community vote a squad was chosen. The league’s top 2 sides Manchester City and Liverpool took the spotlight contributing 8 out of 11 starters whilst Manchester United and Tottenham representatives filled the remaining slots.

All those calculations. All that time. All that effort. It all comes down to this. Choose wisely!

FIFA Mobile 22 Premier League TOTS Players

João Cancelo (LB)

Overall: 94

94 Requirement : 28000 TOTS Community Points

: 28000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Balanced

Overview

João Cancelo was an important player behind Manchester City‘s title charge. He made 50 appearances for his team in all competitions creating 10 goals and popping another 3 in himself. The Portuguese can play as a wingback on either side and is known for his ball control and passing ability.

VSA

As a more attacking-focused wing-back Cancelo isn’t especially a thorn in defense but he can cause some problems with his catch-up speed. On the flip-side his dribbling ability comes in handy for attacking chances and Cancelo’s long shots were surprisingly decent as well.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

Defensively Cancelo appears quite solid but you will want him pushing up as often as possible. He is a great dribbler especially in small spaces and has a killer pass to create chances. In addition Cancelo is a dependable defender and can catch up to most wingers quite well. Inverted wing-backs aren’t common but they are actually quite useful in some situations and are quick to get used to too. Overall this is a very good attacking left-back that does exactly what is expected.

Bruno Fernandes (CAM)

Overall: 94

94 Requirement : 28000 TOTS Community Points

: 28000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Counter

Overview

In an underwhelming Manchester United side there were few positives to take away. However looking at the numbers it seems as though the Red Devils would have been worse off if it wasn’t for Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese Midfielder recorded 10 goals and 6 assists in the league contributing to more than a quarter of his team’s goals all season.

VSA

This card genuinely has everything to be a very useful goalscorer for VSA. Bruno has the shot power accuracy and ball control of a lethal attacker but the 3* weak foot brings the quality of this card down. As a central player the ball will definitely fall to Bruno’s left at some point. Nonetheless if this can be managed then Bruno could be a great addition to the team.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

Because of his playmaking and finishing ability Bruno is a great option for H2H. He will operate towards the edge of the opposition 3rd taking long shots and playing passes in and around the box. The only other downside (apart from the weak foot) is his pace though that will rarely make a difference to his role on the pitch anyway. On the whole Bruno is a useful CAM that can both score and create – although the 3* weak foot is very limiting.

Trent Alexander-Arnold (RB)

Overall: 95

95 Requirement : 42000 TOTS Community Points

: 42000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Pace

Overview

After a fairly underwhelming season prior Trent hit back into double digits with 2 goals and 12 assists in 31 league games. He only just missed out on the PL Golden Playmaker award too with teammate Salah beating Trent by one assist. The 23-year-old is regarded as one of the best passers in the league or even the world with his crosses and long balls often resulting in chances for teammates.

VSA

Trent is a decent defender for VSA – not a complete pain to get past but not useless either. He can time tackles well and can recover quickly when stunned. In attacking chances he contributes fine as well. Trent feels very smooth on the ball and his shots have decent power on them too.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

Crosses are not as useful as they have been in previous seasons but Trent still does his job as an attacking RB. His passing range looks great and he is fluid when on the ball. With the skill boost being Pace this card can get really fast which is basically the icing on the cake. All in all Trent is the ideal attacking RB that does a solid job for the team.

Bernardo Silva (CM)

Overall: 95

95 Requirement : 42000 TOTS Community Points

: 42000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Vision

Overview

Bernardo Silva played as one of the best players in the league at one point this season. He established himself as a key player in Guardiola‘s plans making 34 league appearances and registering 8 goals and 4 assists. Bernardo is known to be a versatile player who can function in midfield and anywhere across the front three. Few other players in England have the dribbling and passing ability to match Bernardo Silva.

VSA

Because of how fluid he feels on the ball Bernardo Silva is a great player for VSA. He keeps the chances flowing and momentum running which is very important for this mode. His shots are also impressive for a midfielder. The 3* weak foot isn’t ideal but it isn’t that big of a drawback for this position.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

Generally this card performs well in 90-minute matches. Bernardo is a great playmaker and also a great ball-carrier. The only issue arises when Bernardo gets outnumbered or outpowered in midfield. He really lacks a presence on the pitch and gets pushed around easily. The best solution is to play him in a three-man midfield where he can push forward without creating problems behind him.

All things considered Bernardo is a very fun card to use because of his silky ball control and accurate passing. However his lack of strength causes him to be overrun at times so surrounding Bernardo with good defensive support is key to getting the most out of him.

Alisson Becker (GK)

Overall: 96

96 Requirement : 67000 TOTS Community Points

: 67000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Number 1

Overview

Liverpool‘s solid defense was one of the big reasons why they won two trophies this season and almost clinched the league title as well. Alisson has been a key part of that defense and he certainly helps brings his side up a few levels. This season he contributed to 20 clean sheets in 36 appearances.

VSA

Goalkeepers have been weird in this FIFA Mobile season. It seems like a well-powered shot will result in a goal regardless of who is in the opposition goal. For Alisson it’s the same case. Whilst he is secure with the basic shot-stopping Alisson struggles with long-shots powered shots and well-placed finesse shots – basically the things most keepers tend to struggle with within this mode.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

Again the weird case of underperforming goalkeepers applies here as well. This card doesn’t have anything in its shot-stopping that separates it from other keepers. Looking elsewhere though Alisson does have a decent distribution which improves with the skill boost and the Long Throw trait is worth making use of. In conclusion this card is not much different from most other goalkeepers on the market. His shot-stopping is decent at best although Alisson’s distribution is not bad and can be of use in H2H.

Rúben Dias (CB)

Overall: 96

96 Requirement : 67000 TOTS Community Points

: 67000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Defending

Overview

Dias only managed to start 27 out of 38 games in the Premier League this season due to injury. However he was an important player whenever he played bringing leadership and stability to the backline. In addition Dias also bagged 2 goals and a further 4 assists – the most goal contributions in a league season in his senior career.

VSA

The stats look great and that transfers over to in-game performance. Dias is a really tough defender to get past. Physically he is very big and barely moves when dribbled into. Furthermore the times he tackles well and recovers quickly if dribbled past too. He also marks other players well cutting out passing options and just making chances harder to complete.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

Dias’ standing and sliding tackles work really well and hardly result in fouls. Because of his strength Dias can push opposition attackers off the ball quickly when pressing. For a back three Dias slots nicely into the middle as his lack of speed hurts if he’s on the edges. In a back two having a quick RB/CDM will be useful too. To conclude Dias is a really solid defender especially for VSA. His speed is an issue for H2H though with a bit of squad tinkering this can be hidden away.

Heung-min Son (LW)

Overall: 97

97 Requirement : 111000 TOTS Community Points

: 111000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Ball Control

Overview

Heung-min Son scored twice on the last day of the Premier League to come level with Salah for the Golden Boot. He scored 23 times including no penalties and set up a further 7 goals for his teammates. The winger is known as one of the toughest attackers to play against in the league and his movement and finishing have proven to be devastating.

VSA

Son basically has everything a good attacker needs in VSA. Pace dribbling shooting 5* weak foot – this is a complete winger and a good one too. It’s difficult to point out a drawback for this mode since there really isn’t any. This is easily one of the best left-wingers in the game.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

Again this card looks flawless. Son feels smooth on the ball and has the finishing prowess and the speed to beat defenders. On top of that he makes good runs forward tracks back often and has a decent bit of stamina to back that as well. In summary Son is the ideal LW for any team. Although he is very costly he ticks all the boxes for his position and there are few players in the game that can do that.

Virgil van Dijk (CB)

Overall: 97

97 Requirement : 111000 TOTS Community Points

: 111000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Strength

Overview

After a season plagued with injuries Van Dijk was back in the Liverpool starting lineup for the 21/22 campaign. Instantly the defense went up a few levels; they kept 21 clean sheets this term in comparison to just 12 prior when Van Dijk was injured. The Dutchman is known as one of the best CBs in football consistently performing at the highest levels.

VSA

As expected Van Dijk is a really strong defender both in ability and physicality. His tackles are well-timed and his reactions are quick so it’s a challenge getting past him. Even when Van Dijk does get stunned he turns and gets back quickly to press the attacker. One thing to note though Van Dijk’s positioning has looked slightly off at times. He often arrives into the box to defend rather than being there in the first place.

H2H

Because of his pace and passing range Van Dijk is the complete defender for H2H. He has a great presence both on the ground and aerially and is almost unbeatable in 1-on-1 duels. Van Dijk could easily play in any CB role but partnering him with a fully-defensive CB could be useful as this would allow Van Dijk to carry the ball a bit more and make use of his long passing. To summarise Van Dijk is as good as his stats suggest. He is a complete CB and is in that elite-level category.

Mohamed Salah (RW)

Overall: 98

: 163000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Agility

Overview

At the start of the season there was never a debate about who was the best player in the league at that point. Salah was literally scoring/assisting every game and blanked only once for 17 matches in a row. He ended the season as the joint top-scorer and top assister with 23 goals and 13 assists.

Salah has an incredible shot which is backed by his quality ball control to make space for the finish. He has good strength over the ball as well which combined with his speed makes Salah a deadly dribbler. If only he had the 5* weak foot that would top it off so nicely. Nonetheless this is still easily one of the best right-wingers on the market.

Kevin De Bruyne (CAM)

Overall: 98

98 Requirement : 163000 TOTS Community Points

: 163000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Dribbling

Overview

De Bruyne was recently named the Premier League Player of the Season after yet another stellar season with Manchester City. This season he recorded 15 goals and 8 assists in just 25 start to help guide City to their 6th Premier League title. Usually known for his elite playmaking De Bruyne was much more precise with his finishing this campaign scoring his best season tally for goals in his senior career.

De Bruyne has a magnificent card for this FIFA Mobile 22 Premier League TOTS. With great finishing dribbling technique and that lovely 5* weak foot this card is perfect for VSA. For H2H De Bruyne’s passing ability is brilliant both at shots and long-range. Some of the through balls this card pulls off doesn’t even seem possible beforehand. He genuinely ticks all the boxes and is the model for a perfect CAM in any mode.

Cristiano Ronaldo (ST)

Overall: 98

98 Requirement : 173000 TOTS Community Points

: 173000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Second Striker

Overview

Despite being 37 years of age Ronaldo is still out getting 20+ goal contributions in one of the most competitive leagues in the world. The Portuguese legend scored 18 times this season and tallied another 3 assists. Ronaldo guided Manchester United to a top 6 finish and it’s evident that his team would have been much worse off without his performances.

Ronaldo is the perfect mold for a Target Man striker. He has a very powerful and accurate shot which when combined with his technical ability makes him lethal inside the final 3rd. He has a great aerial presence and is quite smooth on the ball too despite his tall build. An upgrade to the weak foot would absolutely complete this card but regardless this is still a great and fun card to use.

The company that breeds research rodents has applied for tax abatements from Wayne County and Wayne County Council's tax abatement committee reviewed the requests Thursday morning.

Taconic plans construction of a new barrier building that provides a controlled environment for the rodents at its Gateway Industrial Park location in Cambridge City where it has been located more than 15 years. It already received county drainage board approval for the project.

Development:Land purchases will create Midwest Industrial Park's 3rd phase

According to the application the building's construction cost is estimated at $4.6 million. Taconic also expects to invest $690000 to equip the building and to create 11 new jobs with pay totaling $450000.

A tax abatement provides real estate or personal property tax relief on new investments through a 10-year period. The relief begins at 100% the first year and decreases by 10 percentage points each subsequent year.

Tony Gillam the committee's chair said Taconic plans to begin its construction project this month and conclude construction during March 2023. Equipment installation will occur through June 2023.

Eli Lilly's announcement Wednesday that it will invest $2.1 billion to expand its manufacturing in Boone County bodes well for Taconic's future Gillam noted saying Lilly is a major Taconic customer.

Gillam Cathy Williams and Max Smith unanimously voted to recommend that the full council approve Taconic's abatement requests.

Thursday's committee meeting also included annual compliance reviews for three companies with current tax abatements. The committee unanimously voted to recommend council find all three companies in compliance.

Taconic has an abatement granted during 2019 on a $612000 equipment investment. The plan included adding four jobs although Taconic has struggled to find additional employees. Payroll however has increased by $368000 according to the filed statement of benefits.

ITD Engineering at 5626 New Paris Pike received abatements in 2020 and 2021. The first project resulted in a $271939 investment and 12 new jobs and the second project included a $1.2 million investment and 11 new jobs.

Sugar Creek Packing Company has one active real estate abatement and five active personal property abatements for its Gateway Industrial Park location. It assumed the real estate abatement from Really Cool Foods then received personal property abatements in 2015 2017 2018 2019 and 2020.

The company's current 545 employees with a payroll exceeding $27 million surpasses the original target of 400 employees.

Smith said Sugar Creek has been an asset to the county and has far exceeded expectations.

Sugar Creek's most recent investments are being hampered by supply chain problems Gillam said causing its investment to fall short of expectations. However that shortfall provides room for a new planned investment of $13280000 by the end of the year without need for an additional abatement.

Gillam does expect a Sugar Creek abatement request on a planned $17 million investment for next year.

""It's a company that has just continued to invest year after year in their plant"" Gillam said. ""It's real exciting for Wayne County that we have somebody as proactive and growing at the rate that they do.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%

Dividend Kings keep getting more attractive as the stock market seems shakier with every passing day. Inflation war interest rate hikes and slumping earnings. There’s plenty to be worried about.

As any study of long-term investing will show it’s time in the market that makes the difference. Investors have to keep capital in stocks to get the benefits of long-term compounding. With that in mind investors have to find stocks and construct a portfolio that can withstand recessions and bear markets.

There’s no better place to look for such resilient companies than the Dividend Kings. These are the companies that have increased their dividends for at least 50 years in a row.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As you might imagine there aren’t too many firms that have managed to make it to Dividend King status. In fact there are just 44 as of this year. For this article we’ll take it one step further going for companies with 60+ years of consecutive dividend hikes.

These seven Dividend Kings have proven that they can provide a growing income stream regardless of economic conditions.

AWR American States Water $79.69 DOV Dover Corp $134.55 KO Coca-Cola $64.68 EMR Emerson Electric $88.40 MMM 3M $149.51 NWN Northwest Natural $54.25 CL Colgate-Palmolive $78.86

American States Water (AWR)

at 67 years

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 67

At 67 years in a row American States Water currently has the longest-running consecutive dividend increase streak of the S&P 500 companies.

It’s not too hard to see why. Water utilities are among the most stable businesses out there. Regardless of what is going on with the economy people need fresh clean water.

Story continues

American States Water has been able to leverage that consistent demand into a solid growth rate with earnings per share increasing around 7%/year annually over the past decade.

In turn American States Water has increased its dividend by a similar amount annually as well. AWR stock offers a dividend yield of 1.9% which is certainly not the highest on this list.

However its unmatched record in terms of how long it has delivered annual dividend hikes and the inherent stability of its underlying business make American States Water a solid defensive Dividend King.

Dover Corp (DOV)

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 66

Dover is a diversified industrial company. It operates in a wide variety of segments including imaging and ID services pumps climate and sustainability technologies and engineered products.

Dover is not a particularly glamorous business but it keeps steadily ticking along. Earnings have grown 5% per year annualized over the past decade which has given it sufficient margin to keep increasing its dividend.

DOV stock is also a timely pick right now. Shares are down nearly 25% year to date. This has led DOV stock to sell at just 15 times forward earnings which is near its cheapest valuation of the past decade.

As with many Dividend Kings Dover is not the sort of company that will make anyone a fortune overnight but this steady industrial company serves as a top-notch growth and income machine over the long term.

Coca-Cola (KO)

Coca-Cola is one of Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks and it’s not hard to see why. The company sells almost $40 billion in soda and other beverages each and every year.

Regardless of what happens with the economy or political conditions Coca-Cola continues to sell the same amount of refreshments.

Soda isn’t much of a growth industry anymore. However Coca-Cola has done well in diversifying into other beverages such as water juices and sparkling water.

Meanwhile given the company’s unparalleled scale it has maintained strong cost advantages over its rivals leading to enviable profit margins.

Coca-Cola isn’t going to deliver strong short-term capital gains but its 2.8% dividend yield is rock solid and the company has raised that payout every year in a row dating back to the 1960s.

Emerson Electric (EMR)

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 65

A company with 65 consecutive years of dividend hikes might seem old-fashioned. However companies don’t become Dividend Kings without being able to evolve.

Emerson for example began as an industrial firm focused on making goods such as electric fans sewing machines and power tools. Over the decades Emerson has transformed itself. Nowadays the company is increasingly becoming a software company focusing on the automation of factories and industrial processes.

This is crucial technology right now. Supply chain issues and runaway inflation have made it more vital than ever to get the most out of a company’s existing manufacturing processes.

Emerson’s focus on efficiency and reducing industrial waste for its customers also stands out in the current marketplace which favors environmental social and governance (ESG) friendly investments.

Sometimes an old dog can learn new tricks and Emerson’s transformation into a forward-looking automation company has been one such impressive example.

3M Corp (MMM)

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 64

3M is an American industrial giant. It is most well-known for Post-It notes. However the company makes a vast array of products spanning safety equipment adhesives dental supplies industrial filters and much more.

In short 3M is a diversified conglomerate that in effect is a bet on American industry itself.

MMM stock is also shockingly cheap as it currently sells for just 13 times forward earnings. Traders are worried about the impact of a recession on the company along with some pending lawsuits around product liability.

Once these concerns pass however 3M shares should return to a more generous valuation ratio offering significant capital gains. In the meantime shares offer a compelling 4.1% dividend yield.

Northwest Natural (NWN)

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 66

Northwest Natural is a utility that operates primarily in Oregon and Washington.

Utilities tend to be a very stable business and Northwest Natural has been no exception to that rule. Generally gas utilities earn a regulated return rate and receive upward adjustments for inflation giving investors a reliable stream of cash flows over the decades.

Northwest Natural is not a compelling growth story by any means; it has grown revenues by about 2% per year compounded over the past decade.

However for investors that like a stable income story with a small annual increase NWN stock’s 3.5% starting dividend yield might be just the ticket.

Colgate-Palmolive (CL)

Years of Consecutive Dividend Hikes: 60

Toothpaste and cleaning products maker Colgate-Palmolive has had a forgettable decade.

In 2012 Colgate generated $17.1 billion in revenue. In 2021 this rose to just $17.4 billion which is a less than 1% annualized growth rate. Despite the brief surge in purchases with the pandemic Colgate has struggled to show much top-line growth.

Regardless the company’s dividend growth story rolls on. Due to sizable share buybacks and cost-cutting Colgate has managed to grow underlying earnings and in association its dividend payout despite the lack of revenue growth.

The 2020s may look better than the 2010s. Colgate has a huge presence in emerging markets and thus suffered as many of those countries saw weak economic performance in recent years. Now however with oil metals and agricultural prices through the roof countries such as Brazil should see stronger economic performance and thus lead to a solid upswing in Colgate’s profitability.

On the date of publication Ian Bezek held a long position in NWN EMR DOV and MMM stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.

In the foreword to the book the Bard of Bengal wrote:

“The author did not choose the comfortable method of picking up information from behind lavish bureaucratic hospitality under a revolving electric fan and in an atmosphere of ready-made official opinions…She boldly took in on herself unaided to enter a region of our life all but unexplored by western tourists which had one great advantage in spite of its difficulties that it offered no other path to the writer but that of sharing the life of the people.”

Emerson’s book – which followed the witheringly critical Mother India by Katherine Mayo and Come with Me to India by Patricia Kendall – was seen as empathetic. Like Mayo and Kendall Emerson was American but unlike their accounts hers was the result of a year spent immersed in Pachperwa a village on the border between present-day Uttar Pradesh and Nepal.

Emerson was 36 when she wrote Voiceless India. But by this time she had already established herself as a prolific writer and in the words of Havre Daily News “a globe-trottin’ lady extraordinary”. She had travelled widely in East and Southeast Asia and written acclaimed stories. It seems no assignment daunted her. Once when asked about her travels to lands that many Western women chose to avoid she replied that it had never occurred to her to be afraid.

Her Voiceless India received the same warm reception that her other writing had. One reviewer for The Geographical Journal wrote of Emerson’s “unfriendly references” to British policies in India her “vivid writing” “keen observations” and her “free” and “full” treatment of “vital questions” like caste social custom and religion. Another reviewer said there was not a dull page in the book.

Early travels

Born on May 6 1890 at Lake Forest in Illinois Emerson moved to Ithaca in upstate New York after her father Alfred Emerson became a professor of ancient languages and archaeology at Cornell University. Her mother Alice was a concert pianist. She had three siblings all of whom went on to distinguish themselves in their chosen field.

Emerson travelled with her father to Europe when she was 10 but her peripatetic life began in earnest after she graduated from the University of Chicago majoring in history and literature. In 1914 she took off for Japan where once her grandfather had been consul and learnt the Japanese language and the long-ended bamboo flute the shakuhachi. During her stay she immersed herself in Japanese culture writing about its poetry and gardens the state of education and the role of history in building national pride. A journalistic curiosity informed her writings from Japan that would become the hallmark of much of her work.

A year later Emerson returned to East Asia with her friend Elsie Weil with an express journalistic purpose. At a time when xenophobia against Asian migration was at its height in the US Emerson and Weil became the first American journalists to interview leading figures in Chinese president Yuan Shi Kai’s administration as well as in Japan.

The two had an abiding interest in the region. Emerson became a founding editor of Asia a magazine founded by the philanthropist couple Willard and Dorothy Straight and contributed to it till well into the 1940s while Weil remained its longtime managing editor.

In 1919 Emerson and her brother Alfred an entomologist joined an expedition to Guyana (then British Guiana) in South America. There Emerson explored the lives of the indentured labourers from India who worked in sugar plantations. When the expedition returned it carried back with it a menagerie of animals and insects including butterflies alligators a family of boa constrictors three parrots and a silver tailed hawk. A particularly frisky monkey called Jellico was taken on by Emerson as her personal responsibility.

Around the world

But handling an impish simian was nothing compared to the project she undertook next. In 1920 Emerson set off on a world trip with aviator-photographer Donald Thompson and his wife Dorothy Thompson achieving instant celebrity.

Columnists raved about Emerson’s insatiable thirst for adventure and her delicate build – she was a little over five feet had blue piercing eyes and fine hair. In an article in the New York Tribune writer Katherine Anne Porter said that for a year-long trip to the Orient Emerson carried “five trunks three handbags a hatbox a shoe trunk” as well as gifts such as trinkets colourful pencils strings of wooden beads and bunches of dyed feathers.

Through her trip Emerson wrote widely syndicated dispatches about her adventures: about stunt-flying and exploring underground caves in the Philippines; tiger hunting in Vietnam; and travelling to Angkor Wat in a sampan through dense forests.

A clipping from the Hanford Morning Journal April 20 1922.

Her first visit to India was in 1922 in the midst of the Non-Cooperation Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi. It was a turbulent time and the spirit of the freedom struggle was flaming high. Emerson caught a glimpse of this revolutionary fervour at the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore where Gandhi was addressing a large gathering. Gandhi was a “small almost emaciated figure” she wrote in The New York Times “with bare head and feet wrapped in a nondescript shawl the kind Lincoln used to wear.” But his words were full of purpose. He neither pleaded with the crowded nor flattered it – he insisted that swaraj could not be achieved unless people struggled for it.

Always hungry for adventure she travelled accompanied by a Gurkha bodyguard from Mysore to Malabar where the Mappila Rebellion was raging. Her visit to a village located 20 miles outside Calcutta renewed her acquaintance with the scientist Basiswar ‘Boshi’ Sen. A junior colleague of the physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose Sen had travelled to American universities including Michigan and Cornell where he had met Emerson and Dorothy Straight.

For Emerson that brief experience of village life was an eye-opener. She saw first-hand the impact of malaria on people’s lives the daily drudgery of women and the oppression inflicted on tenant farmers by zamindars and moneylenders.

Even after she returned to the US India never left her. In 1925 along with other women explorers – Blair Niles Marguerite Harrison Gertrude Mathews Shelby – Emerson founded the Society of Women Geographers that still lives on. She was also a fellow of the Royal Geographic Society.

A clipping from The Kansas City Star July 5 1922.

Life in India

In 1926 she made her second visit to India via Europe and West Asia entering the subcontinent through Khyber Pass. Pushing on atop a young elephant she reached Pachperwa a village in Balrampur on the Nepal-Uttar Pradesh border. By this time she knew a bit of Hindustani and came equipped with a medicine chest that made her popular among the villagers.

Emerson was aware despite her straitened lifestyle in the village of her privilege. Her simple house with its adobe walls was built quickly with villagers providing the necessary labour. Adorning the walls were colourful patterns made of herbal dyes produced by the women in Pachperwa.

Voiceless India based on her days in Pachperwa was published in 1930. In the book Emerson stressed that most Indian women lived sheltered lives and were far less educated than men – and yet they needed to be judged in their own context not in contrast to women in the West. Change was inevitable she said but it would be slow.

In November 1932 she married Boshi Sen in Calcutta. And three years later they moved to Almora in North India along with the Vivekananda laboratory that Sen had founded to experiment on plant cells and agricultural produce. Kundan House where the Sens set up their lives looked out on the eastern Himalayas and afforded a welcome refuge for the family’s friends: the painter Earl Brewster Lama Anagarika Govinda and members of the Nehru family.

Emerson wrote her second book A Pageant of Indian Civilization in 1948. Illustrated by her sister Edith it followed the flawed periodisation of Indian history established by James Mill and yet evoked the artistic and literary achievements of the ruling dynasties. For this book she was adjudged a co-winner of the Watumull Prize. In 1965 she wrote Cultural Unity of India tracing the cultural traditions that gave India an essential unity.

The couple as Girish Mehra notes in Nearer Heaven than Earth (2007) helped the celebrated dancer Uday Shankar set up his dance academy in Shimtola Almora. But despite the talented artistes on its roster the Uday Shankar India Culture Centre unfortunately did not last long.

Sen who was greatly affected by the 1943 famine was a pioneering figure in India’s Green Revolution spearheading research in hybrid varieties of maize and onion. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1957 and the Watumull Prize for his contributions to agriculture in 1961. He died a decade later. Emerson survived him for 11 years. She lived on in Almora and was anguished at Cold War rivalries and the way foreign interference undermined local lives and customs. During these years she organised a series of local endeavours to debate issues that mattered. The Vivekananda Laboratory a cause dear to both Sen and Emerson is today part of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and called the Vivekananda Parvatiya Krishi Anusandhan.

In 1936 journalist Lowell Thomas wrote an article about Emerson headlined ‘90 pounds of courage’. Detailing her life and travels Thomas concluded that she stood out because of a “combination of unusual qualities”: “An able executive a gifted writer a magnetic public speaker a scholar a dauntless traveller and explorer a penetrating intelligence at work upon our problems of tomorrow an interpreter of the East to us who badly need such interpreters – she is a woman whom we should not wait for our children to be proud of.”

Seven months before Minneapolis became known as the city where George Floyd was flagrantly murdered by police the Atlantic magazine published an article commending the Minneapolis City Council for becoming a pioneer in the country by doing “something long considered impossible in American politics: end[ing] single-family zoning in an entire city.”

This “could mark a major turning point nationwide” the author wrote because the loudest not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) voices tend to come from wealthy homeowners who often go to public meetings to thwart the construction of new housing.

A National Apartment Association survey in 2019 found that the primary reason affordable housing developments are shot down is because of resistance from neighbors. Delays to proposed projects can be costly which makes affordable housing less affordable.

The article notes: “Social scientists broadly agree that bans on multifamily housing are bad for housing affordability bad for racial equality and bad for the environment.”

Housing remains a crisis city- state- and nationwide. Headway is being made but the gap remains wide because of decades of underinvestment and a history of racialized convenants that prevented marginalized communities from living in white neighborhoods.

Before the city measure passed multi-family homes were banned in 70 percent of the residential land in Minneapolis. Similar zoning laws restrict neighborhoods in other cities. The Minneapolis 2040 plan will enable housing units in the city to potentially triple.

The Atlantic author wrote that the changed policy in Minneapolis is “so unusual that my colleagues at the Century Foundation and I undertook a detailed review of how and why reformers prevailed.”

One reason reform happened was that proponents of multi-family housing focused public discussion on who the victims of exclusionary zoning are and how numerous they are. Another reason was that younger city council leaders elected in 2017 recognized that housing was unaffordable for young people policy was rooted in racist origins and lack of affordability meant people were moving further away and increasing commuter gas emissions.

Opposition focused on narratives that were not true the article indicated: “Red signs bearing the slogan ‘don’t bulldoze our neighborhood’ proliferated — even though no one was proposing to bulldoze anything.” A similar outcry a few years earlier opposed in-law apartments to be created alongside single-family homes which some opponents indicated would become “houses of prostitution.”

In contrast some yes-in-my-backyard (YIMBY) movements were led with the slogan of “neighbors for more neighbors” especially promoting density with car-less mobility.

Atlantic author Richard Kahlenberg concluded with these words: “It is humiliating for local governments to tell people of modest means that they are not welcome in a certain community and that their children do not belong in its public schools. … If the victims of single-family zoning speak up as they did in Minneapolis they may begin to bury an anachronistic practice that has done so much harm for so many years.”

Self Interests vs. Community Needs

Debra Stein who specialized in changing mindsets around controversial land-use projects around the country before she died in 2009 indicated that she started her public affairs career after a woman spit on her at a public hearing. “As I was wiping saliva off my arm I said to myself ‘I am going to figure out why this happened and never let it happen again.’”

She offered this explanation in an Affordable Housing Finance interview: “Years of traditional religious training have taught many Americans that we must help those in need. But the Protestant work ethic is also a strong moral tradition in America emphasizing that individuals must pull themselves by their bootstraps to attain the material rewards of hard work. When wealth is seen as evidence of moral worth residents fear that people who are less wealthy will be less desirable neighbors and more likely to engage in antisocial behavior compared to higher-income neighbors.”

She added “As American ethics about individualism and social responsibility evolve it has become increasingly acceptable to put self interests above broader community needs. The Me Generation is simply not willing to tolerate minor impacts for the sake of the larger community and feels less guilty about protecting its own self-interest even at the expense of other people.”

Her research and books about the NIMBY mindset in America led her to advise people not to spend too much time and resources trying to placate anti-housing opponents but to mobilize pro-housing supporters.

In one recent local example the retiring Sisters of Notre Dame in southern Minnesota wanted to repurpose their extensive property at Tourtellotte Park in Mankato into an affordable housing community. With objections from neighbors who feared property values would go down — while crime rates noise and traffic would go up — that project was canceled.

Supportive housing for marginalized communities — extending beyond those in need of affordable housing to include those supported by in-house services and programs — has another layer of NIMBYism.

In 2014 Golden Valley’s city council rejected a day mental health facility for children after residents complained it would lead to security issues. In 2018 Forest Lake residents rejected a $20 million psychiatric residential treatment facility for children. One concern raised was that it could open a Pandora’s Box of development including sex offender treatment.

According to Sue Abderholden director of National Alliance on Mental Illness Minnesota many mental illnesses are identifiable between the ages of 14 and 24 but go untreated because of the lack of options for families. In the end the criminal system often takes over instead of having a health care response to mitigate mental illness.

Abderholden said in a Changemakers Alliance conversation: “The Golden Valley [rejection] was probably the worst of my experiences. They did not want ‘those’ kids near ‘their’ kids. A lot of it is just fear about people with mental illnesses or other types of disabilities.”

Not providing community supports does not make issues go away of course. It just leaves them untreated.

A Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics report titled “The Cost of Mental Illness: Minnesota Facts and Figures” based largely on 2017 data estimated there are half a million Minnesotans living with mental illness which can lead to a fivefold increase in substance use disorders. Many of the unmet needs of this population are attributable to the high cost of treatment.

The overall annual cost of incarcerating people with serious mental illness in state prisons in Minnesota exceeds $230 million.

In one public discussion the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections indicated it costs less to treat mental illness than it does to imprison someone and estimated there is a $6 payback for every dollar invested in prevention treatment housing and employment training — which reduces crime.

Georgia Jane Lyon now working at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington D.C. wrote a thesis in 2019 for her degree at Whitman College about NIMBY/YIMBY movements. She wrote about a Minneapolis neighborhood effort in the 1970s to preserve its community when developers were threatening to dismantle it. As quoted in “Defending Community: The Struggle for Alternative Redevelopment in Cedar-Riverside” “When community members complained private developers told them ‘this land is too valuable to have you people living on it.’”

Breanne Rothstein economic and housing director for Brooklyn Park wrote a womenspress.com commentary indicating: “People have historically come up with unrealistic (at best) and racist (at worst) reasons to oppose the construction of new housing units. Instead of opposing projects and zoning changes in your neighborhood be vocally supportive of all housing and especially affordable rental housing in your community.”

In reality the Cambria Hills center opened in East Bethel in 2020 but closed in 2021 due to license violations and financial issues.

The old convent on Adam Street which was a girls' school before becoming a retirement home for nuns is now being transformed into an affordable housing project.

The heritage building will become a lifeline for low-income Montrealers.

""This isn't a project that will be met with 'not in my backyard' attitudes"" said Jean-Pierre Racette SHAPEM's general director. ""We'll be housing people with low incomes the elderly have a daycare it's really mixed""

SHAPEM is a non-profit organization dedicated to creating and managing inclusive and sustainable community housing. With the help of the FTQ Solidarity Fund SHAPEM dished out about $2.5 million in December 2019 to buy the building from the nuns who didn't want to sell to private developers.

The plan is to gut the convent turn it into about 80 units of affordable housing and turn the large yard into a park for the community and a daycare.

""I just feel good when I'm in here"" Racette said while giving a tour of the convent's multi-coloured rooms.

SHAPEM is one of almost a dozen major organizations in Montreal working to keep housing affordable by either purchasing or building housing units and keeping them off the speculative market.

But with construction costs skyrocketing and a need for more funding that might not happen for another few years — and that is a problem shared by many groups with similar goals.

These organizations all have different missions and funding models and they serve different communities. But at their core they all fight gentrification by protecting housing units from private developers and keeping them affordable in the long term.

CBC News spoke with seven of these organizations — SHAPEM SOLIDES UTILE Interloge Bâtir son quartier Accueil Bonneau and Brique par brique — which together have either bought or built around 23800 housing units over the last three decades with about 6200 more on the way.

In Montreal there are about 24000 people on a waiting list for social or affordable housing.

François Giguère was working at a housing committee in Châteauguay pushing for social housing to be built in the early 2000s. When that demand wasn't met the commitee started looking at an alternative: socializing existing buildings.

That's how SOLIDES was formed and today the organization owns more than 600 housing units. Giguère said they have another 600 families on their waiting list in Châteauguay Verdun Lachine and Longueuil.

Their most recent acquisition is a building with six apartments and a restaurant on Bannantyne St. and 6e Avenue in Verdun purchased in early May.

""What we do is we find the funding to purchase existing buildings with the intent of providing housing for the tenants who are there at the moment help them stay in their apartment building their neighbourhood if that's what they choose"" said Giguère.

They do this through regular maintenance renovations and controlled rent increases that never exceed two per cent per year.

What are my rights as a renter in Quebec? Duration 7:47 We cut through the legalese to bring you answers to questions you may not even know you should be asking. Can my landlord kick me out for renovations? Does my landlord have to show me the previous tenant’s rent? Are rent decreases possible? While Quebec has rules for protecting renters tenants have to be pretty savvy to wade through misinformation bureaucracy and language barriers when learning about the law.

Though SOLIDES has used government funding in the past many of the programs designed to help build affordable housing – like AccèsLogis – have run dry. They mostly leverage the equity on the buildings they already own to make acquisitions. Other groups however still rely on various programs from all three levels of government.

""François Legault wants to help people making more than $60000 a year and doesn't really care about people making minimum wage welfare recipients or workers. It's very obvious in their policy they did as little as possible in the housing sector and they just looked at so many ways to deny the housing crisis"" said Giguère.

""It's just unbelievable.""

Having a few thousand units taken off the speculative market plays a critical part in easing the housing crisis but it doesn't absolve the government of responsibility said spokesperson for housing group FRAPRU Véronique Laflamme.

Sectors being left behind

In Parc-Extension gentrification has been on the rise since the arrival of the new Université de Montréal MIL campus in 2017. The neighbourhood known to many as Park Ex has seen a rise in renovictions and abusive rent hikes pushing people out of their homes.

Yet few units of affordable or social housing are present. In 2020 the city of Montreal purchased a building across from Parc Metro known as the Johnny Brown building or Plaza Hutchison. But two years later it's still gutted and locked shut.

The neighbourhood housing committee the Comité d'action de Parc-Extension (CAPE) and the co-operative Monde Uni have been pushing for the city to purchase a building on Jarry Street. after a co-operative project for it was blocked.

""I think it's absolutely necessary at this point to be looking at other possibilities of creating social and community housing"" said CAPE spokesperson Amy Darwish.

""In Park Extension there's been a number of sites that have been acquired through the right of first refusal over the past few years. But if there isn't any funding it's going to be very very difficult to get them developed.""

Brique par brique a non-profit organization committed to community housing and diversity in Park Ex recently acquired an old paint factory which will be turned into 31 units of affordable housing.

But there is still a lot of work to do before anyone can move in and there are 1000 people waiting for apartments in the area.

""The city is too little too late and the province is not doing anything"" said Alessandra Renzi a professor of communications at Concordia who co-authored a report on the impact of artificial intelligence in Parc-Extension.

But grassroots organizations can work independently and are aware of their communities' needs putting them in a good position to get projects off the ground she said.

Their main challenge is a lack of funding and government support.

Non-profits can't fill in for government

Because many of these groups are purchasing existing buildings they are competing with private developers for the same properties. Many sellers are seeking prices above market value making it difficult for non-profit organizations. The cost of construction has also skyrocketed in recent years.

FRAPRU's Laflamme said it would be ideal if a government program could be put in place to fund organizations purchasing or building affordable housing.

Housing groups like FRAPRU and CAPE have criticized the Coalition Avenir Quebec government's latest housing program which is dedicated to providing subsidies to private developers to add affordable units to their housing projects.

They say the private and non-profit sectors should not be competing for public funding and stress that the government must keep the AccèsLogis program going.

Avi Friedman a professor of architecture at McGill University who has researched social housing conditions said government programs provide an avenue for accountability as to how funds are managed.

Anyone getting funding from the government whether it be non-profit organizations or private developers will have to report how they put the funding to use.

This week the municipal affairs minister tabled Bill 37 which would give municipalities the right of first refusal any time a lot or building is put up for sale. The bill would also reduce the number of years the owner of a new building can have free rein to increase rents (section F of a lease) from five to three.

Non-profits that use public funds to purchase buildings would also need the minister's permission before selling them. Under the proposed law the social and community character of these buildings must be preserved.

Because Quebec's current housing supply is so low ""anything that promotes affordable housing is good"" Friedman said.

That said he doesn't believe the private sector can address the housing supply problems.

Community groups ""will be extremely important because they respond to market niches that developers are not interested in"" such as those with low incomes single parents the elderly and those with disabilities said Friedman.

Housing committees have been calling for 50000 units of diverse types of social and affordable housing over the last few years. This includes co-operatives but also public housing known as HLMs and housing for people experiencing homelessness or those with health issues.

""We've always said it takes more public housing or HLMs. Those respond to important needs"" said Laflamme. According to her non-profits and co-ops cannot replace public housing.

Since 2018 the CAQ government has built more than 8000 social and affordable housing units and more than $1.8 billion have been invested according to Bénédicte Trottier-Lavoir a spokesperson for Housing Minister Andrée Laforest.

Some construction will be able to start up as soon as this summer through the new Quebec Affordable Housing Program she said.

But Laflamme is thankful that groups like SOLIDES exist because the government ""hasn't stepped up"" and without them ""there are sectors where nothing would happen at all.""

""We need to have ways of doing this work on a larger scale"" she said.

""It's the only way to avoid losing more housing units bought by large companies looking for profit. [...]Those housing units we lose will not come back.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvb2Zmc2hvcmUtZmlybXMtb3duLWNoaWxkcmVuLWhvbWVzLXVrLTh4cGdxdGIzNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Offshore firms own children's homes,"Half of Britain’s biggest children’s social care operators are owned by offshore private equity firms The Times has found.

The taxation approach is designed to tackle the county’s housing crisis but critics say it is having unintended consequences pushing up property prices draining money from the local economy and changing visitor demographics for the worse.

Some second homes on the market have been in family ownership for generations others are been sold by families with Welsh-speaking children. One “devastated” owner a regular visitor to Llŷn Peninsula for 70 years sold her second home in Abersoch last December after becoming saddled with rising costs and disillusioned by growing numbers of rowdy holidaymakers with no roots in the community.

A Pwllheli businesswoman who looks after second homes when their owners are away said a double tragedy was now unfolding in holiday hotspots where local people have been priced out of the housing market. “Too many of my clients are now selling their second homes as they simply cannot justify the extortionate taxes” said the woman who asked not to be named.

“These homes aren’t going to locals but to buyers prepared to pay over the odds. These people are either looking to open holiday lets just as the staycation boom ends or they are wealthy individuals who will use their second houses less often leading to the closure of independent shops bars and restaurants.”

In April 2021 owners of second and empty homes in Gwynedd began paying a 100% premium on their council charges. From April 1 2023 this could potentially rise to 300% quadrupling council tax bills for affected owners.

The measure is discretionary and it will be up to individual councils to judge how punitive the increases will be. The Welsh Government sanctioned the approach last year amid widespread concerns over the housing crisis engulfing many Welsh-speaking communities.

Costly to stay painful to leave sad to see so many Airbnbs

For Sue Hanning a retired primary school teacher from the West Midlands she could no longer justify monthly payments of £440 for the two-bedroom property she and her first husband bought in 1993. She sold up in December so cutting ties with a village that went back seven decades: Sue 70 has been visiting Abersoch since she was a child her grandfather becoming good friends with the then harbourmaster and often staying in his house.

After divorcing she was left with the Abersoch property her ex-husband the matrimonial home. Over the years it became a place of sanctuary for herself and her immediate family. The house was only ever rented out to close friends.

Initially Sue was charged half-rate council tax. When it rose to the full rate she was happy to pay – even though the property was originally built as a summer holiday home and lacks central heating.

A few years ago Gwynedd Council began charging a 50% premium and last year this increased to 100% doubling her council tax. By next April she could be paying an eyewatering £900-a-month.

“I may as well climb to the top of a mountain and throw away my pension” she said. “I want to leave my daughter something and be prepared for care home fees. It left me in profit but the property was never an investment – I even dropped the price so the buyers could afford their mortgage.”

(Image: Ian Cooper/North Wales Live)

Sue’s house on the Cae Du estate was in one of two blocks of six adjacent properties once all second homes. One by one they began to disappear: only two of the 12 now remain. They were replaced by holiday lets bought and refurbished by investors who according to Sue needed to sweat their assets to recover their outlays.

The result was a rapid churn of holidaymakers with little empathy for the village she said. On one occasion recalled Sue a group arrived on the beach demanding to know where the pier was. It was farcical – but other incidents made her blood boil.

“One night the people opposite were rowdy and kept me awake until 4.30am” she said. “They did not care about the area and they didn’t care how much noise they made.

“Once it was idyllic but it’s all changing now. All the locals say it’s so sad that second homes are being replaced by Airbnbs.”

COMMENT: Tourism vs local homes - is it one or the other? Have your say in the comments below.

Some changes were small but still annoying. Where once they were left empty over winter residents’ bins are now filled by casual visitors. Meanwhile bin collections have been switched from Saturdays to Wednesdays - Saturday collections were handier for second home owners on weekend visits.

Sue who remarried and now lives in Staffordshire twice upgraded her Abersoch kitchen and bathroom insisting on local labour each time. Others don’t. “They hand the keys to a man in Manchester and tell them to get on with it” she said. Her former holiday home is now an Airbnb.

Selling her beloved property was “painful”. She loved the village and its community – and still does. “It’s hard whenever I see a Facebook post on Abersoch” she said. “I decided it would be just too difficult for me to go back there this year.

“I was devastated when I realised I couldn’t afford to keep my home. I am not some rich millionaire. I am a retired primary school teacher who remortgaged my main home to buy my dream. My home in Abersoch was my sanctuary and safe place with memories of my holidays with my parents grandfather and sister.”

Owners fleeing the area

Sue’s experiences chime with those of other home owners in the village. One couple who raised their children as Welsh speakers in the village have put their family home and holiday property on the market. Despite living in Abersoch for decades they have been spooked by the Welsh Government’s changes to holiday let occupancy rules designed to crack down on second homes.

From April 1 2023 properties must be rented at least 182 days each year. If they fail to reach this threshold their owners will pay council tax rather than business rates – potentially with a 300% premium.

“They decided they couldn’t take the risk” said the Pwllheli property manager. “If they miss the occupancy target by a single day they could lose a significant chunk of their annual revenue. They have no option but to sell up and return to England.”

Another of her clients is selling up and a third will make a decision this weekend. The latter lives locally and the family's two holiday lets have been handed down through the generations. But Cardiff’s approach to tourism has set the alarm bells ringing.

“They can’t face the hassle of trying to rent the properties out for so many nights just to meet the proposed council tax thresholds” she said. Yet they face a dilemma: having invested heavily in upgrading their holiday lets they are in negative equity until they recoup their outlay.

Another local agent reported three second home sales so far this year. Unlike Sue all could afford the extra council taxes. But the agent said they chose to move away because they felt “bullied” by the county’s “anti-tourism” policies.

'Charity shops on the high street'

It’s estimated that a tenth of Gwynedd’s housing stock now comprises second homes and holiday lets. In some areas the figure is over 50% – and rising. But while there is a clear need to tackle the problem questions are being asked about the approaches being taken.

Critics believe that targeting second homes through council taxes rises is driving up the number of unregulated holiday lets. It's also creating a new price spiral: by forcing owners to sell up the policy is displacing long-established visitors with a new generation of well-heeled buyers able to afford properties that remain beyond the reach of local people.

These buyers said the unnamed property manager are more likely to “spend time on their yachts” than support local businesses. Fewer are families she believes. “These people are not going to be popping to the newsagents or buying a bucket and spade for the beach” she said. “The first to complain will be the locals when they see yet more charity shops on the high street.”

Alternative solutions are needed visitors believe. One might be through the planning system ring-fencing affordable new homes for local people with appropriate sell-on clauses much like Section 106 agricultural ties. Yet there is a perception that Gwynedd Council has done too little to reinvest its council tax proceeds in local housing stocks.

On Facebook one person said: “New houses need to be built by the council only to be sold to Welsh people. In all the years I’ve been coming to Llanbedrog only eight houses (I think) have been built.”

Another idea is to make greater use of the stock of empty and semi-derelict cottages. Empty homes already incur a council tax surcharge but too few are brought back into use because of a lack of local facilities said the property manager.

“My mother lives in Snowdonia in an area with little infrastructure” she said. ""There’s no mobile phone or satellite coverage and BT is axing its analogue phone lines.

“If the council was to invest in infrastructure and ease planning restrictions it could bring multiple empty properties back into use – lots of local young people would jump at the chance. By doing this it could actually revive many communities rather than biting the hand that feeds so many of us on the Llŷn.”

What a Gwynedd Council spokesperson said about the issue “Recent research shows that 60% of Gwynedd residents are priced out of the housing market that the county has the highest percentage of second homes in Wales and amongst the highest number of long-term empty properties.

As a Council we are committed to tackling this unacceptable situation. That is why we introduced a 50% Council Tax premium on second homes and long-term empty properties in April 2018 and subsequently raised this premium to 100% in April 2021. Any further change in the rate of Council Tax premium would be a matter for consideration for the full Council to decide upon.

Our Council Tax premium policy is helping to deliver a range of projects in our £77 million Housing Action Plan. This plan includes various schemes to tackle the lack of affordable housing available for local people as well as the historic and current issues relating to high levels of empty properties and second homes.

As part of this work the Council's Cabinet has earmarked £5.4 million to purchase and renovate properties over the coming years so that they can be made available for local people to rent. We have recently contacted over a thousand empty property owners in Gwynedd to ascertain their future plans with a view to purchasing them if possible.

Alongside this we are providing financial support to first time buyers to renovate their properties making the most of the Welsh Government’s ‘Houses into Homes’ scheme which offers support to convert or renovate redundant buildings into homes and numerous other schemes such as Homebuy.”

In 1986 American businessman Richard Bass landed in the record books by becoming the first person to climb the “seven summits” the highest peaks from each continent. On that list are some of the most iconic mountains in the world: Denali in Alaska Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and of course Mount Everest.

But mountain climbers aren’t the kind of people who just let records rest. For many mountaineers it’s the seven second summits – aka the second highest peak on each continent – that are considered a more significant feat.

These mountains are less famous less popular with novice climbers and less commercialized. The most famous of the group is K2 located on the border of Pakistan and China in the Karakoram Range.

The rest though are anything but household names.

Ojos de Salado (“Salty Eyes”) on the Chile-Argentina border is the highest volcano on the planet. Mount Tyree in Antarctica is relatively easy to climb by mountaineering standards but the challenges of getting to the White Continent and coping with its weather conditions mean that only about a dozen climbers have ever made it to the top.

Only one person has officially climbed all seven of the second summits but there’s someone hot on his heels to complete the set. And she isn’t what most people think a mountaineer looks like – she’s a mom of seven who lives in Utah and didn’t start climbing until she was in her thirties.

Throwing down the challenge

Meet Jenn Drummond. Drummond has always been athletic and she loves a challenge.

With her 40th birthday on the horizon in 2020 she decided to take her hiking skills to the next level.

That year she hired a climbing coach with the goal of summiting Ama Dablam a mountain in Nepal.

But after completing it the coach presented a new challenge – the Seven Second Summits. “He said ‘you have seven children there are seven continents” she recalls.

But climbing mountains requires a lot more than physical training. Covid threw the whole world into disarray – suddenly Drummond had to home school her kids and international border closures made it impossible to travel.

Once Chile reopened to tourists in fall 2021 Drummond headed there to climb Ojos de Salado her first of the seven peaks.

So far she has climbed Dykh-Tau Mount Kenya Mount Tyree and most recently Mount Logan in Canada. K2 is planned for summer 2022.

Drummond’s quest to climb the seven second summits has turned into a slightly longer project due to some disagreement about which peaks count as the official seven.

If you only consider the continent to be the country of Australia itself the second summit there is Mount Townsend in the state of New South Wales.

But for geographers who consider Australasia and Oceania part of the continent the second summit is Sumantri in Indonesia’s West Papua province. To make sure her record is indisputable Drummond plans to climb both.

Because it’s there

In an anecdotal story someone once asked the explorer George Mallory why he was so desperate to summit Mount Everest the mountain that eventually claimed his life.

“Because it’s there” he responded.

Although it’s not clear whether Mallory actually uttered those words they have long been a touchstone for other climbers who struggle to explain why they risk life and limb to summit the world’s most challenging mountains.

Drummond agrees. She likes to climb mountains for the sake of the act. But she also knows that records mean something.

“if I had a Guinness World Record my kids would actually think I’m cool” she laughs.

She also wants to address some of the inequalities that exist in the small rarefied world of mountaineering. For years the image of a mountain climber was someone like Reinhold Messner or Edmund Hillary – bearded serious ice-ax-toting white men from Europe or North America.

Organizations like Full Circle an all-Black group of mountaineers who summited Everest in May 2022 are showing the world that extreme activities like mountain climbing are available to anyone with the grit to try.

Mountain climbing can be exceptionally dangerous. People can die from altitude sickness falls and the cold. But it’s not only the mountains themselves that provide challenges.

At the base of Sumantri two rival tribes are at war over who has the rights to the mine there. And the ongoing conflict in Russia has resulted in many airlines stopping flights to the country which means that Dykh-Tau is challenging to reach.

It is also expensive and time-consuming.

Simply getting a permit to hike Everest costs $11000. That doesn’t include airfare local transportation gear and guide fees.

Plus it can take weeks or even months to scale some of the world’s highest peaks due to the acclimation process.

For Drummond being a woman on a mountain is an asset not a weakness.

“There’s definitely people who approach the mountains as me versus the mountain” she says.

“For me it is so much more an experience of being with the mountain. If you go into Everest and you’re in the Himalaya mountain range that mountain range in my opinion is very feminine. It’s very loving. It’s enormous. It’s beautiful. The people are unbelievable. They honor life. They pray before they climb the mountain.”

Her climbs have also become a way to connect with her children who range in age from 9 to 15. Some have joined her on climbs while others prefer to hang out on lower ground.

But they’ve all been watching their mother pursue her goal. Drummond has used her mission as a way to motivate the kids in their own lives.

“We’ll look at Mount Everest” she tells them during a homework session “but first you’re going to do your math.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial efforts by firefighters were hampered by live wires that were down in front of the building officials said. Eversource was called to the scene to shut down power in the area.

Water was placed on adjacent structures to prevent the fire from spreading and crews were able to confine the flames to just one building however it was severely damaged.

No other injuries were reported. The residents of the house were not home at the time of the fire officials said. A rabbit was rescued from the home and taken to Manchester Animal Hospital.

It appeared no one was in the River Road home when it went up in flames firefighters said.

Powerlines went down in the front yard and crews needed to wait for Eversource to cut the power before they could really get to work. In the meantime water was placed on neighboring homes to prevent the fire from spreading.

Pittsfield Public Schools Hold First Unified Game Day



The day included sports competitions by age group. See more photos here. PITTSFIELD Mass. — The School Department held its first Unified Game Day on Friday that included the district's special needs children and families in a daylong Special Olympics event at Taconic High School.

""We want to showcase the strengths that students have and there are so many. I think that a lot of their strengths come out during this event. They persevere through a lot to be able to just come to school to be able to participate in everything to be able to make the gap lesser and lesser and for everyone to be accepted and to feel accepted"" educator and co-organizer Bridget McKeever said.

""And I think that's one of the most important things is everybody has a right to come to school and feel excited and feel like they want to learn and feel comfortable and safe.""

Stearns Elementary pupils participated in the event along with special education students from Crosby and Egremont Elementary Reid Middle and Pittsfield High schools.

The career and technical education students built the risers for the children to receive their medals on after each game.

The field was separated in half by age with each side having a running race long jump and softball throw.

McKeever and co-organizer Katie Lefkowitz were inspired to create a game day after attending Special Olympics over the years. Leftokowitz is a speech pathologist and McKeever a special education teacher at Stearns.

Hundreds of students gathered around in a circle in the field's center as each group marched with the posters they made signifying their schools.

They surprised their parents with a choreographed dance to ""This Is Me Song"" by Keala Settle and ""The Greatest Showman Ensemble"" led by McKeever and Lefkowitz.

""I looked at the dance just to see everyone and you know what like it's so exciting just that we could have this many people in one arena during COVID times"" McKeever said. ""Everyone getting along everyone being nice. Everyone forming a nice community and bond and people having fun. Kids feeling successful.""

The students could be seen laughing and competing while enjoying the cloudy spring day.

The Fire Department brought Sparky the robotic firehouse dog and handed out firefighter caps. The police handed out popsicles from Operation Copsicle.

The two women had worked for three years with Superintendent Joseph Curtis Assistant Superintendent Marisa Mendonsa and Stearns Principal Sara Luciani and head custodian Daniel Moore to make the day happen.

They wanted to create an opportunity to collaborate with other schools while also giving parents a chance to interact with the staff meet their children's current and future educators and see their children succeed.

""Our focus really is to have a wonderful community event where parents can come and see their children succeed"" McKeever said.

""We talked about schools and community collaboration but we don't really do it. And we haven't been able to do it because of COVID. So now that the restrictions are a little bit lighter we completely took advantage of that this year.""

The Special Olympics Committee awarded them a grant to cover the expenses.

The games gave families a chance to cheer students and praise their success. It is a reflection of the direction that schools in the area are going in.

Lefkowitz said the community and parents don't see that work that's being done every day in the classroom.

""They don't get to see the relationships that our children are building with each other whether or not they have special needs and they really are each other's cheerleaders"" she said. ""Because at the end of the day none of us are perfect.

""So we all need somebody to cheer us on whether it's reading writing running driving or just showing up for work. I mean we all need that person. And I think the unified games is just an extension of what's currently happening in our schools.""

The Pittsfield Public Schools are becoming a more unified place by providing more opportunities to students who have disabilities.

""Bridget and I both have children and we know how happy excited we are when they excel at anything but there's something about sports that just has kind of a natural excitement to them. And so many of our students that have special needs don't always get the same opportunities for sports"" Lefkowitz said.

They are hoping that as time goes on this event grows so they can include more people. They will be sending out feedback forms so that they can learn more and improve the event next year.",,,,,,

During peak times the amount of delivery increases considerably so my household income increases as well. I’ve now been able to start investing in my own business. My daughter’s ambition is to become an IAS officer and I will do my best to realise her dreams. Amreek Singh small storeowner & IHS partner Amritsar Punjab

Our partners in success

At the heart of Amazon’s successful delivery strategy lies its last-mile connectivity program — IHS. What began with 2500 neighborhood stores now has over 20000 stores. Its programme partners are local entrepreneurs — general store owners kiosk owners mobile accessories repair and recharge shopkeepers grocery store owners vegetable vendors etc. — who are not only familiar with their neighbourhoods but also enjoy the goodwill of their communities.

Today she helps deliver about 35-50 packages every day as an Amazon IHS partner earning an extra INR 15000-20000 per month.

Through the lens of courage and confidence

With a seven-member family to look after and being differently-abled led Ketan M Rodriguez the owner of Baba General Stores of Vikhroli Mumbai to believe he had to stay cooped up in his shop until sales shoot up. But after several lean periods and not many profits to fall back on Ketan wondered if there were any other options that could be explored as opposed to the current roadblock he was experiencing.

The partnership with Amazon at around the same time was a shot in the arm for Ketan who felt more bounded by his limitations than by anything else. He was introduced to the 'I Have Space' program of Amazon by his friend as the possibility of a partnership with Amazon. What ensued was a success story filled with opportunity determination and new-found hope.

Armed with a three-wheeled scooter and a physical store already in place Ketan said 'why not?' to a partnership that allowed him to select a delivery and pick-up point and also deliver Amazon shipments to homes in the vicinity. For a person who felt that it was impossible to step out of his house the courage this partnership gave him was boundless.

Not only has the audience expanded online but the people he met by virtue of deliveries have also located Baba General Stores and have begun to drop in for supplies of late.

Ketan wants his story to inspire more differently abled individuals. Today ambition rings clear and loud in his voice as he speaks about Amazon not as a work partner but as a beacon of hope in his life.

I Have Space - The story of Arun

Take the case of Arun a mobile recharge and repair shop owner in Amritsar Punjab. His business wasn’t flourishing and life was quite hard for him—he was barely able to meet daily expense of his family. But once he started working with Amazon his life changed completely.

When I started this work I did not have to make any investment. There was no fee. So I thought it would be a part-time work and would provide some additional income. But soon it turned into my primary source of income. Now I am able to fulfil every need of my family Arun

Ease of delivery and pick up

The programme does not require any investments from the local partners while ensuring consumer traffic to their own stores — translating into a win–win strategy for all. The IHS program requires local storeowners to deliver products to customers within a 2–4 km radius of their stores. In addition their stores also double up as pick-up points for customers residing in the neighbourhood. On an average Amazon’s IHS store partners deliver between 20–30 packages a day while earning a fixed amount per delivery in return.

Compared to how things were earlier it’s been much easier to run the house since we started working with Amazon. Barsha Das grocery store owner & IHS partner Jorhat Assam

Growing footprint

The innovative delivery program was launched in 2015 and today boasts of IHS partners in over 180 cities in India. Most IHS centers are located in tier-II and III towns such as Amritsar Jodhpur Ajmer Kota Bharuch Nasik Kolhapur Belgaum Tirupur Warrangal Guntur Raipur Agra Kohlapur and Dehradun in addition to India’s leading metro cities.

Partnering with Amazon has been one of the best decisions of our lives. We are very proud to have created our own identity. We are now recognized as Amazon Partners’ and that has also helped us attract more footfall to our vegetable shop. Ganesh Rao and Chinna Rao vegetable vendors & IHS partners Visakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh

I Have Space a story from Jorhat

'My family is happy with the extra earnings'

A grocery owner in Jorhat Assam - Nagen Chandra Das- says that his life turned around after partnering with Amazon. ""I was told to that I can deliver parcels to a 3-4 Kms radius whenever I had free time. This flexibility is good as I can run the shop and do this too. Everyone in my family is happy because we are now earning more thanks to the number of parcels increasing. Also customers have begun recognizing me and that helps our store's business too.:

'IHS has given me additional income'

For the differently abled Manoj Gatty who owns a general store at Katipala in Karnataka empowerment came in many different ways when he partnered with us. From a small-time retailer who barely earned enough to make ends meet today he earns an additional income through his affiliation with IHS. His store has begun to grow in popularity in the locality and what's more he has also hired a delivery hand. In his own words ""Amazon has given me and my family a new lease of life.""

'It helped brighten a student’s future'

After partnering with us for the 'I Have Space' (IHS) program Neha Raj who owns a small kiosk of cosmetic goods in Patna saw her monthly income more than double. Barely a few months into the program moreover she could even employ a young student who paid his college tuition fees through his earnings as her delivery boy. ""There is no greater joy than to be able to support my family and brighten somebody else's future as well"" shares Neha. Today she helps deliver about 35-50 packages every day as an Amazon IHS partner earning an extra Rs.18000-20000 per month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vaG93LXRvL2hvdy10by11c2UteW91ci1pY2xvdWQtcGhvdG9zLW9uLWlwaG9uZS1hbmQtaXBhZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to use your iCloud Photos on iPhone and iPad,"Just how many photos are stored on your iPhone? How much storage are those photos (and videos) taking up? Although Apple has slowly raised the storage limits on its top-selling product in recent years there's still no way to add storage to an existing device. Because of this you might want to consider using iCloud for all your photo and video needs. With iCloud Photos you can store original-resolution images and videos in the cloud.

There are two important reasons to consider using iCloud Photos. First it makes it possible to access manage edit and share the same files across various devices including iPhone iPad Mac Apple TV Windows and the web. Second it helps limit the amount of local storage each device needs to store photos which is very important for devices with smaller storage capabilities.

Check out our iCloud Drive review and five tips on how to free up iCloud storage space.

History of iCloud Photos

Apple's overreaching iCloud storage and computing service was launched in late 2011. It replaced MobileMe a limited-use service that acted as a data syncing center for user emails contacts calendars bookmarks photos etc.

The iCloud service has many different uses with more added each year including the ability to remotely store user data such as documents photos and music. The service is also used for backup purposes for Apple mobile devices including iPhones and iPad.

The iCloud ""cloud"" comprises a series of data centers owned by Apple Google and Amazon. These centers are mainly located in the United States although there are also ones in Denmark and China.

Every Apple user receives 5GB of free iCloud storage which is no longer enough for most users. Additional storage is available by subscribing to one of the three iCloud+ premium plans that start for as little as $0.99 per month.

Currently iCloud Photos supports HEIF JPEG RAW PNG GIF TIFF HEVC MP4 and Apple's specialty formats including slo-mo time-lapse and Live Photos.

Setting up the iCloud Photos Library

When setting up a new device you're asked whether to turn on iCloud Photos. Otherwise you'll need to set it up manually. First you must tap onto the Settings app on iPhones and iPad then choose the Apple ID banner at the top of the Settings page. Next select ""iCloud"" followed by ""Photos."" Next toggle on ""iCloud Photos.""

Depending on the number of images and videos on your device it may take some time to complete the iCloud Photos sync process. So that there are no problems make sure your device is connected to a Wi-Fi connection and is sufficiently charged.

After iCloud Photos is turned on the Camera Roll album gets renamed ""All Photos.""

Right under the toggle for iCloud Photos is a choice of two settings: ""Optimize iPhone Storage"" and ""Download and Keep Originals."" Most folks should select the first option since it will significantly limit the amount of storage used on the device. The second choice only makes sense if your library is small or the available storage on the device is significant.

When the ""Optimize Photo Storage"" option gets selected Apple will automatically manage the size of your library on the device. The library only gets optimized when you need space. When more space is required the photos and videos you access the least are the first to get optimized.

Turn on the iCloud Photos feature on all your devices to fully maximize its benefits.

Accessing editing and deleting iCloud Photos

Once set up iCloud Photos are accessible and synced across supported devices. Users can find these files in the native Photos app or through iCloud.com. Every time a new photo or video gets created on a device it's automatically uploaded to Apple's servers. In addition the content gets synced to other devices that use the same account.

On mobile launch the Photos app then choose the Albums tab at the bottom. You can also search for images and videos using a keyword location or by time.

When you click on a photo via the Photos app it will automatically download in full resolution from iCloud. You can then edit the file just like any other image or video. You can also delete a photo by selecting it then choosing the recycling can at the bottom right-hand side.

Changes to a file on one device are reflected on other devices logged into the same Apple ID and have iCloud Photos turned on. This includes the deleting of images or videos. Luckily there's a 30-day window to recover deleted files. You can find deleted pictures and videos in the Recently Deleted folder inside the Photos app. Click on the files you wish to recover then choose ""Recover"" at the bottom right.

To delete photos and videos sooner go into the Recently Delete folder in the Photos app then choose the files you wish to delete. Finally click ""Delete (number) items"" to finish the process.

Downloading copies of your photos and videos

If you need to download all the photos from iCloud onto your mobile device you can do so. However it's not recommended you have a lot of free storage on your device.

Go into the Settings app to download all the files then tap Apple ID. Next choose ""iCloud"" followed by ""Photos."" To stop using iCloud Photos un-toggle the iCloud Photos setting. All the photos and videos from iCloud will be downloaded to your device in full resolution.

If you want to continue to sync your photos via iCloud and also want to download full-resolution versions on your device you'll have to follow some simple steps. Once again go into the Settings app then tap ""Apple ID."" Next choose ""iCloud"" followed by ""Photos."" Next select ""Download and Keep Originals."" New media will get synced to iCloud and downloaded full-resolution versions will remain on the device.

About iCloud backups

Syncing images and videos through iCloud Photos isn't the same as performing an iCloud backup. The former is for real-time syncing between devices.

The latter provides a one-way backup of the current photo library on your device. If you need to restore the backed-up photos you must restore the entire iCloud backup.

About iCloud storage and how to purchase more

Apple's iCloud is designed to store different data types that go beyond photos and videos. This includes iCloud Drive files apps contacts calendars mail notes reminder data backups and uploaded tracks from the iCloud Music Library.

As already noted every iCloud user receives 5GB of free storage. If that's not enough you can buy extra space through one of the iCloud+ subscription plans. For $0.99 per month there's the iCloud+ with 50GB storage plan; for $2.99 you get 200GB each month; for $9.99 you receive 2TB. Each iCloud+ plan which includes more than just iCloud Storage allows you to share everything with five other family members.

You can easily purchase more iCloud Storage via your iPhone or iPad by going into the Setting app then choosing your Apple ID at the top. Next select iCloud > Manage Storage. Then on the next page choose ""Change Storage Plan.""

Sharing iCloud Photos

Using the built-in share sheet you can share iCloud Photos just as you would any other file on iPhones and iPad. If you want to share files with multiple people and even offer collaboration consider creating a shared album.

With a shared album you can group different photos and videos for other folks to see. You can easily add new items to the album make changes or delete content with ease. You can also decide whether others can do the same or limit them to only being allowed to view the content of the shared album.

To create a shared album on your Apple mobile device tap on the Settings app then select your Apple ID at the top. Next choose “iCloud” followed by “Photos.” Finally toggle on “Shared Albums.” Choose the “+” at the top left in the Photos app and select “New Shared Album.” Add a name for the shared album in the box then tap “Next.” Add those to invite to share the album by adding their email or phone number. At this point they’ll receive an invitation to join the shared album.

Choose the shared album you just created then tap the box marked with an “+” and add your first photo or video. Repeat to add additional files.

By default everyone invited to the shared album will be able to add edit and delete content. If you want to change this setting tap the user icon at the top right of the main shared album page in the Photos app. Then untoggle “Subscribers Can Post.” You can also decide whether anyone can view the album through the iCloud website (off by default) or if you should get notifications when someone likes comments or adds photos or videos to this shared album (on by default).

What is My Photo Stream?

If you aren't using iCloud Photos there's another way to access photos from devices using the same Apple ID. My Photo Stream works with the basic iCloud service and automatically stores up to your most recent 1000 images in the cloud for 30 days. You can access them from supported Apple devices including iPhone iPad Mac Windows and Apple TV.

Photos you take on a supported device are automatically uploaded to iCloud with My Photo Stream when connected to Wi-Fi. You can also set My Photo Stream so that images are only uploaded manually.

You can manually download smaller-resolution images from My Photo Stream to other devices. For example you've recently taken four snapshots with your iPhone on vacation. When you return to your hotel that evening your iPhone and iPad connect to the same Wi-Fi network. So you'll see those four photos in the Photos app on both devices once they upload to the cloud from the iPhone. However they aren't stored on the iPad; they are only viewable.

You can download those files to the iPad in a smaller resolution. On your Mac or PC your photos download in full resolution. With My Photos Stream photo edits don't update across your devices.

If you decide to turn off My Photo Stream on a device you're asked whether you want to download those photos to the individual device. If this wasn't the original device for which the images were captured they'd no longer be available for viewing.

My Photo Stream is an old service and it's one Apple will probably eventually retire. Already it's no longer available on devices that use iCloud Photos. Additionally it's not an option for anyone with a new Apple ID.

For those who do have the option of using My Photo Stream it's an excellent service especially for those with a small photo library who rather not pay for additional iCloud storage.

iCloud alternatives

If you're exclusively using an Apple device and don't have a problem paying extra for storage an iCloud membership is probably the best choice especially if you have a large photo and video library. However if you have some Windows or Android-based machines other cloud-based photo services should be considered such as Google Photos Flickr Adobe Creative Cloud Portfolio etc.

XOM,ExxonMobil,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL2xpYmVydHktbXV0dWFsLWJvYXJkLW1lbWJlci1qdXN0LWJlY2FtZS10aGUtbmV3LWxlYWQtZGlyZWN0b3Itb2YtZXh4b25tb2JpbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liberty Mutual Board Member Just Became the New Lead Director of ExxonMobil,"The board of one of the world’s largest insurance companies has numerous ties to fossil fuel and extractive industries.

By now it’s no secret: insurance companies can play a key role in helping the world steer away from mounting climate catastrophe by refusing to underwrite the expansion of dirty oil gas and coal infrastructure. That’s why climate advocates environmental justice organizers and concerned stakeholders have been escalating their demands on big insurers to stop propping up the fossil fuel industry and all its associated climate and financial risks.

Few insurance corporations are bigger and have more of a responsibility to act on climate than Liberty Mutual. That’s why it’s so alarming that Liberty Mutual board member Joseph “Jay” Hooley just became the new Lead Director of ExxonMobil perhaps the most powerful Big Oil supermajor on the planet.

ExxonMobil is one of the largest fossil fuel companies in the world. It is directly responsible for driving our global climate catastrophe as well for actively stalling climate progress for decades. Hooley joined ExxonMobil’s board of directors at the beginning of 2020 — and now as ExxonMobil’s Lead Director he is moving up the ranks to lead that board and oversee the governance of one of Big Oil’s top multinational powerhouses.

In this new role Hooley will be responsible for ensuring that ExxonMobil continues to rake in profits from its core business of oil and gas extraction and production for decades to come. He will also continue to earn compensation that gives him a personal financial interest in seeing ExxonMobil’s business boom. Hooley currently owns 13000 shares of ExxonMobil — worth well over $1 million — and his stake in the company is only set to grow. Hooley has a clear personal financial interest in seeing the company’s core business expand.

All this presents a grave conflict for Liberty Mutual where as a board member Hooley is in charge of governing the insurance powerhouse as it navigates a future of climate chaos and climate risk. While not nearly sufficient Liberty Mutual has made gestures around climate by for example limiting insurance coverage for some coal-intensive companies and pledging a 50% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Hooley’s governing role and financial interest in a global Big Oil powerhouse raises major concern over whether he can help guide Liberty Mutual through even these minor commitments let alone toward the much bigger commitments that stakeholders and advocates demand.

Moreover Hooley’s oil and gas ties are just the most egregious of several other climate conflicts on Liberty Mutual’s board with well over half of the company’s board having personal financial ties and governing and executive responsibilities tied to fossil fuel interests and extractive industries.

All this presents a stark conflict at the heart of Liberty Mutual’s governance: how are board directors like Hooley supposed to responsibly guide one of the world’s biggest insurance companies through the demands of the climate crisis while simultaneously governing over and personally profiting from the expansion of climate-destroying fossil fuel operations?

Big Oil’s Lead Director: Hooley Takes the Helm at ExxonMobil

Jay Hooley became ExxonMobil’s new lead director following the annual stakeholder meeting on May 25th 2022. In this role Hooley will be the most powerful non-executive member of Exxon’s board which oversees the entirety of the corporation’s affairs. He will practically be running the show for ExxonMobil’s governing body.

Hooley’s responsibilities will include engaging with shareholders setting the agendas for and chairing executive sessions and leading the annual performance evaluation of the board among other key functions.

In serving as ExxonMobil’s lead director Hooley will be guiding a company dedicated to expanding its oil and gas production and promoting climate denialism to stall climate action.

ExxonMobil is one of the world’s most powerful and influential corporations. The company raked in over $14 billion in profits in just the last two quarters and it has pledged to leverage those profits into billions of dollars worth of stock buybacks. In the US Exxon is expanding its oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin the busiest oilfield in the world. Because of its decades of dedication to extracting and burning fossil fuels Exxon has been a main driver of carbon emissions into our environment that have accelerated the global climate crisis.

At the same time ExxonMobil has been a leading force in climate denialism for decades. We now know that for decades Exxon knew that carbon emissions were causing climate change. Not only did Exxon suppress this knowledge but it actively promoted climate denialism and tried to stall responses to climate change.

Hooley and ExxonMobil: A Major Conflict for Liberty Mutual

Considering all this one wonders how Hooley can justify serving on the board of Liberty Mutual while at the same time being responsible for guiding the board of one of the world’s biggest oil corporations whose core business deeply conflicts with climate goals.

ExxonMobil’s most recent annual report clearly states that the company’s “principal business involves exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas.” Moreover the “risk factors” identified in the report include increased climate regulation denial of oil and gas permits new efficiency standards and other measures that we need to address the climate catastrophe. It is clear that ExxonMobil sees new climate regulation as a core threat to its business.

Hooley also faces major climate conflicts around his personal financial stake in ExxonMobil. According to Exxon’s proxy statements Hooley took in $675311 in compensation in 2020 and $214295 in 2021 for a total of $889606 in compensation over the past two years. The bulk of this compensation was awarded in the form of stock awards. According to his most recent SEC disclosure Hooley currently owns 13000 shares of Exxon Mobil stock. These shares were worth $1227200 at the close of the U.S. stock market on May 24 2022 when Exxon’s share price closed at $94.40.

All this means that as ExxonMobil and the fossil fuel industry continue to profit from oil and gas operations so will Hooley. With Hooley’s personal stake in fossil fuels how can anyone trust him to also help oversee as a board member the climate demands that must be core to Liberty Mutual’s business in the years ahead?

Moreover Hooley’s position also raises concerns over conflicts if Liberty Mutual insures any fossil fuel projects that Exxon is connected to such as pipelines refineries or other infrastructure. With Hooley’s leading role at Exxon Liberty Mutual must disclose any business it conducts with ExxonMobil and assure stakeholders that Hooley is not personally profiting from this business or otherwise abusing his director role at Liberty Mutual to benefit Exxon.

It’s also worth noting that Hooley’s location at the intersection of finance and fossil fuels is not new. Before joining the boards of ExxonMobil and Liberty Mutual he was the President and CEO of State Street Corporation generally considered the world’s third largest asset manager. State Street drew extensive scrutiny around the time of Hooley’s tenure because of its massive fossil fuel portfolio.

Ironically while leading the board of a company that thrives on extractive industry and systems dependent on fossil fuels Hooley is also a director of Aptiv a self-proclaimed green tech company – once again showing how he’s swimming in conflicts of interest.

A Conflicted Board: Liberty Mutual’s Climate Governance Problem

Hooley is not the only example of conflicts of interest at the core of Liberty Mutual’s governance when it comes to climate issues and the fossil fuel industry. As an extensive 2021 DeSmog investigation showed Liberty Mutual’s board is awash in oil and gas ties.

Today an astounding 9 out of 13 Liberty Mutual board members – a whopping 69% – have close ties to and are personally profiting from extractive industries. These include:

Annette Verschuren began her career in the coal industry with the Cape Breton Development Corporation a coal mining company and currently serves as a director of Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL). CNRL continues to extract fuel from the country’s highly polluting tar sands.

Francis A. Doyle William C. Van Faasen and David H. Long (who is also CEO and Chairman of Liberty Mutual) are all current trustees of Eversource Energy. Eversource is a massive utility in the Northeast of the US that is expanding gas infrastructure across the region. According to Eversource’s proxy filings the three directors have collectively taken in $5.5 million from Eversource during their times as directors.

Martin Slark is a board member of Koch Industries one of the largest private companies in the US that does major business in oil and gas refining petrochemicals and pipelines. The company’s owners have long fueled climate denialism and opposed clean energy.

Eric Spiegel is a director of Dover Corporation which produces multiple products for oil and gas operations. Spiegel spent years consulting for the oil and gas industry as a former Managing Partner for Global Energy Chemicals and Power at Booz & Company (now Strategy&) and Booz Allen where he “worked with major energy clients” and is a former Associate in the Energy and Industrials Practice at Temple Barker & Sloane (now Oliver Wyman). He also serves as Executive Chairman of EN Engineering “a leading engineering services firm serving the automation utility and oil and gas industries.”

Nancy Quan is Chief Technical and Innovation Officer for the Coca-Cola Company one of the world’s biggest drivers of plastic waste. In 2020 #BreakFreeFromPlastic advocacy group ranked Coca-Cola as the “#1 Top Global Polluter.” The production of plastics for use with consumer products is rooted in fossil fuel production particularly fracking. According to an investigation conducted by Greenpeace Coca-Cola buys packaging directly from manufacturers supplied with plastic resin or petrochemicals by companies like ExxonMobil.

Anne Walenski is a director of Tredegar Corporation a global manufacturer of plastic films and aluminum extrusions that goes so far to state in its most recent annual report that disruptions to petrochemical production are a big risk to its business.

These conflicts could be a reason that despite Liberty Mutual’s acknowledgement that “fossil fuels are the driving factor contributing to climate change” it does not address the imperative for ending fossil fuel expansion and phasing out coal oil and gas business in its most recent sustainability reports. Beyond its existing coal policy Liberty Mutual does not rule out insurance of new oil and gas projects nor does it outline practical timelines or steps to phase out insuring sectors that are carbon-intensive energy sectors. Liberty also does not address Indigenous rights or other human rights impacts from the projects it insures.

By contrast ten major insurers have policies restricting insurance for new oil and gas projects thirteen insurers have adopted restrictions on insuring oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and more than fifteen have restricted support for the tar sands oil sector.

What Will Liberty Mutual Do?

Companies like Liberty Mutual fuel climate change and environmental injustice when they insure and invest in fossil fuel projects and companies. Given the severity of the climate catastrophe and the imperative to limit global warming to meeting the 1.5ºC goal these firms must stop insuring fossil fuel expansion immediately phase out existing fossil fuel insurance contracts in line with 1.5ºC and divest from shares and bonds in those companies.

For Liberty Mutual the urgency of implementing such policies – or taking any real action around climate – faces conflicting pressures and interests when its board members are directly governing oil and gas companies and benefiting from the fossil fuel industry’s expansion.

Jay Hooley’s position as lead director of ExxonMobil while also serving as director of Liberty Mutual raises these exact concerns. Hooley plays a governing role for a Big Oil supermajor whose core business is in oil and gas and which sees increased climate regulation as a threat to its profits. Hooley is also personally profiting from Exxon’s business through his board compensation and stock ownership. At the same time he is playing a governing role for Liberty Mutual when the insurance giant is under pressure to take meaningful action on our climate crisis and address climate risks.

To have any real faith that Liberty Mutual can lead on climate – the most crucial issue any insurance company is facing in the midst of the climate catastrophe – the company must address the egregious climate conflicts at the core of its governance.

Investigates Basquiat Paintings Shown at Orlando Museum of Art (Published 2022),"The ongoing cultural fascination with the life and work of Jean-Michel Basquiat shows little signs of dimming whether it’s in the form of brisk sales for $29.99 Basquiat-themed T-shirts at The Gap large crowds for Basquiat’s latest art exhibitions or an actual canvas by the painter auctioned last week for $85 million.

To the ranks of those focused intently on all things Basquiat you can now add the F.B.I.

The F.B.I.’s Art Crime Team is investigating the authenticity of 25 paintings that the Orlando Museum of Art says were created by Basquiat and are on exhibit there according to a federal subpoena and several people with knowledge about the situation.

The paintings in the “Heroes & Monsters: Jean-Michel Basquiat” exhibition were said by the museum and their owners to have been recovered from a Los Angeles storage unit in 2012. The works were largely unseen before the show’s February opening. An article in The New York Times raised questions about their authenticity reporting that a designer who had previously worked for Federal Express had identified the FedEx typeface on a piece of cardboard Basquiat was said to have painted on as one that was not designed until 1994 — six years after the artist’s death.

The paintings’ owners and the museum’s director and chief executive Aaron De Groft say the paintings are genuine Basquiats citing statements from art world experts commissioned by the owners. And the chairwoman of the museum’s board Cynthia Brumback has publicly supported De Groft. The paintings are set to leave the museum on June 30 for public exhibitions in Italy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy51ZWZhLmNvbS91ZWZhY2hhbXBpb25zbGVhZ3VlL25ld3MvMDI3NS0xNTQxNWRkZTBiZjYtMThhNTFkZDdkZWVkLTEwMDAtLWthcmltLWJlbnplbWEtdG9wcy0yMDIxLTIyLWZlZGV4LXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLXpvbmUtcmFua2luZ3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Karim Benzema tops 2021/22 FedEx Performance Zone rankings,"Karim Benzema has ended the campaign comfortably clear in the FedEx Performance Zone rankings after managing 15 goals and an assist in his 12 UEFA Champions League outings.

Ford showed up for the fight and was in it right to the end as Chase Briscoe hounded Kyle Larson for the lead in the closing laps. Briscoe was able to get alongside briefly but never made the pass. His last gasp came with two laps to go as he drove it deep into turn one and two on the inside lane but immediately spun out.

That set the stage for overtime where Joey Logano was sitting third for the restart but another caution – the 18th of the night – came as the field rumbled off turn four and collected the No. 22 Shell/Pennzoil Mustang ending his night.

Kevin Harvick was the next driver up as he filled the third spot but was never able to mount a charge on the final restart and held off Briscoe who rallied to finish fourth.

Michael McDowell ended up eighth his fourth top-10 finish in the last six races while Harrison Burton survived the attrition for a season-best 11th-place run.

Multiple Ford drivers were collected in either accidents or blown tires including Austin Cindric Ryan Blaney Ryan Preece and Chris Buescher who ended up flipping and landing on his roof after hitting something in the turf infield but emerged uninjured.

KEVIN HARVICK No. 4 Mobil 1 Ford Mustang

HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE A NIGHT LIKE THIS?

“We went to the back five times for bad pit stops too but everybody on our Mobil 1 Ford Mustang team did a good job. We just kept battling. We had a decent car after I hit the wall I got a lot tighter and then every time we’d make it up we’d just fall on our face on pit road and go to the back again. We just kept battling. That’s just kind of the name of the game in this particular race because it’s just so long. I knew the attrition was gonna be high.”

TALK ABOUT YOUR RACE.

“Our race was atrocious. We went to the back eight times but everybody on our Mobil 1 Ford just kept plugging away and we wound up in a good position there at the end and wound up with a good finish but it was ugly. Everybody’s night was ugly for the most part.”

HOW DID IT FEEL AT THE END WITH ALL THE RESTARTS?

“I’ve been to this race a lot and I knew that the way the mile and a half races had gone this particular year that it was gonna be a war. There weren’t as many tire issues as I thought there were going to be but it wound up just being spin outs because the cars would just become an incredibly big handful as you’d get towards the end of the run. You just had to hang on to it and it was definitely interesting to say the least.”

HOW WAS THE NEXT GEN CAR IN SUCH A LONG RACE?

“I think for me it was just every lap was kind of the same. You just kind of kept grinding away.”

CHASE BRISCOE No. 14 Mahindra Tractors Ford Mustang

HOW DID YOU FINISH FOURTH AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED?

“We just had a really really good Mahindra Tractors Ford and just super proud of everybody at SHR. We’ve obviously struggled really bad the last month and a half and to have a good car like that today and had a car capable of winning and I threw it away plain and simple. I’m glad we were able to at least get back to fourth. It’s unfortunate. There are 100 different things I would have done differently if I could re-do it again but obviously you’re racing in the moment and made a mistake and went too far. We’ll come back next week and see if we can cap it off.”

TALK ABOUT YOUR RACE.

“In the daytime we kind of struggled and I think a lot of that was just the sun. I was kind of timid around the fence. We kept getting track position. On restarts we were really really good but I could never get clean air. I felt like if I could have got ahead of the 1 I was a little bit better on the long run. I could have maybe held him up on the short run. I had a shot at him. We threw a couple sliders and then the 5 was able to get out front and kind of the same thing our car was really good on the long run. It seemed like if the guy could take the wall away from you it was just really hard to do anything but my car was really good almost one lane off and I just kept working Kyle really hard and waiting for him to make a mistake but he’s the greatest of all-time in my opinion. He just doesn’t make very many mistakes. I was able to drive it in so much deeper into one than him kind of all race long and felt like that was my opportunity if I could just get to his left-rear quarter panel on exit I would typically make people tighter. I drove in just as deep as I had been the whole race and I don’t know if he came off the wall because he’d been running so close on entry and as soon as I drove in there it just spun me out right away. I’m glad we were able to get back to fourth but we definitely had a lot better race car than fourth.”

DID IT FEEL LIKE BRISTOL DIRT ALL OVER AGAIN?

“I’m sure it looked the same. The move was totally different. With Reddick I was going in there to try to get there and I didn’t have an opportunity to get there where with Kyle I knew there was no way I was gonna drive in there and clear him. I was just trying to get in there to where I could get to his left-rear on the exit because you can’t follow the guy into the corner. You just get so tight. Like I said he was lifting so much earlier to run the fence that I could just drive it in there so much deeper typically. There were a couple times I was literally inches away from getting there and I couldn’t get there and then that last time I think it was two to go I was like ‘Well this is my last chance to try to get to his left-rear’ and I drove in there and like I said just kind of spun out as soon as I went into the corner. I wish I could do it all over again. There are 100 different things I’d do different those last 30-40 laps and I just was running 110 percent. I probably should have been running 95.”

HOW DOES THIS RACE COMPARE TO PAST 600s?

“I’ve only ran one race here in the past in the Cup car but to me that was the most fun Charlotte race I’ve ever ran. The racetrack was awesome. You could run the fence. You could run the middle. You could run the bottom. You could throw sliders. This car it seems like the long run and short run cars we have a little bit more of that where in the past it seemed like we kind of got single-filed out. It was a lot of fun. I’d do another 600 miles for sure.”

MICHAEL MCDOWELL No. 34 FR8Auctions.com Ford Mustang

“We had a really fast FR8 Auction Ford Mustang. Unfortunately we got too much damage in that wreck that big pile up when the 6 spun with somebody. That kind of took a little speed out of our race car but we did a good job working really hard trying to get the balance back. Then a lot of attrition there at the end. It was a wild race and we got ourselves in position there. I’m proud of everybody. It’s another top 10. We keep clicking them off. We had good speed. We qualified in the top 10 and finished in the top 10 today so it’s good. It’s good to be disappointed with that. I thought we had a top five coming to the checkered there and got all stacked up there four-wide and got in the fence a little bit but we’ll take a top 10 and move on to Gateway.”

COLE CUSTER No. 41 Chicken Cock Whiskey Ford Mustang

“The team did a great job working on the car all night and keeping up with the track. I was really happy with what we had and it felt like we had made big gains and turned things around. I felt like we had a good shot at the end but it just ended up that we were in the wrong place at the wrong time. I really can’t wait to get to the track next weekend. We’re moving in the right direction and I’ve always loved racing at Gateway.”

CHRIS BUESCHER No. 17 Fifth Third Bank Ford Mustang

“We just got caught up in it with our Fifth Third Bank Mustang. Our team did a really nice job and made some huge gains through the weekend. I’m really proud of them. We had a good race car. We drove all the way into the top 10 and just got back a little bit there and got around cars that really hadn’t been and got caught up in a wreck. It’s unfortunate.”

TAKE US THROUGH YOUR FLIP.

“It’s not ideal by any means. I’m gonna be a bit sore tomorrow. I haven’t been upside-down in a really long time. The team did a really nice job. We had great speed and had a chance at this thing it just didn’t work out.”

ON THE SAFETY CREW’S JOB.

“I do appreciate them for helping me and setting it back over again so thank you to everybody working for not slamming it back. It was nice to be able to get out. The blood is rushing to your head a little bit. I guess I could have pulled the belts and fallen right to the ground but figured I’d just wait on them.”

BRAD KESELOWSKI No. 6 Kohler Generators Ford Mustang

“Something happened where Blaney got turned and I saw it and checked up and got wiped out from behind. I hate it for everybody at RFK. We unloaded and weren’t very good and we finally got the car good the run before this. We were driving forward and making passes and were almost into the top 10 and then get wrecked. We just can’t seem to catch a break.”

RYAN BLANEY No. 12 BODYARMOR Ford Mustang

“I was tucked up tight behind the 8 and he was kind of lower than I thought on the frontstretch and kind of ran through the turf and then got to one and jerked right and I think he was up behind the 99 and thinking he was gonna hit tha apron and I didn’t have time to kind of get right and I just kind of hit the apron and got me loose. I hate that other cars got tore up. I just didn’t really know where I was at being close to him and you kind of see that sometimes. I just hate that it tore us up”

AUSTIN CINDRIC No. 2 Menards/Cardell Ford Mustang

Involved in accident on lap 146. “We cut a left-rear tire down right on corner entry. There was absolutely no warning and unfortunately that was the lap I decided to run the bottom so a long distance to the wall and a pretty hard hit. We had a really really fast Menards/Cardell Ford Mustang. I was having fun. We had a fast car and fast cars usually climb up through the field running the top and running the bottom. It’s just unfortunate.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS9iZXN0LW5hc2Nhci1mb3JkLXdpbGwtc3RhcnQtc2l4dGgtZm9yLTIwMjItY29jYS1jb2xhLTYwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Nascar Ford Will Start Sixth For 2022 Coca-Cola 600,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://fordauthority.com/2022/05/best-nascar-ford-will-start-sixth-for-2022-coca-cola-600/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS9iZXN0LW5hc2Nhci1mb3JkLXdpbGwtc3RhcnQtc2l4dGgtZm9yLTIwMjItY29jYS1jb2xhLTYwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Big Apple residents and visitors can catch the gorgeous ""Manhattanhenge"" this Memorial Day weekend as the sun sets between buildings on Sunday (May 29) and Monday (May 30) particularly if you're around 14th 23rd 34th 42nd and 57th Streets.

The phenomenon occurs twice a year when the setting sun aligns with east-west oriented streets in New York City weather permitting. If you can't catch it the next opportunity will be July 12 and 13 according to EarthSky.

""Viewers can also witness the phenomenon from the Tudor City Overpass in Manhattan or Hunter's Point South Park in Long Island City Queens"" EarthSky stated.

""Regardless of where you watch the sunset"" EarthSky added ""make sure you're as far east as possible while keeping New Jersey in the background across the Hudson River to accentuate the effect.""

The name ""Manhattanhenge"" borrows from Stonehenge the famous English Neolithic monument whose sarsen stones and orientation with landmarks in the surrounding area are meant to reflect the movements of the sun according to monument caretaker English Heritage.

""If you were to stand in the middle of the stone circle on midsummer's day the sun rises just to the left of the 'Heel Stone' an outlying stone to the north-east of the monument"" English Heritage stated.

The winter solstice also has an alignment English Heritage added. ""On midwinter's day turning 180 degrees to face towards the south-west the sun would originally have set between the two uprights of the tallest [stone monument] at the head of the sarsen horseshoe.""

While the summer solstice tends to attract celebrants COVID conditions permitting archaeology suggests the winter solstice might have been more important in the Neolithic English Heritage said on another page. That's because Durrington Walls a settlement just 2 miles (3 km) from Stonehenge thought to host the monument's builders has extensive evidence of feasting during the colder months.

Many urban environments receive the same effect as Manhattan experiences at some point in the year due to the sun's orientation relative to the buildings EarthSky explained.

That's because the sunset's position on the horizon is always shifting because of the inclination of the Earth's axis to our orbit. Manhattan's city grid tends to be at 29 degrees east of true north to reflect the orientation of the island.

""At this time of year — between the March equinox and June solstice — the sunset point is shifting northward each day on the horizon as seen from around the globe"" EarthSky stated.

""It's the northward-shifting path of the sun that gives us summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere ... it's the shifting path of the sun that gives people various alignments of the sunset with familiar landmarks.""

They're trapped.

Two swarms of curious diverse space rocks — called Trojan asteroids — continuously journey around the sun one in front of the gas giant Jupiter and one behind. Jupiter and the sun's gravity have combined to lock the Trojans into this immutable orbit. The asteroids can't leave. It's a major reason why Trojan meteorites likely don't land on Earth meaning we don't have any samples of these distant still largely mysterious objects.

But planetary scientists are keenly interested in the story of the Trojans. They suspect these icy rocks are captured relics of our solar system's formation some 4 billion years ago. If so the Trojans are the smaller building blocks of planets. They can help tell us how Earth and the other planets came to be.

""This is the first reconnaissance of the Trojan swarms.""

""If we want to understand ourselves we have to understand these small bodies"" Hal Levison a planetary scientist who leads the unprecedented mission to investigate the Trojans told Mashable.

The mission named ""Lucy"" after the ancient remains of a fossilized human skeleton will visit six different Trojan asteroids over its 12-year mission. It launched in 2021. ""This is the first reconnaissance of the Trojan swarms"" Levison said.

Captured cosmic capsules

A looming question is how primordial chunks of our early solar system got trapped in swarms around Jupiter. A leading theory (based on simulations of the planets' formation) is that in the nascent solar system the now-distant giant planets (Jupiter Saturn Neptune and Uranus) were closer to the sun as opposed to being the far-off intensely frigid worlds they are today. Meanwhile smaller icy objects — the Trojans — formed beyond the planets in the outer realms of our solar system.

But around 880 million years after the solar system formed it underwent dramatic change for reasons still being investigated. The large planets became violently unstable explained Levison and reoriented themselves farther from the sun. This created an opening for outer objects (the Trojans) to ultimately get propelled near gravitationally-powerful Jupiter.

""That's when we think the Trojans got stuck"" said Levison.

They've orbited in swarms around Jupiter ever since. They're thought to be pristine solar system remnants from billions of years ago. And that's what makes them so valuable.

Planets grow by innumerable collisions amassing into the larger worlds we see today. The untarnished Trojans are the type of smaller rocky and icy objects that would have contributed to making planets. They are diverse ""fossils"" of planet formation Levison emphasized. If we want to know how Earth formed into the habitable cloudy lush world we know today we have to know what exactly formed it.

The Trojans hold those clues. We just have to get there.

The deep space mission

The Lucy spacecraft fitted with two huge solar panels is nearly 52 feet wide. To power its journey to the realm of Jupiter hundreds of millions of miles from the sun it needs to collect bounties of sunlight.

Most of the 12-year mission will involve traveling to and around the Trojans in a serpentine looping journey. The craft won't take any samples but will swoop in for some close fly-bys of the asteroids. In total the mission will closely observe the rocks with a slew of different cameras for just around 24 hours. The craft with vast distances to cover will be hauling through space and zooming by these objects.

""We're not going to be able to blink"" Levison said.

""We're not going to be able to blink.""

Lucy's powerful cameras including a spectrometer that can see what the asteroids are composed of will observe the rocks' composition mass and geologic history. They'll see how icy the Trojans are and how different they are from each other. Planetary scientists already know some are dark red and resemble some of the extremely distant objects found today in the outskirts of the solar system beyond Neptune.

Levison expects to be surprised by what Lucy beams back. The mission will give scientists unprecedented insight into how our solar system and humble blue planet evolved and matured into the eight-planet realm we see today. ""I can’t wait to see what mysteries the mission uncovers!"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement.

On a winding tour of the solar system Lucy will fly by its first Trojan in 2027 and its final one in 2033.

""We're going to be visiting a lot of these things"" Levison said.

SK On Co. South Korea’s leading electric vehicle battery manufacturer is expected to improve production capacity as its client Ford Motor Co. has started customer deliveries of the F-150 Lightning. F-150 Lightning is the US automaker giant’s first all-electric pickup truck model with 200000 units already reserved.Ford started production of the EV pickup trucks last month and has recently begun providing the cars to retail customers in the US auto industry sources said on May 29. The US automaker’s stock price will depend on the EV pickup truck’s monthly sales for a while the sources added.SK On’s business in the US is expected to benefit once production of the EV pickup truck model hits its stride. The Korean firm wholly owned by Korea's major energy company SK Innovation Co. is providing its EV battery NCM9 for the F-150 Lightning manufactured from its first plant in the US state of Georgia.NCM9 is a high-nickel battery made of 90% nickel with manganese and cobalt making up the remaining 10%. The higher the nickel the higher the energy and better battery output SK On said. The company is set to offer batteries with a capacity of 19.6 to 26.2 gigawatt-hour (GWh) once Ford completes production next year of all the 200000 reserved units.Ford is planning to provide 40000 units of F-150 Lightning this year and manufacture 150000 units next year. This indicates half of the annual capacity of SK On’s first plant in Georgia which will produce up to 9.8 GWh of batteries a year will be used for the EV pickup truck unit.SK On is set to bulk up the battery production by commencing operation of its second Georgia-based plant next year. In addition it will construct a third plant in Georgia with an annual capacity of 40 GWh aimed to begin operations in 2025. The 40 GWh is enough for 500000 EVs that can drive more than 500 kilometers on a single charge.SK On’s battery capacity sold to the global EV market rose to 6.3 GWh in the first quarter of 2022 from 2.6 GWh in the same period the previous year according to Korea’s energy market research firm SNE Research. SK On’s global EV market share rose to 6.6% in the first quarter from 5.3% the year previous thanks to sales expansion of Hyundai Motor’s IONIQ 5 and Kia’s EV6 EV models that install SK On’s batteries.Ford is expected to focus on F-150 Lightning production this year boosting SK On’s hopes for operation gains. The Korean company was in the red during the first quarter of this year posting 1.26 trillion won ($1.03 billion) in sales and 273.4 billion won in operating losses.Hyung-Kyu Kim and Han-Shin Park at khk@hankyung.com Jihyun Kim edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvdGhhdC10aW1lLWZvcmQtYnVpbHQtYS1ib2VpbmctdHVyYmluZS1wb3dlcmVkLXRodW5kZXJiaXJkLTE4OTgwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,That Time Ford Built a Boeing Turbine-Powered Thunderbird,"It's been more than 110 years since the first mass-produced automobile hit public roads and cars are still largely powered by piston engines. But carmakers have experimented with all sorts of solutions in the past including gas turbine powerplants of the aircraft variety.

The Chrysler Turbine Car is perhaps the most iconic example. The project began in the mid-1950s with a turbine-powered Belvedere and morphed into a Chrysler of unique design by 1963. Mopar built 55 cars 50 of which were lent to the general public as part of a user program.The project was eventually canceled and all but nine cars were destroyed. But Chrysler wasn't the only American carmaker that ventured into gas turbine territory.General Motors also toyed with the idea through the Firebird a series of four prototypes/concepts it introduced between 1953 and 1959. But what about Ford the company that introduced the first mass-produced automobile in the early 1900s?Well FoMoCo's efforts in this department aren't as iconic as the Chrysler Turbine Car or the GM Firebird  but it also meddled with gas turbine engines.Its most known project is Big Red a turbine-powered experimental truck showcased in 1964. But it turns out that Ford actually put together its first turbine car almost a decade before that.It was essentially a Ford Thunderbird with an engine swap and used a Boeing 8C to move about. Developed between August 1955 and March 1956 shortly after the iconic Thunderbird made its debut the project remained a secret until 2022 when it was unveiled to the world by Ford archivist Ted Ryan.According to a report sheet that was published alongside an old photo of the car Ford's objective was to ""obtain experience with gas turbine engine packaging and operation"" as well as to obtain a ""usable and reliable"" turbine vehicle for ""appraising the special advantages and problems"" associated with this type of powerplant.The prototype itself wasn't radically different than a regular-production Thunderbird.While GM and Chrysler created unique vehicles for their gas turbine experiments  Ford simply stuffed a Boeing engine in the T-Bird's bay. The sheet mentions that the ""conventional front-engine installation"" was made using ""production components"" so there wasn't any wild engineering.Ford opted for a front exhaust system so the Thunderbird had massive pipes running through the lower front fenders. The picture also shows an additional sizable vent on the rear fender hinting at some sort of cooling system mounted in the trunk.The Boeing 8C turbine was rated at 175 horsepower which wasn't particularly powerful at the time. It actually produced less oomph than the Thunderbird 's 292-cubic-inch (4.8-liter) V8 mill which delivered up to 198 horsepower in 1955.Sadly there's no additional info about the turbine-powered T-Bird in terms of engineering but the sheet does include the company's conclusions after the experiment.Ford discovered numerous advantages including a good power-to-weight ratio good medium-speed acceleration and a lack of vibration. The turbine engine also needed ""relatively little routing maintenance"" compared to a piston powerplant.On the other hand testing also revealed ""serious acceleration lag in start-up"" and an ""undesirability"" of having a front-mounted exhaust. Needless to say the latter must have been a serious issue due to the noise and heat that must have entered the cabin even when the hardtop was in place.The project proved quite expensive. Ford spent $180000 on engineering labor and materials and an extra $8000 on maintenance. That's the equivalent of almost $2 million today which is a massive figure for a prototype built on an existing platform.Needless to say the turbine-powered Thunderbird did not go into production. The fate of the prototype is unknown but given that Detroit automakers had a habit to scrap experimental vehicles this T-Bird was probably destroyed. But it's cool to know that Ford once built a Boeing-powered sports car that actually ran.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvYXV0by9hdXRvLW5ld3MvdGF0YS1tb3RvcnMtZ2V0cy1ndWphcmF0LWdvdnQtbm9kLXRvLXRha2Utb3Zlci1mb3Jkcy1zYW5hbmQtcGxhbnQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTE4NjQ4NzUuY21z0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9hdXRvL2F1dG8tbmV3cy90YXRhLW1vdG9ycy1nZXRzLWd1amFyYXQtZ292dC1ub2QtdG8tdGFrZS1vdmVyLWZvcmRzLXNhbmFuZC1wbGFudC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTE4NjQ4NzUuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tata Motors gets Gujarat govt nod to take over Ford's Sanand plant,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

WOKE UNIVERSITIES' NEWEST SOCIAL JUSTICE CRUSADE: FIGHTING ‘FATPHOBIA’

STEVE HILTON: This is where it all starts with academics and theorists and over time your local school board your employers HR department AOC teenagers they're all speaking fluent ‘woke.' The problem is the more they become indoctrinated the more authoritarian the whole thing gets until it's practically compulsory if you want to get anywhere in American society. And that is just about where we are today. But to fight back against ‘wokeism’ it is not enough just to rail against cancel culture or complain about woke corporations. We have to go to the source. The cure for the woke mind virus will be found in the very spot where society got sick in the first place. And that’s in the universities. Institutions of higher learning are incredibly influential whether we like it or not they incubate the leaders of society.

After centuries of doing that with exploration and expansion of human knowledge in just a few decades they have been transformed from places of open inquiry into centers of indoctrination. But in the great tradition of America if something is not working we don’t just moan about it we build something better.

The Academy Museum plans a permanent exhibition.

Carl Laemmle was born in 1867 in southwest Germany in the small picturesque town of Laupheim. He grew up in a prosperous family and developed a strong bond with his mother. He longed to leave Europe for the US but it wasn't until his beloved mother had died that he left Germany in search of the American Dream. He eventually found it in the Hollywood Hills.

The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures (AMMP) which opened last fall however didn't offer much on Laemmle or others like him — Jewish emigrants who founded Hollywood and its powerful film industry.

Critics say the diverse histories of the Jewish founders are missing or inadequately represented — ""a colossal miss"" according to Anti-Defamation League (ADL) head Jonathan Greenblatt an organization that advocates against the defamation of the Jewish people. ""Any honest historical assessment of the motion picture industry should include the role that Jews played in building the industry from the ground up"" Greenblatt told The New York Times.

The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures responded quickly. ""We were very interested to hear the feedback. It was a privilege and a learning experience"" curator Dara Jaffe told DW adding that they had ""an exhibition planned dedicated to the founding of Hollywood specifically a major aspect of the story.""

The museum rotates its exhibitions very frequently she said but the organizers decided ""that our visitors really wanted to see this story told in its concentrated form. So our decision was to make this exhibition permanent."" Jaffe will curate a permanent exhibition titled ""Hollywoodland"" about the origins of Hollywood and the lives of its founders.

'Devotion to their new country'

Carl Laemmle Adolph Zukor William Fox Louis B. Mayer and Harry Warner who laid the foundation of the Los Angeles film industry are all to be honored in Hollywoodland. And they all have one thing in common: ""... their utter and absolute rejection of their past and their equally absolute devotion to their new country"" as Neal Gabler put it in the 1988 book ""An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood.""

Mayer even chose July 4 as his birthday allegedly claiming the original birth records were lost.

""The birth of Hollywood itself is an immigrant story a specifically Jewish immigrant story"" Jaffe argued. ""Growing up in this country all the doors of high society were closed to them; there were only specific industries in which they were even allowed to participate and prejudice was a very very real and looming presence in their lives.""

Cinema was a very new invention already labeled as the entertainment of the masses she said adding that even some of the inventors didn't think ""it was going to become this huge industry.""

Laemmle Zukor William Fox Mayer and Warner some of whom had started their careers in the garment and furrier industries saw it as a chance.

Several of the founders noticed that nickelodeon theaters — simple cinemas that charged five cents for admission — could be the next big thing. ""They cleared out their storefronts put in a nickelodeon theater and then things took off from there"" Jaffe said.

Next they moved into distribution and then they realized that they should be producing films too Jaffe said: ""Then they founded their own studios to actually create the film content.""

'Creating their own American Dream'

Right from the start there were attempts to take away an industry from them that they had ""forged out of nothing"" said Jaffe.

The National Legion of Decency a Catholic organization dedicated to identifying objectionable content in movies tried to censor their films.

The Jewish film producers knew they would have to show a version of America that would be accepted but they also knew they had influence within those parameters.

The businessmen were first-generation Jewish Americans and very focused on assimilation said the curator: ""They wanted to be thought of as Americans not as Jews first and foremost.""

They reinvented themselves creating their own American Dream she said while at the ""same time creating the American Dream that was to become synonymous with Hollywood's American Dream the version of America that you see on the screens.""

The new permanent exhibition is to present the history and lives of the founders as well as answer the question of why Los Angeles became the birthplace of Hollywood.

The early producers will be honored as well as other Jewish pioneers who fled from Germany Austria and other European countries to the US in the 1930s and 1940s to flee Nazi persecution and also left their mark on Hollywood.

Among them are of directors Fritz Lang Fred Zinnemann and Otto Preminger actors including Hedy Lamarr Peter Lorre and Paul Henreid producers Eric Pleskow and Sam Spiegel screenwriters Vicki Baum Gina Kaus and Salka Viertel and Erich von Stroheim as well as composers Erich Wolfgang Korngold Ernest Gold Max Steiner Miklos Rozsa and Franz Wachsmann.

Lori Fox likened it similar to after a car crash when days later the reality of the experience floods in and the panic and craziness of it all sinks in. That’s how Fox views the nervous breakdown that occurred upon completion of their book.

The book This Has Always Been a War: The Radicalization of a Working Class Queer was released May 3. It is Fox’s first book an accolade that sits atop an impressive pile of essays articles stories and newspaper clippings from prominent national and international publications (which includes writing for the News.)

Fox’s breakdown documented in a personal re-telling published in the Globe and Mail is aimed squarely at a system that fails to provide mental health services to working-class people. Denied therapy and proffered prescriptions for drugs that didn’t work Fox spiraled into a near miss of self-destruction.

And Fox unlike most doesn’t keep quiet about it.

“That we have this two-tiered system is a disgrace. The way we treat people who cannot afford to pay for private care is a disgrace. What happened to me – what is happening to other people even as I write this – is a disgrace.”

Fox is a freelance journalist a gig worker a labourer a server a 30-something working class person struggling to make rent. Rent that is only going up and up. A chapter is titled “Other People’s Houses rent is documented by dollar value whether or not utilities were included and by year.” For homeowners the chapter is deliberately unsettling.

Fox came to the Yukon in 2012 and found work plentiful but the housing situation dire. During three years of being housing insecure Fox interviewed the former minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost while homeless and living in a van.

Fox told the News in an interview May 26 that they’d “watched the territory get more and more expensive and have less and less options for working class people over the last decade.”

Fox is critical of the Whitehorse elites the government workers and the resources extractors who congregate in the capital city. Fox cites the median household income disparity between Whitehorse’s $93600 and Ross River’s $45000 which is half of the median income of Whitehorse.

“Folks in the communities especially rural folks tend to make less money because they don’t have access to those government jobs” Fox says “The disparity is incredible.”

Fox’s heart lies with the working class people who labor in low paying jobs and do not own property. The dedication in the book reads: “For my people the working classes who cook the meals and pick the fruit who serve the tables and stock the shelves who work the gigs and deliver the orders. We are the makers and builders and doers of this world and all that is in it belongs to us.”

The book is Fox-raw: railing angry and exposed.

“The book is incredibly vulnerable. I’m incredibly blunt and really upfront with some very difficult things. And I pull no punches.”

They add “And that will not be a surprise to anyone who has ever read anything I’ve ever written”.

This Has Always Been a War is a mix of essays and stories some previously published many not. The book takes a longer view. The book looks back to childhood and why it matters and how the truths that came to be remain. And then can change.

Fox spreads their arguments through a read of incidents accidents and injustices; through jobs and locations linked together with perseverance and hard work.

Fox wields a pointy stick at systems of preference that ignores those without financial means skin tones other than white or varied genders and sexual orientations. A system that serves to make those most like it more comfortable.

For example reflecting upon Saltspring Island British Columbia Fox describes the split between the landowners and workers on the well-groomed island.

“It was an island of the rich and their servants.”

They described how that the only places to live were on landowners’ property who wanted labour in return for lodging.

In another chapter while thinning fruit in the B.C.’s Okanagan region Fox wrote “I just want to know why one man should have two houses and an orchard full of fruit when other people in his village don’t even have a bed and a place to keep their beer cold.”

But Fox looks beyond. A childhood chapter reveals the stubborn harshness of their brutish father yet recognizes that he is not just one thing. Fox understands the complexity of the human condition and a larger rationale of the systems that created it.

“There’s no one story no one straight narrative that can be told about a person no matter how much we would like there to be” Fox writes.

The book’s back-and -forth moves between specific events and huge ideas. Small incidents are juxtaposed with larger concepts.

Fox writes “Every little act of cruelty whether intentional or not makes us a little less than we were than we would have been. It takes something from us. That’s what patriarchy is. That’s what capitalism is.”

“We cannot be absolved of responsibility for our actions. It’s okay to buy sneakers made in sweatshops and to drive gas-guzzling carbon monoxide-spewing SUVs and to live guiltlessly on stolen land because that’s just how it is.”

Fox challenges the status quo and believes in our ability to change. They write: “So many things really are the way they are because we are taught — because we assume — that the way things are is the way things have to be.”

“The way the world is today right now is not the way it has to be.”

Not if the US example is anything to go by,"In 1953 the Communist East German regime quashed a widespread uprising and afterwards admonished the protesters saying the government had lost confidence in the people. In a famous satirical poem left-wing author Bertolt Brecht said that if so perhaps the government could dissolve the people and elect a new lot.

One guesses that after the recent Australian election News Corp would also like to elect a new public as the result highlighted its own irrelevance and how out of touch it is with the Australian mainstream. Rather than directly attacking the public though it aimed its vitriol at the Greens and the teal independents both of whom had wildly successful elections and against Labor which regained government from opposition.

So far the media company’s epic fail seems not to have occasioned any soul- searching. Indeed some in its stable – in a triumph of ideological fantasy over numeracy – have asserted the result was due to the Liberals moving too far “left”.

Questions remain about the future though: will the election lead News Corp to change either out of professional shame or in the interests of expanding its market share beyond the right-wing populist ghetto it inhabits? And how will it treat the incoming government?

Some insight might be gained from how the jewel in Murdoch’s crown his greatest commercial and political success of the past three decades Fox News covered the administrations of US presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden both of whose elections it had vehemently opposed.

The opposition to Obama from Fox’s commentators was immediate and unrelenting. Even before he took office after an economic setback during the global recession which had been going on for months Fox News star Sean Hannity said Obama was to blame because the prospect of his taking over had made wealthy people get out of the market.

On the day of the president’s inauguration Rush Limbaugh declared: “I hope he fails”. On day three Laura Ingraham declared “our country is less safe today”. The next day their new star Glenn Beck said Obama had ended the war on terror and a week later asserted the country was on a march towards socialism.

Over the next few years Fox gave oxygen to the “birther” issue. This was the claim that Obama was not born in America and so was not eligible to be president – that his birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii was fake. In two months in early 2011 Fox devoted 52 items to “birther” stories 44 of which featured the claim without any other view being put.

Fox also took decisive steps transgressing what others would consider professional boundaries in becoming directly involved in the formation of the Tea Party a right-wing movement that proclaimed it wanted to take their country back who demanded ever more right-wing candidates in the Republican Party. Not only did Fox give abundant publicity to their rallies its then most prominent star Glenn Beck spoke at numerous rallies.

This points to an interesting paradox: Fox News probably persuades few Democrats to change sides. Rather the biggest losers from Fox’s impact have been moderate Republicans as Fox has helped move the party ever more to the right.

Could it be that News Corp is having or will have a similar impact on the conservative side of Australian politics making it harder for the Liberals to develop sane policies on issues such as global warming?

After Biden’s election several Fox presenters supported Trump’s claims that the election was stolen that Trump had really won. This strikes at one of the fundamental pillars of democracy: that the vote count can be trusted.

More recently Fox has promoted an equally dangerous idea especially promoted by its highest-paid performer Tucker Carlson. This is known as the Great Replacement Theory. A long-term demographic trend in the US is that the proportion of whites is gradually declining as those of Blacks Latinos and other ethnic groups grow more quickly.

Carlson and others turn this into a conspiracy theory: that Democratic elites are seeking to force demographic change through immigration to replace the current electorate with new more “obedient” people from the Third World.

Carlson has made more than 400 references to this absurd conspiracy. In the past year these dangerous views have moved from the fringes with substantial proportions of Republicans agreeing with some aspects of the theory.

It is impossible to imagine a more moderate or centrist Fox News. Its business model is built on delivering a predictable product to its niche audience of alienated older whites mobilising their resentments over status anxiety cutting through the complexities of the modern world with simple affirmations of their prejudices.

Its most successful shows rarely attract more than 2-3% of the viewing public itself a shrinking percentage of the total population. But its mix of strong opinions and minimal expenditure on reporting has been wildly profitable.

There was a time when Rupert Murdoch had a shrewd populist touch and for reasons of both patronage and reputation aimed to be on the winning side in elections. Those days are gone. The past few decades have seen the “Foxification” of News Corp.

This does not mean we will see claims of electoral fraud or replacement theories in Australia. But it does mean that the company’s formula for commercial viability is giving a predictable product to a niche audience.

In turn this means that Murdoch’s outlets are now rusted-on supporters of right-wing parties and views indifferent to any electoral counter-currents. Many of his most prominent commentators have the consistency of a stopped clock.

WOKE UNIVERSITIES' NEWEST SOCIAL JUSTICE CRUSADE: FIGHTING ‘FATPHOBIA’

STEVE HILTON: This is where it all starts with academics and theorists and over time your local school board your employers HR department AOC teenagers they're all speaking fluent ‘woke.' The problem is the more they become indoctrinated the more authoritarian the whole thing gets until it's practically compulsory if you want to get anywhere in American society. And that is just about where we are today. But to fight back against ‘wokeism’ it is not enough just to rail against cancel culture or complain about woke corporations. We have to go to the source. The cure for the woke mind virus will be found in the very spot where society got sick in the first place. And that’s in the universities. Institutions of higher learning are incredibly influential whether we like it or not they incubate the leaders of society.

After centuries of doing that with exploration and expansion of human knowledge in just a few decades they have been transformed from places of open inquiry into centers of indoctrination. But in the great tradition of America if something is not working we don’t just moan about it we build something better.

The Academy Museum plans a permanent exhibition.

Carl Laemmle was born in 1867 in southwest Germany in the small picturesque town of Laupheim. He grew up in a prosperous family and developed a strong bond with his mother. He longed to leave Europe for the US but it wasn't until his beloved mother had died that he left Germany in search of the American Dream. He eventually found it in the Hollywood Hills.

The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures (AMMP) which opened last fall however didn't offer much on Laemmle or others like him — Jewish emigrants who founded Hollywood and its powerful film industry.

Critics say the diverse histories of the Jewish founders are missing or inadequately represented — ""a colossal miss"" according to Anti-Defamation League (ADL) head Jonathan Greenblatt an organization that advocates against the defamation of the Jewish people. ""Any honest historical assessment of the motion picture industry should include the role that Jews played in building the industry from the ground up"" Greenblatt told The New York Times.

The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures responded quickly. ""We were very interested to hear the feedback. It was a privilege and a learning experience"" curator Dara Jaffe told DW adding that they had ""an exhibition planned dedicated to the founding of Hollywood specifically a major aspect of the story.""

The museum rotates its exhibitions very frequently she said but the organizers decided ""that our visitors really wanted to see this story told in its concentrated form. So our decision was to make this exhibition permanent."" Jaffe will curate a permanent exhibition titled ""Hollywoodland"" about the origins of Hollywood and the lives of its founders.

'Devotion to their new country'

Carl Laemmle Adolph Zukor William Fox Louis B. Mayer and Harry Warner who laid the foundation of the Los Angeles film industry are all to be honored in Hollywoodland. And they all have one thing in common: ""... their utter and absolute rejection of their past and their equally absolute devotion to their new country"" as Neal Gabler put it in the 1988 book ""An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood.""

Mayer even chose July 4 as his birthday allegedly claiming the original birth records were lost.

""The birth of Hollywood itself is an immigrant story a specifically Jewish immigrant story"" Jaffe argued. ""Growing up in this country all the doors of high society were closed to them; there were only specific industries in which they were even allowed to participate and prejudice was a very very real and looming presence in their lives.""

Cinema was a very new invention already labeled as the entertainment of the masses she said adding that even some of the inventors didn't think ""it was going to become this huge industry.""

Laemmle Zukor William Fox Mayer and Warner some of whom had started their careers in the garment and furrier industries saw it as a chance.

Several of the founders noticed that nickelodeon theaters — simple cinemas that charged five cents for admission — could be the next big thing. ""They cleared out their storefronts put in a nickelodeon theater and then things took off from there"" Jaffe said.

Next they moved into distribution and then they realized that they should be producing films too Jaffe said: ""Then they founded their own studios to actually create the film content.""

'Creating their own American Dream'

Right from the start there were attempts to take away an industry from them that they had ""forged out of nothing"" said Jaffe.

The National Legion of Decency a Catholic organization dedicated to identifying objectionable content in movies tried to censor their films.

The Jewish film producers knew they would have to show a version of America that would be accepted but they also knew they had influence within those parameters.

The businessmen were first-generation Jewish Americans and very focused on assimilation said the curator: ""They wanted to be thought of as Americans not as Jews first and foremost.""

They reinvented themselves creating their own American Dream she said while at the ""same time creating the American Dream that was to become synonymous with Hollywood's American Dream the version of America that you see on the screens.""

The new permanent exhibition is to present the history and lives of the founders as well as answer the question of why Los Angeles became the birthplace of Hollywood.

The early producers will be honored as well as other Jewish pioneers who fled from Germany Austria and other European countries to the US in the 1930s and 1940s to flee Nazi persecution and also left their mark on Hollywood.

Among them are of directors Fritz Lang Fred Zinnemann and Otto Preminger actors including Hedy Lamarr Peter Lorre and Paul Henreid producers Eric Pleskow and Sam Spiegel screenwriters Vicki Baum Gina Kaus and Salka Viertel and Erich von Stroheim as well as composers Erich Wolfgang Korngold Ernest Gold Max Steiner Miklos Rozsa and Franz Wachsmann.

Lori Fox likened it similar to after a car crash when days later the reality of the experience floods in and the panic and craziness of it all sinks in. That’s how Fox views the nervous breakdown that occurred upon completion of their book.

The book This Has Always Been a War: The Radicalization of a Working Class Queer was released May 3. It is Fox’s first book an accolade that sits atop an impressive pile of essays articles stories and newspaper clippings from prominent national and international publications (which includes writing for the News.)

Fox’s breakdown documented in a personal re-telling published in the Globe and Mail is aimed squarely at a system that fails to provide mental health services to working-class people. Denied therapy and proffered prescriptions for drugs that didn’t work Fox spiraled into a near miss of self-destruction.

And Fox unlike most doesn’t keep quiet about it.

“That we have this two-tiered system is a disgrace. The way we treat people who cannot afford to pay for private care is a disgrace. What happened to me – what is happening to other people even as I write this – is a disgrace.”

Fox is a freelance journalist a gig worker a labourer a server a 30-something working class person struggling to make rent. Rent that is only going up and up. A chapter is titled “Other People’s Houses rent is documented by dollar value whether or not utilities were included and by year.” For homeowners the chapter is deliberately unsettling.

Fox came to the Yukon in 2012 and found work plentiful but the housing situation dire. During three years of being housing insecure Fox interviewed the former minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost while homeless and living in a van.

Fox told the News in an interview May 26 that they’d “watched the territory get more and more expensive and have less and less options for working class people over the last decade.”

Fox is critical of the Whitehorse elites the government workers and the resources extractors who congregate in the capital city. Fox cites the median household income disparity between Whitehorse’s $93600 and Ross River’s $45000 which is half of the median income of Whitehorse.

“Folks in the communities especially rural folks tend to make less money because they don’t have access to those government jobs” Fox says “The disparity is incredible.”

Fox’s heart lies with the working class people who labor in low paying jobs and do not own property. The dedication in the book reads: “For my people the working classes who cook the meals and pick the fruit who serve the tables and stock the shelves who work the gigs and deliver the orders. We are the makers and builders and doers of this world and all that is in it belongs to us.”

The book is Fox-raw: railing angry and exposed.

“The book is incredibly vulnerable. I’m incredibly blunt and really upfront with some very difficult things. And I pull no punches.”

They add “And that will not be a surprise to anyone who has ever read anything I’ve ever written”.

This Has Always Been a War is a mix of essays and stories some previously published many not. The book takes a longer view. The book looks back to childhood and why it matters and how the truths that came to be remain. And then can change.

Fox spreads their arguments through a read of incidents accidents and injustices; through jobs and locations linked together with perseverance and hard work.

Fox wields a pointy stick at systems of preference that ignores those without financial means skin tones other than white or varied genders and sexual orientations. A system that serves to make those most like it more comfortable.

For example reflecting upon Saltspring Island British Columbia Fox describes the split between the landowners and workers on the well-groomed island.

“It was an island of the rich and their servants.”

They described how that the only places to live were on landowners’ property who wanted labour in return for lodging.

In another chapter while thinning fruit in the B.C.’s Okanagan region Fox wrote “I just want to know why one man should have two houses and an orchard full of fruit when other people in his village don’t even have a bed and a place to keep their beer cold.”

But Fox looks beyond. A childhood chapter reveals the stubborn harshness of their brutish father yet recognizes that he is not just one thing. Fox understands the complexity of the human condition and a larger rationale of the systems that created it.

“There’s no one story no one straight narrative that can be told about a person no matter how much we would like there to be” Fox writes.

The book’s back-and -forth moves between specific events and huge ideas. Small incidents are juxtaposed with larger concepts.

Fox writes “Every little act of cruelty whether intentional or not makes us a little less than we were than we would have been. It takes something from us. That’s what patriarchy is. That’s what capitalism is.”

“We cannot be absolved of responsibility for our actions. It’s okay to buy sneakers made in sweatshops and to drive gas-guzzling carbon monoxide-spewing SUVs and to live guiltlessly on stolen land because that’s just how it is.”

Fox challenges the status quo and believes in our ability to change. They write: “So many things really are the way they are because we are taught — because we assume — that the way things are is the way things have to be.”

“The way the world is today right now is not the way it has to be.”

Note: This article was first published on 23 May 2022.

It’s been a really long time (2.5 years to be precise) since Singapore has a proper offline IT fair and the organiser for the first-ever 2022 one is the most unlikely of the bunch.

Lazada is running a week-long Grand Online Tech Show at the atrium in Plaza Singapura from 23 May to 29 May 2022 with 24 partnered brands on site. That doesn’t yet include the online-only retailers taking part in Lazada’s gadgetry festival.

Visitors can expect to find brands like Vivo Logitech Lenovo Garmin Razer Sony Prism+ Microsoft ASUS Huawei Braun Jabra Seagate and many more at the fair. What’s also amazing is the number of new and upcoming products seen at the stalls.

For example we spotted the Sony WH-1000XM5 right next to its predecessor giving visitors an opportunity to make comparisons between both models at the show grounds. Also spotted is the flagship-grade Vivo X80 Pro smartphone which is a brand-new device that was only just announced for the global market last week. Other very new gadgets include the DJI Mini 3 Pro drone and ASUS’s flagship ZenWiFi Pro XT12 mesh routers. All these are only just a few of the many new toys we’ve come across and it’s not including the massive discounts seen for older tech products.

One key difference is the mode of payment and gadget collection. Most brands showcasing products have QR codes on display that lead to their appropriate Lazada listing and payment is made through the Lazada platform. Products seen at the show are also expected to be delivered to your preferred address unless otherwise stated (e.g. the brand explicitly offers on-site collection right there and then).

As a Lazada-organised tech fair the event comes with on-site “flash deals” happening daily between 1 to 3PM and 7 to 9PM. Also available for competitive visitors is a Grand Turismo 7 Gaming Challenge organised by Logitech G where the driver with the fastest lap time can walk away with a Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel (winner selected after 29 May 2022).

For online shoppers purchasing an “eligible Grand Online Tech Show” item online between 10PM to 10AM allows them to redeem a cup of Toast Box hot coffee or tea at the redemption counter situated in the fairgrounds (limited to the first 200 redemptions per day).

A minimum spend of S$60 at the physical event qualifies shoppers with a chance at Lazada’s Grand Online Tech Show (GOTS) lucky draw. The top prize is a Prism+ Q55 Quantum Edition TV+ with Powerhouse Home Karaoke System Jukebox (total worth of S$2998). Second is a S$2287 prize consisting of an ErgoTune Supreme ergonomic chair with EverDesk+ Max adjustable standing table. The third prize is a Nitro Concepts S300 fabric gaming chair (worth S$369).

(WVLT/Gray News) - An Illinois man is accused of killing his father in a deadly shooting while the two were at a highway rest stop.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation reports law enforcement agencies were called to a rest stop on Interstate 24 near mile marker 160 on Friday night regarding a fatal shooting.

WVLT reports authorities found the body of 55-year-old Michael Monroe Woods Jr. in the bathroom at the rest stop.

Investigators said they found the man’s son Micah E. McElmurry 30 responsible for his death and charged McElmurry with criminal homicide.

(Arizona’s Family/Gray News) - Two Canadian men are in jail after a traffic stop led to a massive drug bust in Arizona last week.

On May 18 an Arizona Department of Public Safety sergeant reported he pulled over a semi-truck driven by Albi Naska 36 with Victor Nikitin 36 as a passenger on Interstate 8 just west of Gila Bend.

Arizona’s Family reports the sergeant noticed suspicious behavior from the men and had his K-9 sniff the trailer.

The K-9 picked up a positive alert and the sergeant said he then searched the truck’s closet and sleep area. There he found over 50 packages of cocaine weighing a little more than 144 pounds.

According to authorities Naska and Nikitin face several felony charges including transportation possession and sale of drugs. They were arrested and booked into the Maricopa County Jail.

In the future the metaverse would be something similar to our real world in many aspects and even replace some real-world activities. — Abhay Aggarwal founder and CEO of Colexion an NFT marketplace If it remains fragmented the idea of a complete metaverse will never be achievable. — Anushree Verma director analyst at Gartner Going forward as technologies mature the metaverse is likely to disrupt the BFSI industry. — Dr Ashok Maharaj head of TCS XR Lab We anticipate industries such as gaming to take the lead in introducing the metaverse to the masses. — Kunal Purohit chief digital services officer Tech Mahindra

Nike is among the many companies that believe that metaverse is the future. While Big Tech has been investing heavily in building and expanding the virtual reality space others—from your grocery seller to Wall Street investments banks—are vying for a share of the future pie. And this has opened up a huge business opportunity for the Indian IT sector. For instance at the peak of the pandemic a global telecom giant sought the help of Tata Consultancy Services India’s largest IT company to revive its dipping sales. TCS proposed a 3D virtual showroom for the telecom company’s products. Anyone could access it on a smartphone and with the help of web-based augmented reality she could even hold mobile phone models in her hands before choosing one. It worked; the telecom company showed significant improvement in sales.

Abhay Aggarwal

Infosys and Tech Mahindra the second and fifth largest IT companies in the country respectively and a whole lot of startups are also gearing up to cash in on the opportunity. Research firm Gartner predicts that one in four people will be spending at least an hour a day in the metaverse by 2026. The market is predicted to reach $814 billion by 2028. Last year nine of every ten global organisations invested in technologies to create virtual environments and most of them are planning to invest further.

Meta a Greek word means ‘beyond’ and verse means ‘world’. But defining the metaverse is not as easy. Different platforms define it differently but in the larger sense it is a convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and enhanced virtual reality. “The metaverse functions as an equaliser between real and artificial life” said Girish Linganna director of ADD Engineering Components India. “One can build a virtual world and see the world in 3D using special glasses. In this artificially built world on the internet one can work play converse socialise or do anything. One can place advertisements to promote business hold business meetings play virtual games. It is driven by augmented reality (AR) with each user controlling a character on the screen. This concept is not entirely new; it exists in virtual video games where multiple elements or characters from physical life are brought to online worlds. This is the nearest example of the metaverse as of now.”

Anushree Verma

TCS has been investing in immersive ecosystems since 2018 and it offers a range of products and solutions in extended reality (XR) in industries such as retail BFSI and manufacturing. “The highlight of our work in metaverse is Avapresence which is a novel convergence of physical and digital worlds” said Dr Ashok Maharaj head of TCS XR Lab in Siruseri Chennai. “TCS Avapresence is helping organisations transform and disrupt how the physical world interacts with the digital. The platform is built on technology powered by TCS IP and its capabilities in cloud blockchain artificial intelligence and internet of things.”

The pandemic was a boost for the the company’s virtual reality business especially in functions such as remote collaboration troubleshooting help and support. “We feel that sectors such as retail education media and real estate have been the first-movers in adopting the immersive ecosystem space. We expect that other domains like fashion food and beverages life sciences and health care automobile manufacturing and construction will start using metaverse technologies to improve delivery. Going forward as technologies mature the metaverse is likely to disrupt the BFSI industry” said Maharaj.

Dr Ashok Maharaj

Infosys’s metaverse foundry makes it easier for the customers of its clients to explore the metaverse. “The physical and virtual worlds are already smoothly and ubiquitously interwoven” said Ravi Kumar S. president Infosys. “The metaverse will deepen this overlap and in experiential ways that will create abundant space for business innovation.”

Several businesses have benefited from the Infosys foundry. In 2021 it helped overhaul the shopping experience at the Australian Open by offering fans an ‘extended reality store’. Customers could buy tees beach towels caps and racquets in the virtual world and then get them in the real world. Infosys also helped create the Australian Open 2021 Virtual Hub a digital platform for business partners.

Similarly in Paris Infosys did a virtual recreation of the Philippe-Chatrier the main court of the French Open at the Infosys fan zone. “During Roland-Garros fans got a chance to experience the thrill of their digital avatars stepping into a virtual world where they could interact with other fans in their digital forms and engage using virtual objects” said Stéphane Morel deputy CEO marketing business development French Tennis Federation.

Kunal Purohit

Tech Mahindra’s metaverse practice TechMVerse offers a combination of software and hardware that provides a three-dimensional visual experience. It is focused on solving business problems and driving monetisation across businesses. “We see a huge metaverse opportunity in India” said Kunal Purohit chief digital services officer Tech Mahindra. “We already see kids meeting in the metaverse and enjoying birthday parties. Events by well-known artists are already streamed on the metaverse with people joining in droves. We anticipate industries such as gaming to take the lead in introducing the metaverse to the masses.”

There are many smaller Indian players in the metaverse as well. The ShortGun metaverse platform initiated by Mumbai-based serial entrepreneur Jeet Chandan targets young adults by offering gaming shopping and investing opportunities. “We believe that India has the potential to build a platform that can serve as a model globally” said Vidhit Mehta co-founder of ShortGun. “We are working on this project in a phased manner. We are also in the development phase of our crypto shopping and banking platform. Over the next few years as the metaverse becomes more unified democratised and less fragmented it will be the businesses that adapted the earliest that come out the strongest.”

The metaverse is still evolving; so are the opportunities it offers. “In the future the metaverse would be something similar to our real world in many aspects and even replace some real-world activities” said Abhay Aggarwal founder and CEO of Colexion an NFT marketplace. “The future metaverse will also contribute towards the growth of the virtual economy where no single entity or community will regulate the economy and where disruptions are almost nil.”

There are however plenty of challenges as well. “The road to build a complete metaverse solution may hit a number of challenges” said Anushree Verma director analyst at Gartner. “If it remains fragmented the idea of a complete metaverse will never be achievable. Furthermore as each company tries to build its own version of the metaverse it will only have a chaotic and an indiscernible structure that will lack combinatorial benefits.”

Metaverse jobs

There are many areas that can be tagged as part of the metaverse ecosystem such as augmented reality virtual reality board support package (BSP) engineering computer vision unity 3D and blockchain. Data from Quess IT Staffing indicates that there has been an uptick in demand for engineers in skills related to the metaverse. From 2020-2021 to 2021-2022 demand increased exponentially for professionals with skills in blockchain (2100 per cent) unity 3D (1600 per cent) and board support package engineering (550 per cent). Other metaverse related skills such as Android cloud DevOps embedded software AR VR and computer vision also witnessed a surge in demand.

“To build the metaverse we need to build its enablers—network cloud AI computer vision blockchain robotics IoT user interfaces extended reality—as well as the hardware requirements. Therefore job opportunities in any of the mentioned technologies will see a boom” said Vijay Sivaram CEO Quess IT Staffing. “Aspects such as the implementation of 5G the global shortage of chips the power of new processors and other factors will also have an impact on scaling the metaverse.”

In the short term low-hanging technologies like augmented reality which have a presence in the market and readily available skilled talent will now have a wider reach as the metaverse proliferates. “AR games will be plentiful and wearable tech like Google Glass will see higher utilisation across enterprises. As integration of AR with new metaverse platforms rises the talent hiring pipeline will also witness a surge. More complex technologies that require sophisticated software and hardware will have a longer go-to-market duration” said Sivaram.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ybC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA1LzI2L3JhaWRlcnMtdi1lZWxzLXJvdW5kLTEyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NRL 2022: Match preview Raiders v Eels Round 12,National Rugby League respects and honours the Traditional Custodians of the land and pay our respects to their Elders past present and future.

LOUISVILLE Ky. — Contrast media a liquid dye injected before some CT scans and other tests is in short supply.

""It's not going to be something that's going to be resolved in the next few days even if Shanghai were to produce mass produced amounts"" Ashley Montgomery-Yates with UK Healthcare said.

It’s a problem happening more than 7000 miles away.

ABC News reports strict lockdowns due to COVID-19 in Shanghai have lasted months impacting production.

The dye produced at GE Healthcare's plant there is creating an international critical shortage.

""There's really two types of contrasts in the world probably 60% of people use this one by GE and 30 to 40% of people around the world use the other type and it's a one or the other"" Montgomery-Yates said.

Ashley Montgomery-Yates said contrast media like Omnipaque and Visipaque are used in CT scans and more to help highlight possible issues.

Well with GE Healthcare's main facility getting tied up in the lockdowns that meant a critical shortage for hospitals even here in the Bluegrass.

""How do you get it to America? How do you get it to the hospitals GE is now flying it over from China instead of boating and all those sorts of things to try to expedite the process"" Montgomery-Yates said.

She notes they're starting to ration their supply from what they could use a whole bottle for they're now splitting into 10-ml increments.

Hollie Poindexter from Jeffersonville Indiana has a six-year-old son named Koi who suffers from epilepsy.

Some of his tests require contrast media and Poindexter says they've seen them done with and without it.

""He had done the order with and without contrast he wanted both"" Poindexter said.

MRI's use another form of contrast that is seemingly not being affected right now however Poindexter says it is scary to know hospitals here have to rely on other countries for this dye that can be lifesaving in many cases.

""I think we could absolutely have more stuff made here to where we don't have to rely on so many countries"" Poindexter said.

We spoke with representatives at UofL Health and they told me they're actually not being affected but just across the street at Norton Hospital they say they are but they are working to conserve their stock so there is disrupt in patient care.

For those that are affected by the shortage they're wondering when will the supply chain go back to normal?

""What we've been told is probably just by July 1 that at least the production will be up to 100% but maybe not the supply and the distribution part"" Montgomery-Yates said.

For Montgomery-Yates she says they are having to even reschedule some patients who may be at major risk.

Saying they just want to make sure they have enough for moments that may not be expected.

We reached out to GE Healthcare and they say they are actively working to get production back up. You can read their statement here.

Photo Courtesy of ABC

In the “General Hospital” episode that aired on May 27 it is evident that Trina has found a new love interest Officer Rory Cabrera.

Actress Tabyana Ali has taken over the role of Trina Robinson on the hit daytime drama “General Hospital” and she has been killing it ever since. Actor Michael Blake Kruse plays the role of Officer Rory Cabrera who has been a pleasant and refreshing addition to the “General Hospital” cast.

While Trina was unable to secure a lounge in the Metro Court pool she sees Rory swimming in the Metro Court pool and she is blown away by him.

“You’ve made it” Rory tells her. “I was worried… things seemed really tense between you and Spencer when I left.”

“Is everything okay with Spencer?” the officer inquired. “Things are the same with Spencer. We don’t communicate very well” Trina admitted.

Trina acknowledged that this is her first time back in a pool and that she “may not be used to so much sun.” “Have a seat take a load off” he tells her. Trina tells Rory that the attendant told her that all of the lounges are taken due to the fact that she arrived there late.

“I didn’t and I snagged you one” Rory tells her thus saving the day. He added that he also got her a day pass at the pool.

Rory goes on to tell her that he is an “optimist.” Trina tells Rory that her good friend Josslyn’s mother co-owns the Metro Court so they would both be there regularly last summer.

This marks Rory’s first time at the pool since he was “much more of a lake guy.” He subsequently gets Trina a non-alcoholic drink. “I think I can get used to this lifestyle” Rory admitted. “Don’t worry about the cost PCPD officers get a discount.”

“Thank you and not just for the drink. Thank you for everything” Trina said graciously. She reminds him that he got her mind off of several difficult things that she has been dealing with lately including Spencer.

She went on to thank him for his company. “Now that I will drink to” he says.

Judging from these scenes it looks like Spencer (Nicholas Alexander Chavez) will have competition on “General Hospital” with Rory over Trina.

Regardless cheers hoping that this will lead to a positive and fruitful relationship for Rory and Trina. Hopefully they can bring much-needed normalcy and serenity to Port Charles.

(AP) — The USS Oregon officially joined the U.S. Navy fleet on Saturday marking the first submarine named after the Beaver State in more than a century.

The newest Virginia-class fast attack submarine which can dive to depths greater than 800 feet (240 meters) was originally christened in 2019. But the COVID-19 pandemic created some “slips in schedule” for the crew said U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney D-Conn. whose district includes General Dynamics Corp.’s Electric Boat Shipyard where the 377-foot (115-meter) submarine was constructed.

“But I think the record should be clear that despite that unprecedented disruption you showed up for work every day and did your job” Courtney told the crew of approximately 136 Navy personnel during Saturday’s ceremony held at the U.S. Submarine Base in Groton.

“Please know that as you embark on your deployments the people of this state in Rhode Island will be 100% behind you and you will always be welcome here” Courtney said.

It marked the Navy’s first in-person commission ceremony since 2019 due to the pandemic. There was however a christening ceremony for the USS Hyman Rickover in August 2021.

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown who said she felt at home with the mist and overcast skies urged the crew members to embrace the traits Oregonian residents possess including a sense of adventure as well as being courageous collaborative and compassionate.

“May this crew remember that at the heart of service is compassion and love: love of this country love of this people love of her values” said Brown a Democrat.

The Oregon is the second Block IV Virginia-class submarine to enter service. The Navy said the sub is designed to conduct anti-submarine warfare anti-surface warfare delivery of special operations forces strike warfare irregular warfare intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and mine warfare.

For instance this includes not only a strategic culture and history but also a relatively common strategic outlook. They have all suffered from a very similar modernisation urgency – to phase out outdated equipment which dates back to the times of the Warsaw Pact. They are all member states both of NATO and the European Union where they cooperate (it is sufficient to mention the EU’s Visegrád Battlegroup).

However despite many initiatives and plans – for instance regarding joint procurement efforts (assault helicopters or AIFVs) – the level of collaboration among the V4 States is relatively low. As noted in a Central European Policy Institute’s report entitled “Towards a Deeper Visegrad Defence Partnership” “while there is general trust among the four countries on the highest political levels the bureaucratic and military establishments are much more suspicious of collaboration (…) The Czechs see defence industrial collaboration with Poland as a potentially valuable way to assimilate new technologies and win a foothold in the (much larger) Polish market. But the Czechs have been frustrated by the Polish government’s protectionist attitude.”

Financial constraints represent another obstacle hampering prospects of deep V4 military cooperation. The militaries of Czechia Slovakia and Hungary which are smaller than the Polish Armed Forces have been affected by past economic crises including the last one a result of the COVID pandemic. Moreover there is no consensus when it comes to strategic vision. Although as mentioned earlier they share the same principles the V4 States differ when it comes to Russia with Poland being the most vulnerable to the Russian threat while Hungary remains essentially a pro-Kremlin state even despite the war in Ukraine.

Both Czechia and Slovakia seem to be somewhat detached from the current tensions.

Nevertheless joint procurements would still offer potential benefits including lower unit costs and savings in maintenance and logistics support. Moreover the V4 would then accomplish a goal declared on numerous occasions by political leaders in Warsaw Prague Bratislava and Budapest – to integrate more closely also in a military dimension which would give them a chance to reduce their dependence on Western Europe (this is one of the goals set by the “Bucharest Nine” – a group founded by Romania and Poland in 2015 which also includes Bulgaria Estonia Latvia Poland Romania and Lithuania). Closer collaboration is coherent with visions promoted by two initiatives namely NATO’s Smart Defence initiative) and the European Union’s Pooling & Sharing concept.

Poland

Although Poland with an annual defence budget of €12.44Bn has the largest military among all V4 members (110000 troops) its Ground Forces (Wojska Lądowe) have still suffered from the absence of a modern tracked AIFV. Nevertheless in recent years Poland has introduced some new equipment (including LEOPARD 2A4/2A5 tanks KTO Rosomak APCs or ŻMIJA long-range light reconnaissance vehicles).

However its mechanised battalions are still equipped with approximately 1000 ageing Soviet-era BMP-1s (locally known as BWP-1 which stands for Bojowy Wóz Piechoty). The first batch of BMP-1s arrived in Poland in 1974 (as a replacement of the Polish-Czechoslovak 8×8 wheeled OT-64 SKOT APCs) and the last one in 1988 (altogether more than 1300 vehicles). Due to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact Poland has never had an opportunity to acquire a newer version – known as the BMP-2 not to mention the BMP-3. Despite several attempts of the Wojska Lądowe in the 1990s Polish BMP-1s have never been upgraded despite the fact that over the years several projects were proposed by Polish industry (including these known as BWP-2000 and PUMA).

BORSUK

Given the fact that Poland has a relatively large industrial base the Ministry of National Defence decided that instead of procuring an off-the-shelf product from a foreign company Wojska Lądowe would acquire the BORSUK (BADGER) AIFV designed and due to be manufactured by the Huta Stalowa Wola (HSW). The whole project codenamed NPBWP Borsuk (Nowy Pływający Bojowy Wóz Piechoty Borsuk – New Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle Borsuk) was launched in 2013 in cooperation with:

OBRUM

Rosomak SA

Wojskowe Zakłady Elektroniczne (WZE)

Wojskowe Zakłądy Inżynieryjne (WZI)

Wojskowe Zakłady Motoryzacyjne (WZM)

Akademia Obrony Narodowej (AON)

Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna (WAT)

Wojskowy Instytut Techniki Pancernej i Samochodowej (WITPiS)

Politechnika Warszawska (PW)

It was initially planned that the vehicle would be ready to order in 2017 but this deadline was not met. Before production is launched the HSW still needs to accomplish another phase namely the qualifying examinations.

The BORSUK AIFVs will serve alongside the ROSOMAK wheeled multi-role armoured vehicles (Patria’s AMV). Both vehicles are expected to be equipped with the ZSSW-30/Zdalnie Sterowany System Wieżowy (Remotely Controlled Turret System) which is jointly produced by WB Electronics and HSW. The main armament of the ZSSW is the ATK Mk44 BUSHMASTER II 30 mm cannon with a co-axial UKM-2000C 7.62 mm gun and two SPIKE-LR ATGMs. Poland has also faced a large setback in this project – with production of the ZSSW-30 delayed by several years. It has not been launched yet but early this year the HSW informed that it was finishing preparations for full-scale production. A total order could be for up to 1400 ZSWW-30s. When deployed it will be Poland’s first advanced remotely controlled turret system. A full introduction of the ZSWW-30s is one of Poland’s modernisation priorities.

Ten mechanised battalions of the Wojska Lądowe are expected to receive up to 588 vehicles in AIFV configuration by 2035. This means that it will be some time before all BWP-1s are retired. In the meantime Polish defence companies are offering interim solutions until a new AIFV is fully introduced. For instance in 2021 the WZM from Poznań presented a modernisation package for the BWP-1. The original 73 mm 2A28 GROM low-pressure smoothbore short-recoil semi-automatic gun was replaced by the Cockerill 1030 remotely-controlled station integrated with the BUSHMASTER Mk44S 30 mm gun and a 7.62 mm machinegun. The same facility also presented a concept of a tank destroyer mounted on the BWP-1’s chassis. WZM hinted that it could be integrated with ATGMs such as the SPIKE which are already in Polish service. It is widely expected that the Ministry of National Defence will sooner or later announce a decision to modernise its BWP-1 fleet. Initial works in this regard were launched in 2020 but no decisions have yet been made.

Slovakia

With a defence budget worth €1.95Bn (2.1 per cent of GDP) and with roughly 18500 Slovakia has an ongoing plan to phase out its BVP-1 (Bojové Vozidlo Pechoty) BVP-2 and BVP-2M vehicles. The Slovak Land Forces (PSSR Pozemné sily Slovenskej republiky) has approximately 177 of these vehicles in five mechanised battalions within the 1st Mechanised Brigade in Topoľčany and the 2nd Mechanised Brigade in Prešov. A replacement of Soviet era vehicles was recommended by the Slovak General Staff and is among the top modernisation initiatives. New AIFVs are also a core element of a deep modernisation strategy which has been pursued by Slovak Defence Minister Jaroslav Naď. Thanks to a technical upgrade Bratislava expects to achieve two goals: to increase national defence capabilities and to meet the country’s commitments to its NATO allies.

Bratislava launched a procurement procedure for tracked AIFVs in late 2021. During the first phase (by 2026) the PSSR is expected to receive 152 – not yet selected – tracked vehicles which are to be acquired via a G2G (Government-to-Government) agreement. The estimated value of the procurement is €1.74Bn out of which €1.45Bn will be devoted to vehicles in several variants:

131 AIFVs (with a turret armed with 30/40 mm automatic cannon and ATGMs most likely from Israel)

15 command vehicles

three mobile workshops

three recovery vehicles

An additional 72 vehicles in various versions are expected to be acquired between 2027-2030. A key intent of this procurement is underlined by the fact that these vehicles are expected to become a core element of a new heavy mechanised brigade the construction of which is one of the basic commitments of Slovakia to NATO. This elite formation will be based upon the current 1st Mechanised Brigade and will have three battalions of mechanised infantry one tank battalion one self-propelled howitzers battalion one ISTAR battalion and several auxiliary units.

Bratislava’s requirements include transparency the involvement of local industry as well as the best value for money. Initially 33 potential suppliers submitted their proposals with just four shortlisted. One of them is Poland’s BORSUK which was officially offered to Slovakia by the Polish Ministry of Defence on behalf of the PGZ (Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa). This is the first time the BORSUK was directly offered to a foreign customer. Other contenders are:

the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) jointly with BAE Systems Hägglunds (CV90 in the latest Mk IV variant)

General Dynamics European Land Systems (ASCOD 2)

Rheinmetall AG (KF41 LYNX which would be co-manufactured in Hungarian facilities in Zalaegerszeg).

In order to select the best product Slovakia asked for dynamic and static demonstrations of all submitted vehicles. The first such event was held in March 2021 at VTSU (Vojenský technický a skúšobný ústav) in Záhorie with a demonstration of the LYNX vehicle. In April 2021 similar trials were carried out with the ASCOD 2 while the CV90 was tested in June. It seems that the German offer has the highest chances of winning – Rheinmetall promised to exceed the 40 per cent requirement for direct content. The German company which has already been cooperating with Slovak industry has released its plans for a new factory in Moldava nad Bodvou (eastern Slovakia). The facility would be responsible for delivering the chassis and turrets for the LYNX AIFV as well as handling systems integration testing and paintwork. It would also provide maintenance for the Slovak AIFV fleet.

Tank Plans

In parallel to the acquisition of tracked AIFVs Slovakia is looking for new tanks for its 2nd Mechanised Brigade (currently it is armed with a battalion of 22 T-72M1s located in Trebišov). Most likely Bratislava will receive 32 tanks and 17 tracked bridge-layers based on the same chassis. It is worth adding that Slovakia initially decided not to procure 81 wheeled (8×8) vehicles known as the VYDRA. This has also been a top priority for the Slovak military which does not have any wheeled fighting vehicle/APC suitable for modern warfare. Initially Patria’s AMV-XP with the EVPÚ Defence’s TURRA 30 remote-controlled weapon station was selected but Bratislava was not satisfied with the cost and insufficient level of ballistic protection. Plans had to be changed.

The whole tender for new wheeled BOV (Bojové Obrnené Vozidlo) 8×8 AIFVs was then re-launched. Slovakia confirmed its plan to acquire 76 vehicles during the first phase (2023-2025 in three variants) for €332M and 500 in total (in 20 variants including a combat variant with a 30 mm main gun and ATGMs). Five proposals were submitted:

PANDUR II (Czech Tatra)

PIRANHA-V (Romanian Uzina Mecanica Bucuresti in cooperation with General Dynamics European Land Systems and Mowag)

DRAGON VCR (Spanish General Dynamics European Land Systems-Santa Bárbara Sistemas)

LAV-III (US General Dynamics)

AMV 8×8 (Finnish Patria)

Finally in March 2022 Slovakia… once again selected Patria’s offer.

Hungary

Apart from Poland Hungary – with a defence budget worth €2.9 billion (1.7 per cent of GDP) – has the most mature AIFV programme. A modernisation of the Hungarian Defence Forces (MH Magyar Honvédség) which has roughly 22700 troops became a priority for Victor Orban Prime Minister since 2010. A critical milestone was reached in January 2017 when Budapest launched the “Zrínyi 2026” programme. This is the most comprehensive revitalisation initiative in the history of the Hungarian military. It also covers the Hungarian Ground Forces (MSH Magyar Szárazföldi Haderő). Budapest’s ambition is not only to procure “off-the-shelf” military systems but also technologies to boost the indigenous defence industry.

Hungary has already ordered a new AIFV. The MSH which is now being equipped with 44 LEOPARD 2A7+ MBTs and an additional 12 tanks in 2A4 variant for training purposes will receive 218 LYNX KF41 tracked AIFVs with the LANCE 30 mm turrets. This procurement is crucial to phase out the old wheeled BTR-80 and BTR-80A APCs. KF41s were ordered in 2020 from Rheinmetall for €2Bn and will be integrated with Rheinmetall’s STRIKE SHIELD hard-kill active protection system (APS) and will replace the ex-Soviet BTR-80 and BTR-80A APCs. The first batch of 46 LYNXs as well as nine BÜFFEL armoured recovery vehicles will be manufactured in Germany and delivered to Hungary by 2023 while the rest (172 vehicles) are to be produced locally in Zalaegerszeg. The foundation stone of a plant worth €169M was laid in 2020 which will become operational in 2023.

A plan to build national industrial capabilities will be boosted not only by the procurement of the LYNX vehicles but also thanks to cooperation with Turkey. The GIDRÁN 4×4 armoured tactical vehicles – based on the EJDER YALÇIN vehicles produced by Nurol Makina – will be integrated with the Aselsan SARP remote weapon station. They were selected in 2020 and the first batch of ten vehicles was handed over by Nurol Makina to the 25th “György Klapka” Infantry Brigade’s military police in Tata in February 2021. In total Hungary is looking to acquire at least 300 vehicles with production of at least 100 expected to be carried out locally in Kaposvár. The facility will also be responsible for some additional works such as equipping the Hungarian GIDRÁNs with radio and other electronic devices.

Czech Republic

The Czech Republic plans to spend 2 per cent of its GDP on defence by 2025 (currently it is approximately 1.4 per cent). The Armáda České Republiky (AČR) which has 27000 troops has continued to use equipment mainly dating back to the times of the Warsaw Pact. Prague already has a modernised fleet of wheeled vehicles – the PANDUR II 8×8 KBVPs (Kolového Bojového Vozidla Pěchoty) has replaced Soviet-era OT-64 SKOTs. However when it comes to tracked AIFVs Prague has not been very successful. The AČR still has the BVP-2s which belong to the 7th Mechanised Brigade in Hranice (BVP-1s are still in the arsenal but only as mobilisation stock in the warehouses in Rančířov – some of which were donated to Ukraine in April this year). This unit with two mechanised battalions one tank battalion (with T-72M4CZs) and one light motorised battalion is the strongest formation of the AČR. The 7th Mechanised Brigade has experience in international operations (under the NATO aegis in Latvia Afghanistan and recently within the EU in Mali) and is expected to become fully compatible with NATO standards by 2026. New AIFVs are crucial for achieving this strategic goal.

The problems now affecting the AČR were unforeseen as 210 new vehicles were promised as a replacement for the BVP-2s. The need to procure a new generation of AIFVs was first mentioned back in 2012 and a contract value the largest ever in the history of the Czech military was estimated at roughly €2.4Bn. As in the case of Slovakia Czechia also required that at least 40 per cent of the programme needs to be carried out by local companies. In late 2017 Prague completed field trials of four AIFVs:

ASCOD (General Dynamics European Land Systems)

CV90 (BAE Systems)

LYNX (Rheinmetall)

PUMA (Rheinmetall Defense and KMW)

The winner was expected to be announced by mid-2018 however the decision was delayed. In late 2018 three vehicles were shortlisted (CV90 ASCOD and LYNX) while in late 2021 the Czech Ministry of Defense halted the process and announced that none of three contenders met the tender’s requirements. The decision was a great disappointment for the Czech military establishment and negatively affected the national plan to boost defence capabilities. In March 2022Defence Minister Jana Černochová admitted openly that a delayed tender was a crucial element both for boosting the Czech military and for Prague’s contribution to NATO.

Future Projects

Despite some orally expressed hopes of various experts and commentators the close industrial cooperation among the V4 States and joint procurement efforts of armoured vehicles remain unlikely. Each member has chosen its own development path which does not assume cooperation with the others.

When it comes to the most preferred industrial partner Germany seems to be a leader and there doesn’t seem to be anything to indicate any change in this regard. Hungary has already ordered German AIFVs while both the Czech Republic and Slovakia were also offered vehicles from Germany. Berlin is seen not only as an attractive political partner but also as a valuable industrial provider of modern technologies willing to invest in local economies which is also one of top priorities of V4 States.

New details have been added to this version.

COVINGTON Ga. — Covington police were investigating today after a reported shooting that left one dead at the General Mills plant in northeast Covington.

A suspect was in custody and being interviewed by police following the 11:40 a.m. incident at the cereal production plant at 15200 Industrial Park Blvd NE a CPD spokesman said.

Officers were investigating the possibility the shooting occurred after one employee was confronted about some ""odd behavior"" he was exhibiting after which the suspect shot and killed someone the spokesman said.

Company officials evacuated the plant as a safety precaution said CPD Capt. Brent Fuesting.

""There was never any other danger to any other employee"" he said.

The victim will not be identified until next of kin are notified he said. More information was not immediately available.

General Mills spokesperson Mollie Wulff said in a statement ""Our Covington Ga. facility reported a shooting incident this morning.

""Law enforcement apprehended the individual. We are working with local law enforcement"" Wulff said.

It was the second incident on the grounds of the plant in two months.

This eye-catching concept was created by GM exterior designer Zac Parkinson and is a very futuristic twist on the Denali nameplate. It is so futuristic that it shares essentially nothing in common with current Denali-badged pickups and SUVs from GMC. That’s no bad thing however.

Immediately making the front end of the truck stand out is a bold faux grille with an intricate pattern. Wrapping around either side of the grille are sharp LED headlights. The front of the Denali also has a large GMC badge and a striking bumper.

First Drive: 2022 GMC Sierra Denali Ultimate Is The New King Of Luxury Mountain

Elsewhere Parkinson has designed the crossover with squared-off front wheel arches and a shapely hood with dramatic creases and curves. Given that this is a concept and doesn’t need to be practical there is a very low-slung roof with a narrow windshield and rear-facing cameras in the place of traditional wing mirrors. While the Denali pictured hasn’t been rendered with doors it would probably look best as a two-door crossover-coupe.

Of course it is very unlikely there will ever be a Denali model that even faintly resembles this but if such a vehicle did become a reality you certainly wouldn’t hear any complaints from us.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlvdHdvcmxkdG9kYXkuY29tL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLWxvZ2lzdGljcy9nbS1zLWNydWlzZS1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLWNhci1ibG9ja3MtZmlyZS10cnVjay1vbi1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktY2FsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM’s Cruise Autonomous Car Blocks Fire Truck on Emergency Call,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlvdHdvcmxkdG9kYXkuY29tL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLWxvZ2lzdGljcy9nbS1zLWNydWlzZS1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLWNhci1ibG9ja3MtZmlyZS10cnVjay1vbi1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktY2FsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533F5B3340>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlvdHdvcmxkdG9kYXkuY29tL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLWxvZ2lzdGljcy9nbS1zLWNydWlzZS1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLWNhci1ibG9ja3MtZmlyZS10cnVjay1vbi1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktY2FsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmNvbXBsYWludHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9nbWMteXVrb24tdGFpbC1saWdodC1jbGFzcy1hY3Rpb24tbGF3c3VpdC1idXJucy1vdXQuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GMC Yukon Tail Light Class Action Lawsuit Burns Out | CarComplaints.com,"GMC Yukon owner allegedly paid more than $670 to replace the passenger-side tail light.

May 29 2022 — A GMC Yukon tail light failure class action lawsuit has been dismissed after a Florida Yukon owner filed the lawsuit because she paid about $671 for a replacement tail light assembly.

According to the lawsuit 2017-2019 GMC Yukon GMC Yukon XL GMC Yukon Denali and GMC Yukon Denali XL SUVs are equipped with tail lights that allegedly should have been recalled years ago.

Florida plaintiff Rhonda Small says she purchased a 2017 GMC Yukon XL in February 2017 and about four years later the passenger-side Yukon tail light failed and was replaced for $671.85.

General Motors allegedly knows the Yukon tail lights fail from defects yet the automaker forces owners to pay for replacements.

The plaintiff argues GM has issued bulletins and special programs about Yukon tail lights but never issued an official recall.

According to the Yukon class action lawsuit special coverage adjustment (SCA) program N182180270 announced in November 2019 is a good example. Entitled “Tail Lamps Inoperative” it applied to Yukons but was limited to 2015-2016 Yukons only.

The program required GM dealers to replace failed Yukon tail lights for free and Yukon owners and lessees who paid for repairs were reimbursed. Replacement coverage was for six years or 72000 miles.

The class action lawsuit alleges the Yukon tail light problem is caused by condensation inside the assembly which creates a fog inside the surface of the tail light lens.

GMC Yukon Tail Light Class Action Lawsuit Dismissed

General Motors filed a motion to dismiss the Yukon class action by arguing several points mainly by asserting the plaintiff didn't personally own any of the GMC Yukons named in the tail light lawsuit. According to GM there is no way the plaintiff suffered an ""injury"" from a failed tail light on a Yukon registered in a corporate name.

GM also attacked the lawsuit allegation regarding the special program for Yukon tail lights that allegedly didn't include model year 2017 Yukons.

GM told the judge the special coverage adjustment for tail lights was revised and extended to 2017 GMC Yukon Yukon XL Yukon Denali and Yukon Denali XL vehicles.

And GM says the business which owns the GMC Yukon named as the plaintiff's vehicle received notification of warranty extension in June 2020.

According to court documents all warranty claims against GM should be dismissed because the plaintiff never had a relationship with General Motors concerning the GMC Yukon.

GM further argues the alleged Yukon tail light failure occurred almost a year after the warranty expired.

Multiple other GM arguments were against the plaintiff including a claim related to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act which requires at least 100 named plaintiffs not provided by the class action lawsuit.

The automaker also told the judge the class action lawsuit wasn't filed within the four-year statute of limitations and the plaintiff allegedly never mentions any misleading statements made by General Motors.

The judge earlier dismissed certain claims against GM but has now dismissed the tail light class action by agreeing with GM regarding warranty claims over the Yukons.

The plaintiff didn't have a connection to General Motors and this was enough to convince the judge to toss the warranty claims. Additionally the final blow came when the judge ruled there was nothing misleading or deceptive about GM's conduct.

The GMC Yukon tail light class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida: Rhonda Small v. General Motors LLC.

The plaintiff is represented by Freidin Brown P.A. Pomerantz LLP and Justice Law.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNndWlkZS5jb20uYXUvY2FyLW5ld3MvZGlkLWdlbmVyYWwtbW90b3JzLW1ha2UtdGhlLXJpZ2h0LWRlY2lzaW9uLXRvLWF4ZS1ob2xkZW4td2h5LXRoZS0yMDIyLWNoZXZyb2xldC1saW5lLXVw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did General Motors make the right decision to axe Holden? Why the 2022 Chevrolet line-up would have been a threat ...,"The demise of Holden was a sad chapter in the Australian automotive industry with what was once considered unthinkable eventually becoming inevitable.

Or was it?

Did General Motors make the right decision to close down Holden and effectively give up on the mainstream automotive market in Australia? Should GM have instead considered an alternative plan remaining a key player in the local market but instead replacing Holden with the Chevrolet brand?

During what turned out to be the final years of Holden there was often speculation that the Chevrolet brand would replace the Lion badge. It turned out to be true to a certain degree with General Motors Speciality Vehicles (GMSV) effectively taking the place of Holden Down Under.

While GMSV has so far proven a promising niche offering for the American giant a closer examination of the 2023 Chevrolet line-up shows a range of vehicles that would seemingly have given GM a strong chance of remaining a top five brand in the country.

One of the supposed strengths of Holden during its final years was its ability to draw from across the GM brands but you could also argue the opposite. The final Holden line-up ended up with a hodgepodge of models from Chevrolet GMC Buick and Opel all with the Lion badge stuck on.

A wholesale switch to an all-Chevy line-up could have given GM a fresh start whilst still leveraging the legacy of Holden with its extensive dealer network and the obvious connection between the two brands.

Don’t believe me? Here’s a rundown of how the 2022 Chevrolet line-up could have looked if GM had chosen a different path.

Chevrolet Trailblazer - replacing Holden Trax

Yes it would have been a little confusing switching Holden’s largest SUV nameplate to its smallest SUV but the compact Chevy is a stylish offering that comes with both sporty RS and rugged ACTIV variants.

Both are powered by a 155kW 1.3-litre turbocharged petrol engine and there’s a less powerful 1.2-litre engine for the cheaper models in the range.

While the Trax was a solid offering the better-looking Trailblazer would have stood a better chance against the popular Mazda CX-3 Hyundai Kona and Toyota C-HR.

Chevrolet Blazer - replacing Holden Equinox

The Equinox is a good example of the wrong car at the right time. Holden desperately needed a good mid-size SUV to replace the unloved Captiva and sadly the Equinox was not it.

A disappointing driving experience as well as a conservative exterior and interior design meant the Equinox struggled against the likes of the Toyota RAV4 Hyundai Tucson and Mazda CX-5.

The Chevy Blazer is a more stylish and sportier version of the Equinox and if Australians love two things it’s SUVs and sporty models.

One major difference between the two Chevys is that the Blazer is available with a 230kW 3.6-litre V6 engine in the range-topping RS model which would have been a point-of-difference in the market.

Even more than that Chevrolet has confirmed the Blazer EV is coming by 2024 and will likely extend the already sporty line-up with a rival to the Ford Mustang Mach-E GT and Kia EV6 GT. An electric mid-size SUV is likely to become a ‘must-have’ for any serious car company by the middle of this decade so Chevrolet would have been ideally placed to compete in the Australian market.

Chevrolet Tahoe - replacing Holden Acadia

The Acadia was the best example of GM’s lackadaisical attitude to Holden because instead of working to get the Chevrolet Traverse that was the seven-seat sibling to the Equinox we got this GMC version. It was a completely different model from a different brand with a different design language; it would be a bit like Hyundai sticking its badge on the Kia Stinger and trying to sell it in Hyundai showrooms.

Instead the ideal seven-seat option for Australia was arguably the Tahoe - Chevy’s big boxy SUV that would have been unlike anything else on sale locally.

It’s based on the same basic underpinnings as the Chevy Silverado 1500 and it’s an open-secret that HSV was trying to build a business case to convert it locally before the GMSV deal took over.

The choice of a 313kW 6.2-litre V8 or 200kW 3.0-litre turbo diesel would have given Chevrolet a genuine rival to the likes of the Toyota Kluger and Prado as well as the likes of the Hyundai Palisade Kia Sorento and Mazda CX-9.

Chevrolet Suburban - replacing Holden Trailblazer

Naturally if Chevrolet brought the Tahoe it would only make sense to offer the extended Suburban. Holden tried it back in the late 1990s and it was seen as too big then but these days it seems Australians love their SUVs bigger the better.

While it wouldn’t have been as off-road capable as the Colorado-based Trailblazer the Suburban would undoubtedly steal sales from the likes of not only the Toyota LandCruiser and Nissan Patrol but also potentially the Range Rover BMW X7 and Mercedes-Benz GLS.

Chevrolet Colorado and Silverado 1500 - replacing Holden Colorado

The biggest loss from the Holden line-up would have been the Colorado as it was the brand’s biggest seller by a significant margin. In fact GM’s decision to sell the Thai factory where the Colorado was built was perhaps the final nail in the coffin for Holden.

However Chevrolet has its own US-version of the Colorado that would have not only been able to step in and replace the Aussie-version of the ute but also been something different. The US version is slightly larger and comes with its own Raptor-rival the ZR2 with a 230kW V6 petrol engine and state-of-the-art off-road dampers.

Plus Chevrolet would have also had the Silverado 1500 (as well as the bigger 2500 and 3500) to extend its ute line-up. So even if they would have been more expensive than the Holden Colorado Chevrolet’s current success with the Silverado suggests the US models would have been a fitting replacement.

Plus there’s also the Silverado EV looming in 2024 which has the potential to be a game-changer for the brand.

Chevrolet Corvette - replacing Holden Commodore

At first glance the idea of replacing the Commodore with the Corvette seems ridiculous. But it’s less ridiculous than trying to replace it with another passenger car especially when the only option is the forgettable Malibu (a badge with a very negative Australian reputation).

The Corvette C8 is arguably the car with the closest appeal to Holden’s once-beloved locally-made Commodore range. The V8-powered SS and SS-V models - plus the HSV variants - were the heart and soul of the brand and the Corvette would represent that same spirit for Chevrolet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYm9ybmVvYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tLmJuL25ldy1pbmRlcGVuZGVudC1tZXhpY2FuLXVuaW9uLXdpbnMtd2FnZS1pbmNyZWFzZS1hdC1nbS1wbGFudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New independent Mexican union wins wage increase at GM plant,"MEXICO CITY (AP) – A new independent union at a Mexican auto plant that won a historic organising vote last year has negotiated an 8.5-per-cent wage increase for unionised employees.

Authorities said on Friday that workers at the General Motors (GM) transmission and pickup plants in the northern Mexico city of Silao voted overwhelmingly to approve the new contract which also increases benefits by 2.5 per cent.

The federal labour board said that in voting on Wednesday and Thursday 87 per cent of the plant’s 6331 unionised employees voted in favour of the new contract.

Plant employees had not previously been able to vote openly by secret ballot on contracts or who would represent them. The Independent Union of Auto Industry Workers known by its initials in Spanish as Sinttia won an organising vote in February after ousting an old guard union last year.

The Sinttia union said the contract actually increases benefits by 5.3 per cent. Mexico’s inflation rate was running at nearly 7.7 per cent in April meaning the wage and benefit package combined was above inflation.

The new contract “represents a significant improvement over the labour conditions we had and an improvement in wages and benefits” the union said in a statement."

If your Apple device is in need of a service you may be doing more harm than good by getting it done cheaply.

Apple released a statement yesterday telling users to steer clear of ""nongenuine"" battery services or replacements.

While it's typically more pricey to get your device officially serviced they advise that it could reduce possible complications as well as safety risks in the future.

The statement warns that a shoddy replacement could lead to: ""overheating fire or injury"".

It could also lead to a whole host of performance issues including: ""unexpected behaviour after installation device software updates or while charging""

They do say that you don't necessarily have to go to Apple for a service as some Independent Repair Providers have access to Apple genuine parts tools training service guides and diagnostics.

This however could leave your phone out of warranty says the statement.

If you have a second-hand iPhone that you were told was in warranty you can check yourself by going to Settings then General and then About where you will find the parts and service history of your device.

If your phone says ""Genuine Apple Part"" it is real if it does not instead saying ""Unknown Part"" there is a good chance that your device is not covered by the manufacturer warranty.

Why is using 'genuine' Apple batteries so important?

iPhones use Lithium-ion batteries which can be sensitive and flammable if mishandled they could pose a fire risk to your device.

The statement says: ""Repairs performed by untrained individuals using nongenuine parts might affect the safety of the device or might cause improper function.""

From putting in the wrong battery to damaging your battery when servicing it an uncertified engineer could make the device that you keep in your pocket a serious risk.

They also say: ""Genuine batteries are designed to work with iOS to function properly including to report charge levels and battery health.""

Apple has in the past admitted to deliberately slowing down the performance of batteries of older models of iPhone to encourage users to pick up a new model.",,,,,,,,,

His comment was part of a panel discussion held on Tuesday at the Global Blockchain Business Council’s (GBBC) Blockchain Central Davos Conference in Switzerland.To conclude the panel discussion the moderator asked each panellist whether SWIFT would still be around after five years. The panel included Jennifer Lassiter executive director of the Digital Dollar Project David Treat a director at Accenture and co-founder of the Digital Dollar Project Jon Frost senior economist at the Bank of International Settlements and Yuval Rooz the CEO of Digital Asset.Considering its stature and importance in the global payments network every other panel member responded positively barring Miebach who responded ‘no’. His answer astounded the group of executives attending the blockchain conference which is running parallel to the World Economic Forum.SWIFT stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is a financial payments protocol that facilitates cross-border payments. It is worth noting that SWIFT is not completely a payments facilitator but a messaging system which transfers payment instructions.It does not actually send money from one bank to another. It simply notifies one bank to credit/debit another bank account through encrypted messages.Let’s say you want to send money to a friend in the US. While filling out the money transfer request you would have to enter the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) of your friend’s bank his account number the amount you want to transfer etc. Once you hit send the money is debited from your account.Now what SWIFT does is it simply encrypts the details of your payment and sends it over to the recipient’s bank. Now your friend’s bank is notified of an incoming payment request so it credits your friend’s account. Of course this only happens after the funds bounce around from one bank to another until they reach your friend’s bank account. And then voila the money has been transferred.According to the official website SWIFT harnesses a network of 11000 financial institutions spread across two hundred countries to process over forty-six million transactions daily. It is widely used by central banks corporates financial institutions and custodians to make payments and settle trades. This is precisely why Miebach’s answer came as a surprise to those attending the panel discussion.However soon after the comment Mastercard released a statement via e-mail which read “Let us clarify the intent of the on-stage comment as it’s not as simple as a yes or no answer. Michael was simply reinforcing what SWIFT has previously said — their operations continue to evolve. Its current form will not be the same in the future. They are adding more functionality and moving past just being a messaging system.”SWIFT plans to leverage the capabilities of CBDC s to improve upon its offerings. CBDCs are gaining traction as cryptocurrencies have been at the receiving end of several central banks and governments. Many nations consider cryptocurrencies unfavourable due to their decentralised nature and the potential malfeasance that may follow. Hence countries and central banks view CBDCs as the next best alternative.One may argue that CBDCs shall be designed to simplify the role of a sovereign currency within a nation’s borders. It is also possible that all CBDCs may not be built upon the same technology. In such a case how will SWIFT unify multiple CBDCs? Several questions have been raised since the digital form of fiat currencies became the talk of the town.Well SWIFT has been tinkering with CBDCs since 2021. The messaging platform believes that linking various CBDCs is the key to unlocking their true potential and it could significantly simplify cross-border payments.In their experiments they were successfully able to execute a cross-border transaction between a CBDC network and the traditionally used RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement) system. On 19th May 2022 SWIFT announced on Twitter its collaboration with French IT firm Capgemini to build interlinking systems that would enable such payment combinations. According to its official blog post three use cases are being worked on - “CBDC to CBDC CBDC to fiat and fiat to CBDC. ““Navigating decentralisation is complex with many technology choices operating models and policy considerations. Our well-defined taxonomy has helped us accelerate our efforts to build CBDC interlinks with SWIFT” wrote Sudhir Pai Chief Technology & Innovation Officer Financial Services at Capgemini. “We look forward to continue to collaborate in building industry standards and frameworks with SWIFT” he added.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy9pbi1pbmRpYS1zLW1vYmlsZS1wYXltZW50cy1ib29tLWV2ZW4tYmVnZ2Fycy1nZXQtcXItY29kZXMtMTE2NTM4Mjk2NjczNDQuaHRtbNIBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy9pbi1pbmRpYS1zLW1vYmlsZS1wYXltZW50cy1ib29tLWV2ZW4tYmVnZ2Fycy1nZXQtcXItY29kZXMvYW1wLTExNjUzODI5NjY3MzQ0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In India’s mobile-payments boom even beggars get QR codes | Mint,"BETTIAH (INDIA) : A beggar in the eastern Indian state of Bihar strolled through a train station one recent weekday toting a metal pail for cash and a tablet computer with a QR code stuck on the back.

Raju Prasad began accepting donations via mobile-payment apps a few months ago. The 42-year-old said his takings have almost doubled to about 300 rupees a day—that is roughly $4 and more than the average daily wage for a farm laborer in Bihar India’s poorest state. Many travelers now zap over 5 or 10 rupees with a few taps on their smartphones instead of digging out their wallets.

“People used to shoo me away saying they didn’t have cash"" said Mr. Prasad who makes much of his money from passengers arriving at Bettiah station from big cities like New Delhi and Mumbai. “Now they scan my QR codes and happily give whatever small amount they want.""

The fact beggars and their donors are all part of India’s digital finance revolution helps explain the explosive growth in mobile payments—along with the challenge companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google LLC Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart and local rival Paytm face in making the business profitable.

Indians have been migrating toward digital financial services for some time. That is in part due to rising wealth better internet and more-affordable technology—and because Prime Minister Narendra Modi put digital transformation at the center of government policy.

Launched in 2015 “Digital India"" aims for faster and more inclusive economic growth by pushing government and banking services online and by bringing the country’s masses of poor especially in rural areas into the formal economy through investment in technology.

But it was the pandemic that turbocharged the shift. Lockdowns forced millions of people to buy groceries and medicine through mobile apps because they couldn’t leave their homes. ATMs ran out of cash—which in any case many people shunned over fears they would catch the virus by handling physical money.

By the second quarter of 2020 mobile payments had eclipsed ATM withdrawals to account for 30% of Indian private consumption according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Mobile payments more than doubled to almost $1 trillion in 2021 from the year before.

“The only silver lining of the pandemic is that everyone started using digital payments a lot more"" said Karthik Raghupathy head of strategy and investor relations for PhonePe Flipkart’s payment unit. As Covid-19 reached India PhonePe’s registered users jumped 50% he said.

Bangalore-based PhonePe now has around 165 million monthly active users and 48% of India’s mobile payments by value says S&P Global. Google’s share is 40% and Paytm’s is almost 9%.

India’s 48.6 billion digital payments last year were more than double those in next-ranked China according to an April report by payment-systems company ACI Worldwide which said volumes could top 200 billion by 2026. But with the average Indian user making $80 of payments a year compared with $2300 in China and almost $8000 in the U.S. as well as a government cap on transaction fees India’s allure is more the potential to secure a slice of its market of nearly 1.4 billion people than near-term profit.

For now digital-payment providers in India are likely losing money—and lots of it analysts say.

That is partly due to the way India’s payments system evolved.

Countries like China and the U.S.—the two biggest digital-payments markets by value—relied on private companies to develop the technological backbone to support phone transactions. In India that task was given to the National Payments Corporation of India a nonprofit organization that governs the country’s retail payments. It had a mandate to “facilitate an affordable payment mechanism to benefit the common man across the country and promote financial inclusion.""

The Indian government views digital-payment systems as a public good similar to the power grid said Dilip Asbe NPCI’s managing director and chief executive.

“The efficiency in the payment system is core to the economy"" he said as it improves transparency tax collection and the circulation of money in the formal economy.

NPCI launched its Unified Payments Interface in 2016. Companies were then invited to develop apps on top of the platform better known as UPI.

India also had three ingredients UPI needed to succeed Mr. Asbe said: ID cards bank accounts and smartphones. Mr. Modi’s government has pushed people to get biometric ID cards and for every household to have at least one bank account.

About 80% of adults had bank accounts by 2017 from 35% six years earlier the most recently published central-bank data show. The number of smartphone users meanwhile has risen to 750 million Deloitte said in a February report.

UPI’s platform is also interoperable. Transactions are made by scanning a QR code linked to a person or business or by looking up someone’s phone number or virtual address. All the QR codes work on any of the apps hosted by UPI. That is a contrast to the U.S. where someone shopping at Walmart for example can’t scan the checkout QR code using PayPal’s Venmo app.

Fueled by the pandemic UPI’s users soared 85% to 250 million in the two years to March with more than 300 banks and two dozen payment apps now on the platform.

The interoperability that helped power adoption of mobile payments however also makes it easy to switch between apps forcing companies to give cash rebates and other incentives to keep customers. They have also spent heavily on marketing and educating merchants and consumers on how mobile payments work.

“It’s a chicken and egg problem"" said Madhur Deora Paytm’s chief financial officer: If not enough merchants sign up customers will have little reason to do so.

Almost 90% of India’s nearly $900-billion-a-year retail market is controlled by small family-owned shops that rarely accept credit cards because of the 3% to 4% charges they levy. A 2020 government ban on transaction fees for UPI-based payments enticed many smaller merchants to sign up—along with their customers.

The ban is also one of the biggest hurdles to profitability for the payments companies. In January a group of them urged the government to scrap the rule which they estimated had caused an industrywide loss of more than $700 million.

Analysts said it would take at least a few years before any mobile-payment company turns a profit in India. Meanwhile local startups are competing against giants like Google and Walmart that can afford to burn through cash as they build market share.

In the long run digital-payment companies are looking to sell financial services and other products said Sampath Sharma Nariyanuri an S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst.

PhonePe is advertising insurance products on television. Google Pay recently let merchants open digital storefronts within its app. Paytm meanwhile plans to seek regulatory approval to sell insurance.

In Bakharia village in Bihar state with a population of about 1500 almost all the two dozen or so stores and stalls straddling the main road display placards or stickers with QR codes.

Ranjan Patel who operates a small shop selling betel nuts said he signed up for multiple apps after customers began demanding to pay with their smartphones. Now almost 80% of them do.

“They like to flaunt their smartphones and scan QR codes to pay"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjM1ODkyNS9ydXNzaWEtd2hlYXQtdG8tYmUtaW1wb3J0ZWQtYWdhaW5zdC1jYXNo0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly90cmlidW5lLmNvbS5way9zdG9yeS8yMzU4OTI1L3J1c3NpYS13aGVhdC10by1iZS1pbXBvcnRlZC1hZ2FpbnN0LWNhc2g_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia wheat to be imported against cash,"Pakistan on Saturday decided to directly import two million metric tonnes of wheat from Russian on cash while dropping a barter trade plan as it also approved Rs160 billion supplementary grants to ensure uninterrupted supply of food fuel and electricity.

The decisions were taken by the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet that approved Rs62.3 billion more for payments of fuel subsidies Rs50 billion to reduce power outages and over Rs36 billion for giving targeted subsidies to the poorest families and paying for the subsidised essential commodities at the Utility Stores.

The ECC also temporarily waived off additional customs duties on import of edible oil to incentivise the suppliers to fast track the shipments in June. Finance Minister Miftah Ismail presided over the ECC meeting.

“The ECC allowed import of two million metric tonnes of wheat on a government-to-government basis'' from Russia stated the finance ministry. The Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) will be the recipient agency for the imported wheat from Russia as per the existing arrangement.

The Ministry of National Food Security had proposed that the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Commerce should jointly explore the possibility of barter trade with Russia due to sanctions imposed by the West.

However there are no sanctions on the import of grains from Russia but the government would have to work out a mechanism to make the payments after Moscow has been thrown out of the global payments clearing system –the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift).

This month the federal cabinet had allowed import of three million metric tonnes of wheat including one million metric tonnes through international open tenders.

The wheat output decreased by one million metric tonnes to 26.4 million metric tonnes this year but the consumption is estimated at 30.4 million tonnes. Pakistan faces four million metric tonnes of wheat shortage as global prices soar due to the Russia-Ukraine war.

Accordingly the first international tender for import of 500000 metric tonnes of wheat was issued on May 16 for shipments in June-July 2022. As per bid evaluation committee report the lowest responsive bid came from M/s Falconbridge Resources at the rate of $515.49 per metric tonne.

As per the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS)the per 40kg cost of domestically available wheat is Rs2511 or Rs63 per kilo – whereas the estimated landed cost at port of imported wheat offered comes to Rs4618 per 40kg or Rs115 per kilo which is Rs2106.88 per 40kg higher than the domestically available wheat.

The ECC also approved Rs7.3 billion bridge financing for supply of wheat flour at Rs40 per kilo in Punjab. The Punjab government cannot approve any subsidy amount at this time in absence of a provincial cabinet. The ECC decided that in case subsidy is not approved by the Punjab cabinet the shortfall will be bridged by the federal government but the Punjab government will ensure that the provincial cabinet approves the package as soon as its meeting is convened.

The ECC approved Rs62.3 billion for making payment of price differential claims to oil marketing companies and refineries for the second fortnight of May 2022 to pay for the fuel subsidies. This has brought the total subsidies to Rs211 billion for three months – far higher than Rs110 billion initially estimated by the last PTI government for a four-month period.

The subsidies’ amount would reduce next month due to the government’s decision to increase the prices by 25% from May 26. The ECC also approved Rs24 billion supplementary budget to pay for the cost of Rs28.6 billion PM’s targeted subsidy package for the poor to offset the impact of increase in fuel prices.

The ECC approved Rs50 billion subsidy to clear the dues of the power sector aimed at reducing the unannounced power outages period. At present there is load-shedding of around eight to 10 hours a day due to the government’s inability to run the power plants owing to resource constraints.

The ECC also approved a summary submitted by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission for grant of extension in the construction period of K-2 from November 20 2020 to May 21 2021 and K-3 from September 30 2021 to April 18 2022 for ensuring disbursement of pending loan of $383 million before expiry of loan availability on June 3 2022 from Exim Bank China to the contractor who has already completed the project.

The Ministry of Industries and Production submitted a summary on the continuation of the PM relief package – 2020 for the months of May and June 2022 through the Utility Stores Corporation. The ECC after deliberation allowed continuation of existing subsidy for two weeks on essential commodities (atta sugar rice and pulses) and Rs100 per kilo subsidy on ghee at the USC. The Finance Division will also release the outstanding amount of Rs11 billion on account of subsidy under the PM relief package – 2020 approved by the ECC for the previous months. It also allowed additional subsidies for a two-week period.

The ECC allowed import of 200000 metric tonnes of granular urea from China on government-to-government basis on deferred payment basis within 90 days. The country will pay 4.35% interest rate on the $120 million amount as it does not have money for import.

The ECC did not exempt Rs2.5 billion tax on about $600 million being executed by the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD). In Pakistan the SFD is providing assistance for various projects including energy health education and infrastructure projects.

The ECC considering the comments of the Federal Board of Revenue on the subject suggested that a tax-exemption clause for the SFD may be inserted in the money bill considering strong and strategic relationship between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia encompassing economic cooperation and investment.

Saudi Arabia has conditioned the $845 million loan payments’ suspension with tax waivers.

The Ministry of Commerce submitted a summary on duty structure on import of edible palm oil.

The ECC allowed removing 2% additional customs duties on import of palm oil for shipments originating from all sources except Indonesia for June10-20 2022 subject to approval of the federal cabinet.

ARLINGTON TX – One win away from a championship.

After knocking off Texas Tech on Thursday to move to the Big 12 tournament semifinals Oklahoma looked to punch their ticket to the title game on Saturday against Kansas State.

The No. 3-seeded Sooners would do just that besting the No. 7-seeded Wildcats 4-3 at Globe Life Field in Arlington TX.

Getting the start for Skip Johnson’s club was right-hander David Sandlin who would deliver one of his strongest outings of the year in quite arguably the Sooners’ most important game to date.

The JUCO transfer worked seven superb innings allowing just five hits and one earned run while striking out ten Wildcats hitters.

Sandlin whose outing was sensational enough on it's own was pitching with a heavy heart on Saturday after his sister Holli Sandlin passed away earlier in the week.

""I thought David (Sandlin) pitched his guts out"" Johnson said postgame. ""Not many times you see a young man put his team in front of his family. Earlier this week his sister passed away and he pitched with his heart.""

""I think the kids rallied around that.""

The win improved Sandlin's mark to 7-3 on the year continuing his upward climb through the back end of the season.

""I just tried to treat it like any other game"" Sandlin said. ""I knew that she (Holli) would be watching today.""

""Just tried to go out there and give it everything I got and just win for the team for her.""

Offensively Oklahoma got the scoring started right away in the bottom of the first with center fielder Tanner Tredaway continuing his scalding-hot stretch ripping an RBI single that scored Peyton Graham.

Kansas would get that run right back though in the top of the second as former Sooner Justin Mitchell singled to right field with the ball then getting thrown into the OU dugout in an attempt to nail a runner at third base.

The game would remain tied 1-1 through four innings.

At that point the Wildcats snagged their first lead of the afternoon with right fielder Cash Rugely singling to center field to put KSU in front 2-1.

But as they so often have this season Oklahoma would respond.

In the bottom of the sixth with runners on second and third and nobody out OU catcher Jimmy Crooks hammered a clutch two-run double to deep center that put the Sooners back in the lead 3-2.

""They didn't try to do too much at one time"" Johnson said about his team's timely hitting on Saturday.

""They've been really resilient the last month and a half of the season. Really proud of them. Can't say enough about what they do.""

Oklahoma then got an insurance run added onto their lead one inning later with shortstop Peyton Graham smoking a solo home run out to left field - his 16th of the season - to push the OU advantage to 4-2.

The Wildcats weren't about to give up however as Kansas State struck right back for a run in the eighth on an RBI single to left field by Cole Johnson to move back within one run at 4-3.

Right-hander Trevin Michael then managed to settle things down calmly retiring the next two hitters to end the inning.

Michael then finished the job in the ninth retiring Kansas State in order to seal the victory.

""Trevin's (Michael) been like that all year"" Johnson about his closer's strong close to the game.

""The team rallies around those guys (closers). They get comfortable at the end of the game. They know if they got a lead they're going to win the game.""

""He's had an outstanding tournament.""

The win improves Oklahoma to 36-20 on the season and moves them to within one win of claiming the Big 12 tournament.

Next up the Sooners will battle the winner of Saturday’s Oklahoma State/Texas contest in the Big 12 Championship Game at 5 p.m. Sunday evening back at Globe Life Field in Arlington.

""It's going to be awesome"" Crooks said. ""It's going to be hopefully a big crowd out there.""

The Cowboys and the Longhorns are the only two teams in the conference to win series against Oklahoma this season.

""Obviously we dropped the series to both of them"" Graham said. ""So I think we've got a little bit of a chip on our shoulder to go in there and take care of business.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vaG9ybnNpbGx1c3RyYXRlZC5jb20vdGV4YXMtYmFzZWJhbGwtaXZhbi1tZWxlbmRlei1oaXRzLTI5dGgtdGV4YXMtZmFsbHMtdG8tb3UtOC0xL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Baseball Ivan Melendez hits 29th Texas falls to OU 8-1,"No. 19 Texas Baseball falls to OU 8-1 in Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship Game at Globe Life Field

Texas Baseball (42-19) falls to OU 8-1 in the Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship. Before the game was over the NCAA announced that Texas was selected as NCAA Regional host at UFCU Disch-Falk Field for the second-consecutive season and the 28th time ever.

Oklahoma's pitching proved to much for Texas striking out 16 of the 33 batters Texas sent to the plate.

Texas troubles started in the third inning after Travis Sthele was called for a balk pitch that scored OU's second run. Coach Pierce had a heated conversation with the umpire then called time to go to the mound to talk with Sthele. While at the mound Pierce and home plate umpire had more words after plate umpire walked to the mound and appeared to get into Pierce's face. OU scored eight runs in the third that would secure the win and championship.

Texas had only four hits and one run from Melendez' home run. Murphy Stehly doubled Austin Todd and Trey Faltine both had hits. Texas used five pitches.

The Sooners Baseball team claimed the Big 12 Championship with a 8-1 win over rival Texas at Globe Life Field in Arlington Sunday evening.

Texas scored the initial run in the top of the first inning then the Sooners dropped all 8 runs in the bottom of the third.

Oklahoma (37-20) won ten of the last 13 games to end season as Big 12 champions for the first time since 2013.

The Sooners find out who they're playing in regionals on Monday at 11 a.m.

Jan the mom or Holli the sister.

Each staked their claim to leading David Sandlin’s fan club each time he took the mound whether it was at Owasso High School or in college at Eastern Oklahoma State or OU.

They worked to out-cheer the other.

David’s face lit up as he told the memories.

Then he thought of Holli and how she wasn’t inside Globe Life Field on Saturday. But she was still watching.

“I know I wasn’t alone” he said.

'He was himself':OU ace Jake Bennett stuck with routine as he dazzled in dominant win over Texas Tech

On a day the third-seeded Sooners rallied to beat seventh-seeded Kansas State 4-3 to advance to the Big 12 championship game their right-handed redshirt sophomore pitched masterfully with a heavy heart.

Holli died earlier this week from cancer. She was 45.

“She meant the world to me” David said.

OU will face Texas at 5 p.m. Sunday. The championship game appearance is the Sooners’ first since winning the tournament in 2013.

Each rival handed OU a series loss in conference play. Those were the only series the Sooners dropped.

“We got a little chip on our shoulder to go in there and take care of business” OU shortstop Peyton Graham said.

Sandlin was dominant striking out 10 and allowing two runs — one earned — over seven innings. The first-year junior-college transfer allowed just five hits and walked one batter.

He retired the final eight batters he faced.

“I thought David pitched his guts out” OU coach Skip Johnson said. “He pitched with his heart.”

And Sandlin’s OU teammates rallied around him both off the field and on.

On the field the offense came alive late.

Catcher Jimmy Crooks hit a go-ahead double to center in the six that made it 3-2. Graham later hit a line-drive homer to left in the seventh.

“We just really wanted to get the win for him” Graham said. “He’s pitching his heart out out there. I think as an offense collectively we just tried to piece some stuff together to get some runs for him.”

Sandlin stranded five runners on base including two in the fifth when Kansas State had back-to-back singles to score Dominic Hughes who reached after he was hit by a pitch.

“I just wanted to go out there and compete at the highest level” Sandlin said.

And he did while honoring his sister.

Holli had beaten breast cancer in 2018. But she was unable to make games this spring as she underwent treatment when cancer returned in her body. She posted daily TikTok videos mostly goofing around.

Her absence was hard on David. But he was at peace on the mound Saturday.

“She was always just someone that brought a light to the world” David said. “It made her happy to goof around and be around us. It meant the world for me to go out today and play for her.”

The bankers from Goldman Sachs and LionTree came with many deal ideas according to four people with knowledge of the meeting. The most logical one the bankers said was combining some parts of Paramount — which owns networks like Nickelodeon and MTV and the Paramount+ streaming service — with those owned by Comcast the cable giant that owns NBCUniversal and the Peacock streaming service. The two companies already have a streaming joint venture in Europe.

But in the end the board Ms. Redstone and Bob Bakish the company’s chief executive did not feel compelled to pursue any of the combinations. They would continue to zig while Hollywood zagged.

His second restaurant downtown is again welcoming tour buses full of visitors from India craving familiar tastes. And his eatery on the Vegas strip Divine Dosa & Biryani is benefiting from the return of gamblers to the casinos.

Parikh 47 still has plenty of headaches including a worker shortage and rising prices for staples such as lamb. But having weathered the worst of the coronavirus pandemic his restaurants are rebounding as weary consumers shift from buying goods to spending on services such as dining out.

“Tourists are coming back. We are seeing an uptick in traffic. Weekends are busy” said Parikh. “In April 2020 we had absolutely no business. Are we turning the corner? Absolutely.”

For more than two years while Americans rode out the pandemic by bingeing on televisions furniture and home projects businesses that relied on face-to-face commerce suffered. Movie theaters went dark. Airplanes flew empty. Restaurants starved.

Now consumers are returning to their previous habits with the balance between goods and services spending back to where it stood in May 2020 according to data adjusted for inflation from Flexport a freight forwarder. A separate metric cited by Goldman Sachs shows goods consumption about 5 percent higher from before the pandemic down from a peak gap of 15 percent.

“We are just in the early stages of seeing the rotation of consumer spending from goods to services. As time goes on you are going to see more of that. Food services are quite strong. Travel is picking up airfares and hotel occupancy” said Kathy Bostjancic chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “The consumer is looking more to services spending especially with spring and summer upon us.”

The shift toward services reflecting consumers thirsty to resume their previous lifestyles is good news and not just for business owners like Parikh. It also could ease pressure on stressed supply chains and help the Federal Reserve in its campaign to cool inflation.

The change is evident throughout the economy. Retail sales in April were up 8 percent from a year earlier according to the advance estimate from the Commerce Department which does not take inflation into account. But spending at restaurants and bars jumped nearly 20 percent. In March spending on services adjusted for inflation hit a record $8.6 trillion topping the previous mark set in February 2020.

Hotelier Marriott said global room demand from leisure travelers in the first quarter was 10 percent above 2019 bookings. And Southwest Airlines said its quarterly operating revenue by the end of June will top levels before the pandemic.

But Target one of the largest retailers in the country was caught off guard in recent weeks as consumer preferences abruptly shifted leaving it with a mountain of products like appliances and televisions that it was forced to discount.

“Are we back to normal? No. Are we headed back to normal? Yes” said Chris Rogers principal supply chain economist for Flexport in London.

From the outset of the pandemic Americans trapped at home took solace in buying things. Things to use at home. Things to improve the home. Things to wear at home.

This goods boom and services bust reversed the usual pattern of consumer behavior during a recession. Tough times typically prompt people to postpone purchases of big-ticket items. But instead with millions of Americans working from home dry cleaners and hotels suffered while online orders soared.

Multiple rounds of federal stimulus combined with the easy money policies of the central bank helped support consumption while the economy healed. Over the past year as the unemployment rate steadily dropped ample job opportunities fueled continued spending on goods.

Much of what Americans bought came from overseas factories particularly in China and clogged global supply chains. By last spring the collision between surging demand and constricted supply was pushing prices up. At the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said for most of 2021 that the supply snarls would prove temporary and prices would ease.

That has not happened. Executives at Target had expected some of the froth in consumer demand to taper off this year with the waning of stimulus dollars. But the speed and extent of the shift caught them flat-footed.

The retailer ended up with too much of some goods especially bulky items like televisions and appliances and not enough of others. Suddenly hot were items like trendy fashions for people resuming their social lives as well as sunscreen and cosmetics for travelers executives told analysts this month.

The company opted to cut prices on surplus goods which eased its inventory backlog at the expense of quarterly profits. “While we anticipated a post-stimulus slowdown” and “we expect the consumer to continue refocusing their spending away from goods and into services” said chief executive Brian Cornell “we didn’t anticipate the magnitude of that shift.”

The new consumer mood may be starting to affect supply chains. Demand for trucking has dropped by about a third since the beginning of March though it remains elevated according to the market demand index at Truckstop.com.

Jason Hilsenbeck president of Load Match an equipment clearinghouse in Illinois said the drop in demand is hitting new entrants to the short-haul trucking business. More than 2500 new operations with one to two people entered the market since early 2021 hoping to capitalize on elevated freight demand he said.

“The small trucking companies who made a killing last year on the high paying spot market are the first not to have loads when the freight volumes come down” he said in an email.

The number of imported shipping containers reaching the Port of Los Angeles has been below its figure last year for seven straight weeks. On Friday the backlog of container ships loitering offshore numbered 25 down from a record of 109 in January according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California which tracks vessels entering the top import gateway in the country.

Given the lag between when American companies place orders for imports and when the goods arrive in Southern California it is not clear these changes reflect shifting consumer tastes according to Gene Seroka executive director of the port. Goods arriving in Los Angeles this week were ordered three to four months ago he said.

But Seroka does anticipate an easing of import volumes this year. At some point accelerated goods purchases exhaust potential demand. Consumers who bought a new refrigerator or remodeled their homes last year will not do that again this year. “You will see a little bit of a leveling maybe a tempering of imports and then more into the services sector” he said.

That kind of shift could contribute to an easing of inflationary supply chain disruptions that the Powell says have been “larger and longer-lasting than anticipated.” Other factors that could constrict supplies and push up prices lie beyond the control of the central bank including fallout from the war in Ukraine and harsh lockdowns in China to arrest the spread of the coronavirus.

Over the past year the prices of durable goods have risen by 14 percent while the cost of services has increased 5.4 percent according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

A shift to higher services spending might also reshape demand for labor. During the pandemic the goods producing and transporting sectors have outshone services. The online retail surge added almost 675000 warehouse workers. Factory employment has just about regained its February 2020 level while employment in industries with direct consumer interaction such as hotels and restaurants remains depressed.

Almost 1.5 million leisure and hospitality jobs that existed in February 2020 have vanished according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising interest rates by half a point at each of its next two meetings in a bid to slow consumer price increases. With almost two job openings for every seeker there is room to cool business hiring without eliminating existing positions.

“There will be a rebalancing of demand for workers. But I don’t necessarily look for large layoffs” Bostjancic said. Indeed the shift in consumer preferences has been gradual.

Even as consumers change their buying plans Target is ordering earlier than usual to make sure it has the right goods in stock to satisfy demand several months from now. Such precautionary ordering designed to stay ahead of congested supply chains helps keep them congested.

In Las Vegas meanwhile Parikh is waiting for the convention crowds to return. While monthly tourist traffic is about 10 percent below 2019 levels attendance at industry conventions remains more than 40 percent lower than three years ago according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vZmluYW5jZS1hbmQtZWNvbm9taWNzLzIwMjIvMDUvMjkvdGhlLWNoYW5naW5nLWFtZXJpY2FuLWNvbnN1bWVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The changing American consumer,"A sked recently about Amazon’s sprawling network of warehouses Brian Olsavsky the firm’s finance chief did not mince words. “We have too much space right now.” As consumer demand surged during the pandemic the online retailer doubled its capacity from 193m square feet (18m square metres) at the end of 2019 to 387m square feet two years later. Today it has a glut which the company says is costing it tens of millions of dollars a day.

Retailers are bracing themselves for a slowdown as central banks raise interest rates. But Amazon’s troubles reflect another crucial development for the global economy: a shift in spending from goods back to services reversing a pandemic-era trend.

The final stop in Hartford capped a month-long run which heard the band deliver impressively tight performances almost every night along the tour. Throughout the 1977 spring run the Dead delivered memorable shows including their famous concert at Cornell University’s Barton Hall on May 8th Buffalo’s War Memorial Auditorium on May 9th and The Sportatorium in Pembroke Pines FL on May 22nd.

Fans who attended the tour-closing performance were treated to fantastic live takes of “Bertha” “Good Lovin'” “Sugaree” “Row Jimmy” “Candyman” and “Brown Eyed Women” in the first set and “Tennessee Jed” “Estimated Prophet” “Terrapin Station” “Not Fade Away” and “One More Saturday Night” in the second.

The 72-year-old New Hartford resident who died Thursday according to law enforcement served as an officer with the New Hartford police in the 1970s. His son the late Joseph D. Corr followed in his steps as a New Hartford police officer but was shot and killed in 2006 while pursuing a jewelry store robbery suspect in the town of Kirkland.

In the wake of his son's death Corr became an advocate for families who had lost someone in the line of duty a statement from the New Hartford Police Department said.

""As our department suffered the loss of a member it was Dave and his family that gave us the strength to carry on our commitment to serve and protect our community"" the statement said.

A report Saturday from the town of Inlet Police Department determined Corr's cause of death to be a heart attack while canoeing near his camp in Inlet.

""The Town of Inlet Police Department has always considered David Corr a close friend to our agency"" the report concluded. ""Our agency sends its sincerest condolences to the family.""

Joseph Corr tribute:'We do miss him'

10 year anniversary:Officer Corr remembered

Other law enforcement agencies mourned the loss of Corr. A statement from the Oneida County Sheriff's Office described his support of law enforcement.

""Since their own tragedy in 2006 you could always count on Dave and his family to be at every event and supporting our local law enforcement community"" a statement from the Utica Police Department said.

""We lost a good friend"" the statement from New Hartford police concluded.

Rob said “This season we’re focusing on plays that we hope inspire our audiences to come see LIVE theater. Great music captivating stories and world-class writing – these stories are uplifting powerful … and will engage us all in important conversations. We’re particularly excited that they are written by four female playwrights representing the best and most important voices in American theater. These plays tell our stories.”

QUEEN OF BASEL a “provocative exploration of race class gender and Latinx identity” (DCist) by Hilary Bettis will run February 4 through March 5. Rob said “I read this play when it first appeared and immediately responded to it’s passion and unique articulation of Julie and John’s fiery relationship. A ‘contemporary retelling’ of a classic I have no doubt audiences will be rewarded with a powerful evening of theater.”

Alison Bechdel (FUN HOME Graphic Novelist) is a cartoonist and graphic memoirist exploring the complexities of familial relationships in multilayered works that use the interplay of word and image to weave sophisticated narratives. Bechdel’s command of sequential narrative and her aesthetic as a visual artist was established in her long-running comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For (1983–2008) which realistically captured the lives of women in the lesbian community as they influenced and were influenced by the important cultural and political events of the day. Garnering a devoted and diverse following this pioneering work was a precursor to her book-length graphic memoirs. Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic (2006) is a nuanced depiction of a childhood spent in an artistic family in a small Pennsylvania town and of her relationship with her father a high school English teacher and funeral home director. An impeccable observer and record keeper Bechdel incorporates drawings of archival materials such as diaries letters photographs and news clippings as well as a variety of literary references in deep reflections into her own past. With storytelling that is striking for its conceptual depth and complexity in structure as well as for the deft use of allusion and reference Bechdel is changing our notions of the contemporary memoir and expanding the expressive potential of the graphic form.

“This has been a focus for us for a long time” said Dennis Marnick senior vice president of flagship leasing at the mall's owner Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield. “We knew that we wanted to add more layers to the experience at Garden State Plaza.""

Hasbro and Kingsmen Xperience the U.S. branch of an Asian firm that builds interactive attractions will open the first North American location of Nerf Action Xperience and the world’s first Planet Playskool kids experience at the mall by the end of 2023 the companies announced in a statement last week.

Paramus is one of the best retail markets in the country making it the perfect home for these two new experiences Marnick said. With a well-performing AMC movie theater the mall wanted to add opportunities for family entertainment which led them to connect with Kingsmen Xperience he said.

Planet Playskool will be a 20000-square-foot indoor entertainment center focused on children and families that will let them play and try out different toys such as Play-Doh from Playskool a subsidiary of Hasbro Inc. that produces educational toys and games.

""They have these legacy brands that your grandpa knows or your dad knows and now the child knows"" Marnick said. ""I look at it as a really cool family experience not just focused on children.""

The 25000-square-foot Nerf Action Xperience will offer a variety of obstacle courses for all age groups. The venue will be available for birthday parties team-building events and other gatherings Marnick added.

The two indoor entertainment centers will be in the area of the former J.C. Penney store which closed in 2018. The east side of the space became home to flagship stores such as Old Navy Champs Sports lululemon and Adidas. On the west side near Neiman Marcus the mall saw an opportunity to bring entertainment opportunities especially since Garden State Plaza is planning on adding residential development.

""We’re looking at 150000 square feet in the center of our shopping center"" Marnick said. ""We feel like that’s really going to remake that side of the shopping center.""

The two new entertainment centers will join The Arena STEM an existing indoor amusement center that offers STEM activities and workshops.

This time Hasbro the toy company spread the information about their latest project accidentally.

The accidental publishing of the development website for their storefront Hasbro Pulse shows us how we can turn ourselves into the main character with a brand new line of action figures.

You can be whoever you want to

Discovered by Twitter user @Martian_Ranger the Hasbro Pulse Selfie Series includes a list of 13 figure options all priced at $59.99 from all of the major Hasbro action figure lines.

So far seems like the series characters include Snake Eyes from the G.I. Joe Classified Series Spider-Man Black Widow Iron Man and Black Panther from the Marvel Legends Series Rebel Princess Rebel Pilot Mandalorian Warrior and Stormtrooper from the Star Wars Black Series a male Ghostbuster from the Plasma Series and the Mighty Morphin Red and Pink Rangers from the Power Rangers Lightning Collection.

Turn into the Red Ranger or Iron Man the choice is yours.

You may be wondering how can it be possible well that is the simple part; the use of custom head sculpts.

As we were saying the leak was accidental and the page was up for just an hour however a pair of screenshots are making waves online. We will leave you the box prototype below:

This new product series page was only up for about an hour before it was pulled down but in this short time the pictures present on it were able to be saved.

Up to this point Hasbro hasn’t confirmed anything regarding this collection neither the final price would be nor how the process for making your own custom head sculpt would occur.

To be entirely honest I’m kinda blown away by what Hasbro brought to Star Wars Celebration. Their presentation is exactly what many of us collectors have been wanting to see from their various livestreams for years now. There’s a variety of figures cool new surprises and timely reveals (beyond the LOLA toys shown earlier yesterday). Let’s break it down:

1 of 5

Let’s talk about The Vintage Collection (3.75 inch) figures first!

There’s Antoc Merrick’s R2 unit that will also fit inside the Antoc X-wing that released this past year. A new “troop builder” 4-pack this time featuring the Rebel Soldiers from the Battle of Hoth. The “Wandering Jedi” Obi-Wan Kenobi from the new show. And there’s this incredible looking Dark Trooper figure. Even better this one comes with a little container that you can put together and create your own little housing area like we saw in The Mandalorian season 2.

If that’s not enough for you gaming collector’s also got their first look at toys from the newly announced Star Wars Jedi: Survivor game. This will launch as a three-pack to include the Riot Scout Trooper KX Security Droid and MagnaGuard action figures.

While the new Obi-Wan figure and Jedi: Survivor pack are set to arrive this Fall the rest are set to hit in Spring 2023.

1 of 8

Now onto the Black Series (6 inch) which are my personal favorites to collect. While previously announced Hasbro gave our first look at the upcoming Aayla Secura figure finally giving us more Prequel era Jedi who aren’t dudes. We also got a look at the previously announced Darth Maul figure utilizing his appearance from the final season of The Clone Wars—of course I’m always down for more Maul toys. Greef Carga is getting an updated figure to match his look from season two of The Mandalorian and the Gaming Greats line is getting the Riot Control Scout Trooper from Star Wars Jedi: Survivor!

1 of 5

Fans who enjoyed the new villains from the Obi-Wan Kenobi series also got a treat with the reveal of new figures (on top of the previously announced Reva figure) based on the Inquisitors seen in the show; the Grand Inquisitor the Fourth Sister and Fifth Brother! Definitely loving the looks of these and as someone who primarily collects villain related toys I’m all kinds of excited to see them.

Lastly in the Black Series line is probably my favorite reveal so far: Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader Concept Art Edition (Shop Disney Exclusive). Some of my favorite toys in the past were the old Ralph McQuarrie concept art figures (from the 30th Anniversary line). They took the look from the original paintings and brought them to life. As such seeing that idea come to the Black Series line is a huge deal for me. I only hope this is the start of many more Concept Art editions to come.

All of the Black Series figures are slated to arrive in Spring 2023. Even better aside from the Concept Art one none of these are exclusives! So you’ll actually have a decent shot of snagging them when pre-orders for all these go live on June 1st at 1pm ET.

I can proudly say I regularly consume — and enjoy — each and every one of the following top 10 candy items although one irritates me because of the thin aluminum-foilish wrapping … Welcome to today’s three thoughts that make up Vol. 296 of The Daily Dirt.

1. Studies show the average American eats about 23 pounds of chocolate a year.

Well first of all I know there are people who simply don’t eat candy especially chocolate … so does that mean there are Americans out there who down 46 pounds of a chocolate each year to balance out the numbers? Author Meaghan Cameron reports the cocoa and chocolate industry in the U.S. pulls in $9.67 billion annually.

“Plus they forecast that the market will only continue to grow over the next few years” Cameron writes.

Not to mention our waistlines.

According to a report done by eatthis.com here are the 10 most popular U.S. candies:

10. 3 Musketeers: In 1932 when 3 Musketeers was born each package contained three candy bars which is how it got its name.

Snickers: In 1930 the very first Snickers was created and it wasn’t named after a giggle — but a horse. More than 48 million Americans consumed Snickers candy bars last year.

(My only comment is what about Milky Way? I would have thought that was a guaranteed top-10 confectionery item.)

2. Three things you should know:– Blueberry Kit Kat candy bars are now a real thing.

Is this a great country or what?– Mark this down and take it to the bank. When Chris Archer retires as an MLB pitcher he will be the Next Big Thing as an analyst. This guy whose spirit is infectious is so well spoken and knowledgeable he is a sure-fire bet for a frontline broadcasting position.– The three best gel pens on the market in no particular order are: Energel Pilot G-2 and Sarasa. The Sarasa model is relatively new to the party but is an excellent choice and like the other two has an impressive selection of colors to choose from.

3. Three of the most interesting quotes I have ever found connected to rock music:

Gold medal: “The hippies wanted peace and love. We wanted Ferraris blondes and switchblades.” — Alice Cooper.

Silver medal: “Rock n’ roll is a poison put to sound.” — Pablo Casals.

Bronze medal: “The whole world loves American movies blue jeans jazz and rock and roll. It is probably a better way to get to know our country than by what politicians or airline commercials represent.“- Billy Joel.

After Saturday that number is now three. Central Mountain’s David Lindsay made history for the Wildcats on Saturday at the Hershey Racquet Club by becoming Central Mountain’s first state champion in boys tennis after he defeated South Fayette’s Jacob Patterson in a three-set thriller 4-6 6-4 6-3.

“I am very happy that all of David’s countless hours of hard work paid off for him and his family” Central Mountain coach Pete Wert said. “He is a wonderful player and an even better person.”

The list of District 6 players to win a state championship which dates back to 1960 prior to Saturday was a short one. State College’s Todd Lundy of District 6 won three straight state singles titles from 1973-75. State College’s Tom Wright won the 1969 singles title.

Lindsay is the first area player in Express history to win the state championship in boys tennis and did so by rallying back after dropping his first set 6-4. Lindsay then won the second set 6-4 to force the decisive third and final set and edged Patterson 6-3.

“The final was difficult mentally and physically as he was behind and Jacob was playing incredibly well” Wert said. “David stayed confident and fought hard to come back.”

Lindsay won his opening round matchup at the PIAA Class AAA boys tennis tournament in Hershey with a 6-3 6-1 win against Dallastown’s Jonathan Arbittier. In the second round Lindsay beat Lower Merion’s Brian Yi 6-1 6-2.

“His forehand was on point and he was able to pass Patterson several times throughout the match” Wert said. “It was a very redeeming victory after losing last year to the champ in three sets.”

This year’s gold medal is the first state medal for Lindsay a sophomore. As a freshman last year Lindsay fell in the Class AAA quarterfinals in Hershey to eventual champion Vikas Miller of Lower Merion 3-6 6-4 7-5.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2VyaWUuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC90ZW5uaXMvMjAyMi8wNS8yOS9waWFhLXRlbm5pcy1mcmVzaG1hbi1qb25haC1uZy1tYWtlcy1jYXRoZWRyYWwtcHJlcC1oaXN0b3J5LWZhaXJ2aWV3LWRvdWJsZXMtc2VydHotdHVyYWdhLWtpc2llbC82NTM1NzY1MjAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Freshman makes Cathedral Prep tennis history; Fairview doubles team wins medals,"Erie Times-News

HERSHEY ― A Cathedral Prep singles player started his PIAA tennis career with a milestone medal Saturday at Hershey Racquet Club.

Meanwhile a Fairview doubles team made sure that a longtime coach closed his boys tennis tenure with a medal-winning performance.

Cathedral Prep has a decorated tennis history particularly in the past decade but freshman Jonah Ng became the first singles player in Prep history to earn a medal.

The Ramblers had won five doubles state championships and had finished second in doubles twice.

But Ng made history by placing fourth in the PIAA Class 2A singles tournament over the weekend. Ng won twice on Friday to advance to the bracket's final four. He then lost to North Catholic's Nicolas Scheller 6-0 6-2 Saturday morning before dropping the afternoon third-place match against Lancaster Country Day's Nile Abadir 6-2 6-4.

However thanks to his semifinal appearance Ng received a PIAA medal to commemorate his memorable freshman season. He took District 10 by storm this year rolling through the regular season and then dominating the District 10 Class 2A singles tournament.

He won twice Friday sweeping D-5 champ Liam Egal of Somerset 6-0 6-0 in the opening round and then claiming a dramatic three-set win over Lancaster Country Day junior Freddie Bloom the District 3 runner-up in the quarterfinals by a score of 6-1 3-6 7-6 (4).

""We are very proud of Jonah’s accomplishments this weekend"" Prep coach Pat Grab said. ""He was the last standing freshman in singles for both 2A and 3A.""

The performance sets up the future nicely for Ng who has three more years to pursue District 10 titles PIAA medals and maybe – as he grows and fine-tunes his game – a state title.

However Grab basked in the thought of such a young player achieving such a rare feat for a school like Prep with such a glorious sports history.

""The last (singles) medalist from District 10 was (McDowell star) Landon Williams in 2010 and 2009"" Grab said. ""Before that it was Don Johnson in 1984. It simply does not happen that often from our area.""

Sertz coaches final boys match

In PIAA doubles action Fairview seniors Aravind Turaga and Nate Kisiel made sure they went out – and their coach went out – with a medal over the weekend at the Hershey Racquet Club.

Turaga and Kisiel claimed a Class 2A doubles medal by winning twice Friday and advancing to the PIAA's final four.

That achievement capped the final season for head coach Rick Sertz who announced after the D-10 tournament that he would retire as Fairview's boys tennis coach at the end of the season. He will continue as the Tigers' girls tennis coach.

Sertz 61 has been the Fairview boys coach for 24 seasons. His teams have won 18 District 10 team championships and he has guided the Tigers to a team record of 372-77.

Turaga and Kisiel secured their medals Friday with wins in the first round and quarterfinals. They beat the D-5 champions Bedford's Nick Beard and Tristen Ruffley 6-1 6-2 and then followed with a 6-2 7-6 (4) victory over Wade Stoltzfus and Jazae Iteg of Pequea Valley.

The Tigers' duo lost in the Saturday morning semifinals to WPIAL champions from North Catholic Brody Golla and Alex Garvey 6-4 6-1. Daniel Li and Kevin McHale of team state champion Masterman then beat Turaga and Kisiel 6-4 6-1 in the third-place match."

For example Nvidia—a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) that do the heavy lifting for a wide range of computationally intense systems such as those in AI—believes that by 2023 advanced AI models could entail 100 trillion or more connections rivaling the number of synapses in the human brain.

Those kinds of numbers which far outstrip what can be handled a single processor will require massive amounts of data to flow rapidly from one application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to another within data centers. Much of that chip-to-chip communication still takes place via copper interconnects in the electrical domain. And shunting around those immense data volumes will consume large perhaps cost-prohibitive amounts of power.

One company seeking to help solve that problem is the Silicon Valley-based Ayar Labs which is developing a line of CMOS-friendly low-power optical input/output (I/O) products to feed the market for interconnects in high-performance computing and AI. Nvidia seems to find the approach promising. On 25 May Ayar and Nvidia announced that they were collaborating on “integrating Ayar Labs’ technology to develop scale-out architectures enabled by high-bandwidth low-latency and ultra-low-power optical-based interconnects for future Nvidia products.”

A focus on the interconnects

A number of early-stage and startup companies are working to carve out a place for photonics in aspects of AI and high-performance computing. Some such as Lightelligence and Lightmatter are developing “AI accelerator” chips—intricate next-gen photonic integrated circuits that tackle entirely in the optical domain the power-hungry repeated matrix multiplications required by AI computing. But Mark Wade an Ayar Labs cofounder and the firm’s CTO stresses that’s not what his company is about.

“It’s an important distinction to say that we are not doing that” he told OPN. Instead of optical computing according to Wade Ayar focuses on “optically enabled computing”—and in particular on solving the bandwidth–distance bottleneck increasingly faced by traditional computer architectures relying on electronic host ASICs.

As computing demands have mushroomed Wade says “the trend has been that these ASICs have been trying to move more and more bandwidth between different packages.” And while a lot of the communication within data centers happens in the optical domain much of the package-to-package communication is still done electrically along copper interconnects. That sets up a trade-off: The more copper and the greater the I/O distance in the electrical domain the less bandwidth can flow from chip to chip with sufficiently low latency and power requirements.

TeraPHY and SuperNova

Ayar Labs aims to break that bottleneck Wade says through “a new class of photonic integration and technologies and products” that “really push the electrical-to-optical conversion as close to the host ASIC as possible.”

One element of this is an optical I/O “chiplet” called TeraPHY (yes it’s pronounced “terrify”). The chiplet is designed to be flip-chip bonded to the same substrate as an ASIC (such as an Nvidia GPU) and sit directly next to it. Data-carrying light is fed via a ribbon of single-mode fiber connections into (or out of) the chiplet where a system of microring resonators decodes the light signal into an electrical one (or vice versa).

“The whole point” says Wade “is to take the high bandwidth coming out of the host SoC [system on chip] convert it to the optical domain as fast as possible and then have a much more scalable way to move massive amounts of bandwidth with low energy [over] long distances.” And he adds the level of miniaturization and integration enabled by the microring-resonator architecture enables the optical-to-electrical/electrical-to-optical conversion to happen “at a starting point that’s much denser and ultimately much more energy efficient” than traditional products like pluggable transceivers that are aimed at the more mature optical-communications market.

The other core component of Ayar’s system is the company’s SuperNova laser light source which sits on a different chip and can produce 16 wavelengths of light delivered into 16 fibers (each of which can itself carry up to 16 wavelengths). This disaggregates the light source from the ASIC package which the company believes affords more flexible deployment across applications and easier replaceability of parts in the field.

“Massive” market opportunity

The partnership with Nvidia is only one of a flurry of announcements that have come from Ayar Labs in the past few months. An earlier announcement in February 2022 unveiled a strategic collaboration between Ayar and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to develop “silicon photonics solutions based on optical I/O technology.”

Subsequently in late April Ayar Labs reported that it had snagged US$130 million in Series C funding from an investor group that included HPE Nvidia Intel Global Foundries and a variety of venture-capital partners. That chunk of cash Wade told OPN will be used for “maturing our commercial operations our manufacturing and supply-chain operations our qualification cycles and really setting the stage to build a company that can deliver millions of these parts to multiple market segments.”

This year the numbers will be smaller; Ayar Labs expects to ship thousands of units to early-stage customers in 2022. “That’s not yet massive volume” Wade acknowledges. “But our ability to deliver thousands of units sets the stage for how we plan to scale into the future.”

And Wade—who has been “working on this technology for more than a decade now and working on commercializing it in our labs for the last five or six years”—firmly believes that the demand will be there.

“This solution that we’re building is not a niche solution that’s targeting one market segment” he maintains. “It’s actually going to be a ubiquitous problem that that multiple market segments and customers start facing. And we think the overall market opportunity there as we go into the middle and second half of this decade is truly massive.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhdHJpY2ttb29yaGVhZC8yMDIyLzA1LzI5L2hwLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5ldy1zcGVjdHJlLWFuZC1lbnZ5LWRldmljZXMtYWltZWQtYXQtaHlicmlkLXdvcmstYW5kLWNyZWF0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Launches New Spectre And Envy Devices Aimed At Hybrid Work And Creators,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2022/05/29/hp-launches-new-spectre-and-envy-devices-aimed-at-hybrid-work-and-creators/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhdHJpY2ttb29yaGVhZC8yMDIyLzA1LzI5L2hwLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5ldy1zcGVjdHJlLWFuZC1lbnZ5LWRldmljZXMtYWltZWQtYXQtaHlicmlkLXdvcmstYW5kLWNyZWF0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaGlwcGV3YS9uYW1lL3RvZGQtYW5kcmluZ2Etb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQ5NjA4MjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Todd Andringa Obituary (1959 - 2022) - Chippewa Falls WI - The Chippewa Herald,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/chippewa/name/todd-andringa-obituary?id=34960826 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaGlwcGV3YS9uYW1lL3RvZGQtYW5kcmluZ2Etb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQ5NjA4MjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZndlZWsudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMjkvamFzb24ta29rcmFrLWNoYXJsZXMtc2Nod2FiLWZhc3Rlc3Qtcm91bmRzLXBnYS10b3VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PGA Tour: Jason Kokrak finishes round in just over 2 hours at Colonial,"FORT WORTH Texas — Jason Kokrak entered this week at the Charles Schwab Challenge glowing about the truck that came with his victory at Colonial Country Club in 2021 noting that he recently took his kids to school in the renovated light blue 1946 Dodge Power Wagon.

He ended the week by motoring.

Off alone as the first player out of the gate on Sunday the reigning champion flew through his round and when he tapped in for bogey on the 8th hole in front of the few fans already assembled at the Kokrak Ultra Athletic Club named in his honor only 61 minutes had elapsed.

Kokrak didn’t pull out the pin on No. 8 and it was obvious he’d become frustrated after posting four bogeys in six holes after opening his round with an eagle and a birdie.

After recording a double on No. 15 and a bogey on 16 Kokrak finished the day with a 72 and was 8 over for the tournament ending his Sunday round in 133 minutes. He didn’t finish last of those who made the cut however as Harry Higgs used four doubles to finish well behind Kokrak.

Quite the contrast from a year ago when his hot putter helped Kokrak win a duel with Jordan Spieth on Sunday to claim his second PGA Tour title. He followed that with a victory at the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Houston Open just six months later.

Although Kokrak hustled through his round he didn’t break any records in the process.

Last September Joaquin Niemann toured East Lake Golf Club in one hour 53 minutes at The Tour Championship which is the official record for the fastest round on Tour — although officials have never been one to tout the achievement since ultra-fast play isn’t encouraged. Kevin Na had played the final round of the 2016 Tour Championship in 1 hour 59 minutes.

The unofficial record was set by Wesley Bryan who played the 2017 BMW Championship in one hour 29 minutes.

Even though he didn’t fare well this week Kokrak — a North Bay Ontario native — insists he’s still keen on the Lone Star State and mentioned earlier in the week that he wouldn’t rule out eventually living here.

“My cousin used to live in Houston and he always jokes that I should move to Texas because I’ve had so much success here” he said. “You never know; I might become a Texan later on in life.”",,,

It opened as a part of a series of new Hilton hotels being developed in the area including the adjacent Waldorf Astoria Cancun (opening in September) the Conrad Tulum Riviera Maya and the Hilton Tulum Riviera Maya an All-Inclusive Resort.

I was particularly excited for this hotel to open as the renderings looked incredible resembling a higher-end Conrad hotel more than a typical Hilton. Of course finished products don't always live up to expectations so I wanted to experience the new resort firsthand and a recent trip to Mexico was the perfect opportunity for me to do so. My stay would be about five months after the property first opened its doors giving it plenty of time to iron out any new-hotel kinks.

Here's how it went.

Ready to book or just looking? Take our one-question survey.

Cost

Rooms here usually cost between $500 and $700 per night based on double occupancy but sometimes drop below $400 during less busy times of the year. The deal is even sweeter for families. Now through at least Dec. 15 children ages 12 and younger stay free while kids ages 13-17 will incur a $150 nightly charge. Just be sure to include the correct number of guests during booking or you may have fees added on later.

Alternatively you can book your stay with Hilton Honors points. An award night usually costs a flat 95000 points for two adults. As usual Silver Gold and Diamond Hilton elite members receive their fifth night free on award stays. You can get automatic Hilton elite status by carrying any of the program's cobranded credit cards.

The Hilton Cancun is located on a secluded stretch of the coastline behind a mangrove nature preserve. It's about 20 minutes from Cancun International Airport (CUN) and 30 minutes south of the busy hotel zone. The forthcoming Waldorf Astoria Cancun will be located right next door and guests have access to a complimentary shuttle to the Canopy by Hilton Cancun La Isla if they want to visit the more touristy area of Cancun.

I arrived around 2 p.m. but the check-in process wasn't the quickest. The front desk felt understaffed for a resort this size and there was no dedicated line for elite members. However the soothing lemongrass scent wafting through the lobby and apple-cinnamon welcome drink helped pass the time.

As a top-tier Diamond elite I didn't get an automatic upgrade ahead of my stay and wasn't proactively upgraded during check-in but I did receive a great multiple-category upgrade after asking. I originally booked an oceanfront king room and was upgraded to an oceanfront one-bedroom suite. The price difference between these rooms is usually around $200 per night — not bad.

The room

Rooms were spread across two connected wings each with its own pools. While noise wasn't an issue my side technically was louder since it faced the kids pool area.

At over 800 square feet my oceanfront one-bedroom suite was spacious complete with separate living and sleeping areas a powder room and a furnished balcony that spanned the entire length of the room.

Upon entering the suite there was a hallway with a minibar closets and on the other side the entrance to the powder room. The bedroom was just off the living room separated by a door.

As expected the room felt modern and fresh and still had that new-hotel smell. The design was minimalist but chic with pops of color and nods to Mexican culture in the artwork.

I particularly loved the wood finishes throughout which added some warmth to the room. The room certainly looked as beautiful as the renderings — if not better – and felt more upscale than a typical Hilton.

But it wasn't just about good looks — the room was functional too. The bed was comfortable the linens were crisp and there were plenty of power outlets and USB ports throughout including on both sides of the bed. I also appreciated the wireless bedside phone charger after having lost my cord.

In addition to the large sofa and dining table in the living room the bedroom had a cushy divan with a small round table by the window and a small workstation tucked away in the corner.

The primary bathroom was separated from the bedroom by a tinted sliding door. It was bright large and beautiful kitted out in marble with double sinks a separate toilet room and a large walk-in shower with frosted-glass doors. While I didn't mind there was no bathtub which some might expect from a suite.

Toiletries weren't from your usual Hilton brand. Rather they were from the Mexican brand Persea Apothecary scented with rosemary and in large-format bottles which felt a bit more luxurious.

The minibar was located by the main entrance and was stocked with various soft drinks Tecate and Dos Equis beer Lay's potato chips peanuts chocolate chip cookies and a Nespresso machine. All items were free of charge.

Amenities

The highlight of the property was its pools. There were two large infinity pools on each side of the hotel.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 Hilton Cancun. BENJI STAWSKI/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2

They looked practically identical but the one closer to the kids club attracted more families while the other attracted more adults. That said there were still splashing kids at both pools and neither of them was particularly quiet.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 BENJI STAWSKI/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3

There were plenty of lounge chairs surrounding the pools as well as some actually inside the water so there was no need to get up early to ""reserve"" them. For better or worse there were no cabanas available not even for a fee.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

Behind the family pool was a kids pool area and splash playground with slides and a giant water bucket.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 BENJI STAWSKI/THE POINTS GUY 0 1

There was also a fully staffed kids club with a variety of daily activities located near the family pool as well as a teen zone for those ages 13 to 17 with activities like sports tournaments and arts and crafts. Put simply the hotel was very family-friendly.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

The private beach was long but unfortunately overrun with seaweed — a problem for many resorts in the area. Oddly there were no water sports or activities like beach volleyball available.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

While there were a few group fitness classes like morning yoga the daytime activities were limited for adults. Water aerobics was on the schedule but didn't actually end up taking place.

Likewise although there was a nightly show for families such as a performance of ""Aladdin"" the evening entertainment was lacking. For instance there wasn't even a DJ playing on a Friday night.

(Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy)

The gym was on the smaller side for a property of this size but still had all of the necessities such as free weights treadmills and stationary bikes. It was open from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

It would've been nice if the property also had some sports courts but it didn't. Interestingly there also wasn't a spa on site but guests will have access to the one at the adjacent Waldorf Astoria once it opens.

Food and drink

The Hilton Cancun is home to 10 restaurants and bars including a buffet Mexican restaurant Asian restaurant Italian restaurant and steakhouse. With the exception of the buffet and Sunan (the Asian outlet) all restaurants required reservations for dinner but I never had trouble booking a table. All restaurants were also part of the all-inclusive experience so I didn't pay anything further out of pocket to dine anywhere at the resort.

Overall the food quality was pretty good but certainly not memorable. The menus had icons to distinguish vegetarian gluten-free and dairy-free items but I found the vegetarian options to be lacking.

Vela – international buffet

The buffet was open for breakfast lunch and dinner. The food was solid and there were several live cooking stations but the selection was pretty consistent from day to day so it could get repetitive if you ate here every day. I particularly enjoyed the cooked-to-order omelets in the mornings and fresh sashimi available every day for lunch and dinner. Staples like pancakes cold cuts burgers and a salad bar were also available. The space itself was very large and I never had trouble getting a table either indoors or outdoors even during peak times.

Sunan – Asian cuisine

Unlike most all-inclusives I've been to the Asian restaurant Sunan was open for lunch and dinner and didn't need reservations. It offered tasty options like fresh spring rolls sushi rolls pad thai bowls ramen and grilled skewers.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

The restaurant had a beautiful setting overlooking the beach but it was set up more as a lounge with sofa seating and low tables which I didn't think were very comfortable for eating. So although the food was great for that reason I'd recommend coming here for a quick lunch or pre-dinner snacks rather than a full meal.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1

Maxal – Mexican dishes

The Mexican restaurant doubled as a taqueria for lunch and a full-service restaurant for dinner. Although the space was tastefully decorated the food was unfortunately the most underwhelming I had at the property. Dishes included grilled bone marrow quesadillas and fish tacos but overall the food lacked flavor and didn't feel very authentic.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

La Luce – Italian cuisine

Although I didn't have high expectations for the Italian restaurant it ended up being one of my favorites. It was a beautiful space with bubble-like lights suspended above the space and an open kitchen complete with a wood-fired pizza oven. My Napoletana pizza with arugula was light fluffy and absolutely delicious. Other menu items included pasta and some heartier options like braised short rib.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

Auma – steakhouse

The fanciest restaurant was Auma located just off the lobby. The menu was centered around the grill featuring items like charred beet carpaccio grilled ahi tuna and New York strip steaks.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

Food carts

During the day there were food carts by both of the pools serving fresh burgers and grilled seafood. They didn't have any vegetarian options.

Azulinda Market and Cafe

Open from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. was the lobby coffee shop and cafe Azulinda. It offered everything from morning pastries to made-to-order sandwiches pizzas and other snacks.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

La Churreria – dessert shop

For those craving sweets there was a dessert shop located across from the kids club that served fresh churros ice cream and other sweets.

Bars

No matter what part of the property you're in you're never too far from a bar. The drinks didn't taste watered down and there were a number of high-end brands available like Belvedere Grey Goose and Johnnie Walker Black Label — you just needed to remember to specifically request them.

I enjoyed my mango daiquiri which was the perfect balance of sweet and sour. The bar by the family pool also had some great nonalcoholic options like horchata and tamarind agua fresca. You could either walk up to a bar to place an order or order drinks through the servers that passed by regularly.

Room service

Finally there was 24-hour room service available at no extra cost. The food typically took an hour to arrive and wasn't great. The guacamole and chicken soup were bland while the fries in particular were very soggy.

Service

As mentioned the front desk felt a bit understaffed so check-in and checkout were a bit slow. There were also several power outages during my stay (around 30 minutes long) with no communication from the staff. Aside from that though the service was generally good and the staff seemed genuinely excited to be working there. Although Hilton now offers housekeeping only by request at most hotels my room was still meticulously cleaned every day without having to ask.

Overall impression

The Hilton Cancun is a beautiful new resort — really kudos to the designers the property felt very upscale. And although not necessarily memorable the food was perfectly fine for an all-inclusive. However given that the beach wasn't really swimmable and the entertainment was limited for adults the only real thing to do was lounge by the (noisy) pool so I started to feel borderline — dare I say — bored after a few days. I probably won't be rushing back anytime soon myself but would definitely recommend it to families particularly those with younger children.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaG91c2VrZWVwZXJzLXN0cnVnZ2xlLWFzLXUtcy1ob3RlbHMtZGl0Y2gtZGFpbHktcm9vbS1jbGVhbmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Housekeepers struggle as U.S. hotels ditch daily room cleaning,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

With a perfect backdrop for meetings and events the 619-key dual-branded Hilton properties along with the 60000 sq. ft Hilton Convention Centre offer an integrated solution for many corporates as they return to business. While the 353-key Hilton Garden Inn Hotel opened for business earlier this year the 266-key flagship-brand Hilton and the Convention Centre opened on May 1 2022. Manish Garg General Manager- Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn Bengaluru Embassy Manyata Business Park in this interaction with TTJ sheds further insight on India’s newest hospitality and MICE address.

– Rachita Sehgal

Q. With a vast experience in hospitality and currently holding the reins of Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn Bengaluru Embassy Manyata Business Park what value have you added to the brand?

With over two decades in the hospitality industry I have gained well-rounded experience in the hotel business with demonstrated success and expertise in planning developing and directing effective business strategies for pre-opening hotels and revenue streams. I believe with conviction that the Hilton values I live- Integrity Teamwork Leadership and Ownership have helped me contribute to Hilton’s mission of creating heartfelt experiences for guests meaningful opportunities for team members high value for owners and a positive impact in our communities. Having spent close to seven years in Bengaluru I have cultivated a reliable network of professional and social contacts that help me bring sharp business acumen reliable market insights and robust hospitality competencies to my role as General Manager of Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn Bengaluru Embassy Manyata Business Park.

Q. You have been associated with the Hilton Group for a long time. How exciting is it to work with new properties?

I look forward to getting to work every day as it brings new opportunities and challenges too! This is what makes hotel pre-opening especially rewarding. Engaging with multiple stakeholders who bring a variety of viewpoints bring about consensus and make decisions collectively that are efficient and sustainable for the business gives me a great sense of achievement and satisfaction. I am fortunate to have a driven and motivated team of subject matter specialists in their respective domains. Working together has helped us achieve the various milestones successfully thus far as we are inching close to opening one of South India’s largest integrated hotel complexes in the heart of Namma Bengaluru. Hilton Garden Inn Bengaluru has already started on a very successful commercial note and feedback from guests has been equally rewarding. We now look forward to successfully opening the Hilton Bengaluru Embassy Manyata Business Park and the Hilton Convention Centre the largest in North Bengaluru.

Q. How do you identify factors that shape your brand’s appeal to the ever-evolving and changing customer needs?

We closely follow our customer voice across channels including social media. We engage with customers especially before and during arrival to ensure we can personalise the stay experience. We also learn from our colleagues around various locations globally to adopt best practices from our hotels across Hilton worldwide. Last but not least we work with local stakeholders like our corporate partners MICE organisers and influencers to understand evolving market needs and trends which we then plow back into our experiences. So it is an ‘always on’ effort. For example at the Hilton Hotels Embassy Manyata Business Park Bengaluru we offer integrated Bleisure experiences for customers to experience local and select leisure offerings while on business travel. Across our dual-branded hotels and the vast convention centre that can cater from 2 to 2000 pax seamlessly we have integrated technology that allows for our guests to carry their plug-and-play lifestyle while traveling too.

Q. How is the Hilton Garden Inn shaping up in terms of bookings and overall business since the opening?

We have had a phenomenal commercial response from guests and bookers alike to the Hilton Garden Inn Bengaluru which opened in March 2022. We mainly attribute this to our optimal value pricing and friendly focused service offering. We are proud to share that we have active global event queries for the Hilton Convention Centre too in the pipeline up to 2024. The Hilton Hotels Embassy Manyata Bengaluru offers something for everyone as we can offer an excellent mixed-use product for different price points. So guests can enjoy the benefit of a full-service complex in the process which is probably the first of its kind in South India.

Q. What are the USPs of the hotels that you manage?

We are one of India’s largest hotel complexes with 619 keys across two Hotel brands: The Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn Bengaluru five food and beverage outlets and a convention centre spread across nearly 60 000 square feet housing eighteen versatile venues.

We have the largest twin bedroom inventory in the city with 262 well-appointed twin rooms making it the venue of choice for corporate and leisure events.

With proximity to the airport and easy access to train and metro stations North Bengaluru now has a great mixed-use hotel complex and convention centre.

A technology-integrated lifestyle is offered in the premise which means customers can carry and use their technology while at the hotel in a plug and play model seamlessly.

An extensive roster of talented and seasoned chefs who have traditional authentic cuisine expertise for leisure events especially luxe weddings. So celebrations can be customised to scale.

Q. Have you noticed a demand or pick-up in MICE inquiries and queries in the past few months? If yes how prepared is your hotel to capture the upcoming demand?

We have a positive outlook. We are seeing a steady trickle in inquiries for both business travel and MICE inquiries post-February as the OMICRON wave started to recede. Pent-up demand for social events is visible as people want to get back to the full-fledged big fat Indian wedding celebrations.

Our proactive commercial team is well entrenched in the market to facilitate inquiries -be it business or leisure events. We also have a strong partner network where service providers like venue stylists fleet managers and event planners work with us and execute large-scale events of 1000 guests and above. So we are genuinely invested in a culture of cooperation and will work closely with local stakeholders to cement North Bengaluru’s position as India’s newest MICE destination.

Q. Tell us about your hotel’s forte in the MICE business regarding infrastructure and facilities?

We are one of South India’s largest integrated hotel complexes with close to 60 000 square feet of convention space. The complex is located within proximity to retail and leisure facilities in North and Central Bengaluru and important commercial business districts. The hotel is conveniently located within a 40-minute drive from the Kempegowda International Airport.

With our dual hotel brands offering direct access to a versatile convention space guests can enjoy integrated cutting-edge MICE experiences in the heart of North Bengaluru. The hotel complex also offers dynamic pricing options where guests can choose a variety of accommodation options as per the desired pricing and consume all other common offerings available within the premises. The complex is one of its kind offering seamless scalability for physical and hybrid events powered by best-in-class event technology solutions. This includes an approximate 13000 square feet pillarless grand ballroom that can accommodate up to 2000 people and 18 meeting and event spaces. Our culinary brigade only strengthens our offerings further as a MICE destination as we have the talent and seasoned experience of a team of chefs with distinct specialties. We also have the largest twin bed inventory of 262 well-appointed guest rooms in the city making The Hilton Embassy Manyata Business Park an ideal venue for business and leisure events.

Q. Please throw light on the dynamics of Bengaluru city when it comes to MICE business?

Bengaluru has traditionally been home to a wide range of heavy and light industries and technology and service industries including information technology (IT) and electronics telecommunications aerospace pharmaceuticals biotechnology banking and finance and textiles. Marque events such as the Aero India International airshow have made Bengaluru home over the years. However Bengaluru has tremendous potential to become a MICE destination in its own right as it has the right mix of connectivity industry and start-up presence and key industry bodies like NASSCOM based in the city. It is a great boost to see the Government of Karnataka’s commitment toward the goal by making key provisions in the 2022-23 budget.

Q. Presently with the international connect are your hotels focused on the domestic MICE market or the international MICE market for the business?

We are focused on making the Hilton Embassy Manyata Business Park Complex the city’s best MICE address. We can seamlessly engage with our source markets and facilitate queries directly with event organisers for future queries in 2023 and beyond through our above property commercial teams. The domestic MICE market continues to pick the pace and pent-up demand flow helping us achieve topline as international travel is yet to reach pre-COVID levels. Meanwhile domestic MICE sentiments reflect a positive outlook and remain a key focus for 2022.

Q. What are your MICE business expectations from India and the international market by the end of 2022?

We expect the uptick to continue for business from India. Also we are in a position to offer a reliable alternative to destinations like Hong Kong Taiwan and Shanghai as India is open and functioning to near pre-COVID levels for the international source markets. We look forward to facilitating requirements from these markets.

Q. What are the upcoming trends and future outlook for the MICE business that you anticipate in the hospitality industry?

We anticipate that there will be a continued focus on technology and safety to address evolving customer needs such as contactless arrival and real-time communications with guests as they plan their travel. Vaccine travel lanes will become a reality for all travellers and stakeholders in the MICE business hotels will become reliable partners in ensuring vaccine travel lanes are maintained effectively. Especially as global business travel picks pace. Last but a critical trend is the scalability of hybrid events which provides for flexible event participation and evolving travel advisories in the future. This will also cement the Hub and Spoke event model that has emerged post-pandemic as a preferred MICE model that safeguards against force majeure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZG91YmxldHJlZS1ieS1oaWx0b24tbWFyaW5hLWFnYWRpctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DoubleTree by Hilton Marina Agadir Hotel & Residences to open next year,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/business/doubletree-by-hilton-marina-agadir on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZG91YmxldHJlZS1ieS1oaWx0b24tbWFyaW5hLWFnYWRpctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Home Depot saving tips

First the twins advise keeping an eye out for damaged boxes.

As long as the product inside is still in good condition Home Depot will often sell a product with a damaged box at a 10% discount.

Next they reveal that if you're having trouble with customer service cashiers are authorized to discount your sale by up to $50.

A representative from Home Depot’s corporate communications told The Sun that this is not entirely accurate as there is no set discount amount.

“While associates are empowered to take care of our customers and offer the best customer service price adjustments are on a case by case basis” they explained.

Next the twins point out that Home Depot has a competitor price match guarantee.

If any other store sells the same item Home Depot sells for a lower price Home Depot will offer you the same deal.

According to Home Depot's return policy you need to bring an ad printout or photo proving the price with you to the register to get the match.

Finally they explain Home Depot's price adjustment policy.

If you buy a product and the price drops within 30 days you're entitled to a refund matching the price reduction.

To be eligible for a price adjustment you need to hold onto your receipt or provide other proof of purchase.

You can still request a price adjustment more than 30 days after you bought a product but Home Depot is not likely to grant you a discount.

The Sun explained five more ways to save money at Home Depot.

Before that he lived half a block to the east and before that right across the street. Suffice to say the neigborhood is Bill’s home.

""It’s wonderful. You have a good stable neighborhood and I like it here"" the 71-year-old said.

Unfortunately Bill’s house is not very stable. There are numerous broken windows cracks in the siding and a roof so full of holes that Bill has had to move down to the basement.

ROB MONACO / MTN News There are multiple large cracks in the side of Bill Wagner's house at 503 Cook Avenue in Billings.

ROB MONACO / MTN News The entire roof at 503 Cook Avenue needs to be replaced.

The city’s code enforcement division keeps a Dirty Dozen list of the most problematic properties in town and this is No. 1.

""The case has been open since 2019"" said code enforcement manager Tina Hoeger. ""It did end up in court and the judge ordered an abatement.""

That means a judge gave the city power to do what they deem necessary - in this case demolish the house. But Hoeger who just joined the department in January wasn’t about to do that.

""We’re not going to take someone’s house down and create a homeless situation for this person"" she said. ""So we brainstormed. At one point I asked if he was a veteran because I know there are programs to help veterans.”

Turns out he is. Bill spent four years as a Navy aviation mechanic from 1971-75 before moving back to Montana. He’s a member of the local VA clinic but the VA can’t do much about his housing repairs. That’s where Miguel Gonzales comes in.

""We help in areas where the VA or vet center doesn’t help with"" Gonzales said.

CASEY CONLON / MTN News Tina Hoeger (left) enlisted Miguel Gonzales with Warrior Wishes Montana to apply for building material funds to fix local veteran Bill Wagner's house.

Seven years ago Gonzales - an Iraq war veteran - started Warrior Wishes Montana a non-profit designed to fill in the gaps helping vets with whatever they may need. He’d seen a case like Bill’s before.

""About six years ago we had another veteran who needed new siding on his house or he was going to get kicked out of the court he was in"" Gonzales said. ""There's a man in town named Lance who works for Home Depot. He called and told me that Home Depot had set $50 million aside to help veterans with these kinds of crises.”

The catch is they're only able to help non-profit organizations. Hoeger can’t go to the Home Depot Foundation on the city’s behalf so Gonzales makes it possible. Now all they need is someone to do the work.

""Miguel reached out to me and asked if I can lend a hand and I said no problem"" Ryan Kovach said.

Because Kovach and his partner Tim Kirby are both veterans and that’s what this brotherhood does.

""If there’s a veteran in need it hits home"" Kovach said. ""We’ve all needed some help at one point and it’s nice to know that there’s help out there.""

CASEY CONLON / MTN News Ryan Kovach a 10-year Montana National Guard veteran is donating his labor for free to do repairs on Bill Wagner's home.

Kovach and Kirby hope to start work by mid-June and are donating their labor completely free of charge and with the Home Depot Foundation covering the materials Bill gets to stay in the only place he’s ever known.

""To not have to pack up and move and throw everything out"" Wagner said fighting back tears ""it's wonderful.""

""I know this is outside the code enforcement box"" Hoeger added ""but what’s the point of doing anything if you’re not willing to help the people in your community?”

It's become a usual sight for those who frequent West 8th Street and Pine Street until earlier this week when the skeleton disappeared.

McCracken says he returned home around 3:00 a.m. Tuesday morning to find the once towering skeleton gone.



""Immediately I was like where the hell did it go"" says McCracken standing in the plot of grass the skeleton named Mr. Bones once stood.

After waking his fiance up they turn to their front door security footage. The video shows a person wearing a hood walking past the front door ripping the statue off its base and running off-camera with it. The skeleton standing in their front yard for nearly eight months was stolen while Hill was sleeping.



""I'm in a weird spot where I don't know if I want to decorate for the next thing because it took the wind out of my sails"" says McCracken.

The duo says they ""go hard"" with holiday decorating each year especially during the Halloween and Christmas months. McCracken says he was eyeing this statue for months before finally being able to snag one.



""They're like concert tickets. They sell out in minutes so he was literally checking every morning like 'okay I finally got one!' They're literally that hard to get"" says Hill.

""There's a lot of people that are like scalping them and selling them secondary market and such"" adds McCracken.

All that was left behind was one of the statue's arms with a diploma in its hand. That was the most recent decoration the pair draped it in as they have cycled through different clothes hats and glasses since those driving jogging or biking past their home every day began interacting with it during the Halloween season. That extended into Thanksgiving then Christmas then Valentine's Day then Easter then St. Patrick's Day ending most recently with the skeleton dressed in a cap and gown for graduation season.

""We had families stopping by our house wanting to take pictures with it. Then we found a Santa Claus hat for it and we're like 'well all right we're doing Christmas then too'"" says McCracken.



""People would park and they would pull their kids out of their car seats on the way home so they could like check it out up close and they would ask if they could take pictures. That was really fun. It was really fun to see that"" added Hill.

They say they purchased the 12-foot skeleton for roughly $400 at Home Depot. The product sold out immediately after. Now the couple can only find another one online for more than three times that. Amazon currently sells them for nearly $1500.



The theft didn't just dampen their spirits. Hundreds of people flooded different social media groups and platforms such as Facebook and Nextdoor with their grievances. After the large outcry the Chico Police Department took notice.

Chico Police Lieutenant Terry Tupper says a case has been opened into this theft. The most important piece of the investigation: the front door security footage. He says the video does not capture the suspect's face well but the video is circulating throughout the department as they try to determine other identifying factors of the individual.



Regardless if a suspect is ever found Hill and McCracken say it's time for Mr. Bones to come back home.

""If you could talk to the people who took it what would you tell them?"" asks KRCR.



""I will turn my back if they just want to bring it back and put it back where it was. No questions asked"" responds McCracken. ""They probably thought it was funny. Unfortunately it's not and it's making more people sad than just the two of us."""

Latin America Hotel Investors Gain Interest in International Brands

The supply of hotels affiliated with international brands across Latin America has historically been low but investors now have growing interest in conversions as more owners understand the importance of branding according to executives speaking at the recent Hotel Opportunities Latin America conference.

They always thought their brand was more important than an international brand"" said Ricardo Mader Rodrigues CEO of Colliers Market Intelligence and Advisory. ""They see now the difference of how a strong brand [and] all the benefits they bring [can make a difference].

""We're seeing a lot of owners finally understanding the value of the brand"" he said. ""It's a great moment for franchising. It's a big change and I believe that the next few years are going to see an increase of brands in the region to franchise.""

Warren Buffett isn’t known for being a technology investor.

In his 2014 letter to shareholders Buffett wrote that he prefers “simple businesses” and added that “if there’s lots of technology we won’t understand it.”

But in recent years the Oracle of Omaha has warmed up a bit to the tech space. His holding company Berkshire Hathaway started buying Apple in 2016. Now the iPhone giant is the largest public holding in its portfolio.

Just last month Berkshire revealed that it had purchased 121 million shares of PC and printer hardware company HP (HPQ) a stake worth nearly $4.7 billion at today’s prices.

Let’s quickly dig into the move and figure out if following Buffett into HP makes sense for investors.

An unexpected shopping spree

Berkshire’s cash pile grew to a near-record $146.7 billion at the end of 2021 largely because Buffett found little that excited him. He is a value investor after all and U.S. stock market valuations were bloated up until a few months ago.

But based on his company’s recent moves it's clear that Buffett now sees opportunity in the market.

In March Berkshire snapped up over 136 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY) representing nearly 15% of the integrated oil and gas giant’s total shares outstanding.

Later in the month Berkshire reached an agreement to buy insurance company Alleghany for $11.6 billion.

And now by loading up 121 million shares of HP Berkshire has become its largest shareholder with an 11.4% stake.

A fast-growing company

With a market cap of around $41 billion HP isn’t nearly as big as Buffett’s other major tech holding Apple. But it’s one of the leading players in the PC industry.

And business is not standing still.

In HP’s fiscal Q1 revenue grew 8.8% year over year to $17 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.10 up 19.6% from the year-ago period and well above management’s prior outlook.

In March HP announced that it would acquire video and voice solutions company Poly in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.3 billion. The move should accelerate HP’s growth strategy helping it build a leading portfolio of hybrid work solutions.

The company is returning cash to investors too. HP pays quarterly dividends of 25 cents per share translating to a decent annual yield of 2.6%.

It’s also buying back its shares: In fiscal Q1 HP spent $1.5 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 42.6 million shares of common stock.

Buffett loves cheap stocks

Due to growing investor interest many tech stocks have rallied significantly in recent years pushing their valuations to uncomfortably high levels.

Story continues

However HP remains relatively cheap a characteristic that Buffett loves to see in his investment purchases.

Despite the multi-year rally in tech HP has a price-to-earnings ratio of 7. That’s not only substantially lower than the S&P 500’s average P/E of 21 but also below the company’s own five-year average P/E of 10.

Given Wall Street’s positive reaction to the investment — both HP and Berkshire shares are up nicely since the announcement — following Buffett’s coattails might not be a bad idea.

“We view Berkshire buying HPQ shares as a positive that validates HPQ’s strategy/deep value” writes Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani in a note to investors.

Though that's exactly what people are seeing in Manhattan Illinois. Owner Nick and his dad found an ad for a rusty old milk truck at a swap meet and decided it was going to be the basis of the drag racer they'd always wanted to build. So they shipped it home from Seymour Connecticut and got to work immediately stripping it apart and prepping it for drag racing.

The only thing original on this old milk truck which seems to be a '50s Divco Model 374 is its patina-covered body. All of the original hand-painted logos are still on truck from the original dairy company that used it back in its day. Even the original driver's name is still painted near the front door. Everything else though was thrown out.

Nick and his dad took the body off the frame and actually built a mostly-custom ladder frame for it. The front of the frame and the front suspension are from a '95 Chevy pickup but the rest of it was custom fabricated.

Under the hood is a 496 cubic-inch Chevy big block V8 that's been twin-turbocharged to make 815 horsepower. It uses an automatic transmission with gearing meant for drag racing and its seats are from an old Dodge Caravan. It even has acacia hardwood flooring pulled from a home flooring job and speakers with a subwoofer. So despite being an 815 horsepower tin-can it actually seems pretty easy and comfortable to drive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzUvcGFnYW5pLXJldmVhbHMtdW5pcXVlLTgzMC1ocC1odWF5cmEtbmPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pagani Huayra NC,"Pagani’s latest one-off hypercar is making its first public appearance at the Motor Valley Fest 2022 this weekend in Italy.

He’s a leftist in a conservative country; an ex-rebel in a society still healing from the wounds of armed conflict; and a northerner from a middle-class family in a political system long dominated by Bogotá elites. Yet he’s within a stone’s throw of winning Colombia’s May 29 presidential election outright with a simple majority eliminating the need for a June runoff.

On paper Gustavo Petro the front-runner in Colombia’s presidential race wouldn’t seem likely to have gotten this far. He’s a leftist in a conservative country; an ex-rebel in a society still healing from the wounds of armed conflict; and a northerner from a middle-class family in a political system long dominated by Bogotá elites. Yet he’s within a stone’s throw of winning Colombia’s May 29 presidential election outright with a simple majority eliminating the need for a June runoff.

Petro’s secret? Well there are two.

The first is timing. Petro has been waiting for a moment like this for years. As a congressman senator and mayor of Bogotá he built a brand as a combative populist willing to criticize Colombia’s conservative governments for corruption inequality and human rights abuses. He tore into right-wing populist former President Álvaro Uribe who for a long while was the most powerful man in the country.

If Latin American elections as of late seem to favor sprinters—just think of Pedro Castillo who appeared out of nowhere to win Peru’s elections last year—then Petro is a marathon runner. His political rise which started with his demobilization as part of the M-19 rebel group in 1990 took decades. Even after his turbulent spell as Bogotá’s mayor—during which Petro was controversially suspended from office for several months on charges of mismanagement—Petro retained a loyal following by consistently hammering home the message that the status quo was broken. All that gave him the appeal of an outsider even as he spent years working in politics.

Yet Petro also inspired fear. When he ran for president in 2018 his second attempt at the office many worried he might try to install Venezuelan-style authoritarian socialism in Colombia. And his conservative opponents laid into that message. A majority of voters opted for his conservative rival Uribe acolyte and current President Iván Duque and Petro lost a runoff election by 12 points.

But then Colombia hit a rough patch. When the Duque government couldn’t find a way out the country entered a downward spiral. First there were the unprecedented mass protests over inequality corruption and police brutality which erupted in waves from 2019 to 2021 and in some cases turned violent. The government responded not with solutions but with brutal police crackdowns that left dozens of people dead tortured or disappeared. Then there was the pandemic and the deep economic recession that followed. The Colombian economy has yet to recoup its losses and poverty and inequality have skyrocketed. Violence in the countryside has surged in part due to Duque’s halfhearted implementation of the 2016 peace accord designed to end the country’s decades-long armed conflict with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) which Duque and his right-wing allies had opposed. Violent crime in cities also intensified after a pandemic-induced lull. By early 2022 85 percent of Colombians surveyed said they thought the country was headed in the wrong direction.

Many Colombians seem to have lost their fear of electing a leftist as long as he promises to bring change.

Now with the status quo so broken many Colombians seem to have lost their fear of electing a leftist as long as he promises to bring change. Petro holds an 18-point lead over his nearest rival and has filled plazas across the country with cheering supporters while his competitors’ campaigns have stumbled along.

The second factor behind Petro’s rise is less obvious. Despite his outsider rhetoric he has been willing this time around to get cozy with some of Colombia’s political insiders. For his third presidential run Petro has mostly left behind his bromides against a corrupt political class. Instead he has opted to work with some of its wiliest operators.

There’s Armando Benedetti Petro’s right-hand man and campaign strategist—once a die-hard Uribista and later ally to Uribe’s center-right successor Juan Manuel Santos who helped negotiate the 2016 peace deal. There’s also Roy Barreras formerly the president of a party founded by Uribe and later a Santos ally who was recently reelected to the Senate on the ticket of Petro’s party. Barreras is currently under investigation by Colombia’s Supreme Court of Justice for alleged corruption in the management of public contracts. And those are just two examples out of dozens of ex-Petro critics from Colombia’s traditional political class who have jumped on the bandwagon. Even Colombia’s second-richest man banker Jaime Gilinski is backing Petro’s campaign as one of its top financiers.

And if those sound like strange bedfellows it gets stranger. On Thursday Barreras announced at a public meeting in Cartagena that several Conservative Party members from Colombia’s Caribbean coast had given their support to the Petro campaign. While Barreras didn’t name names the meeting was attended by Conservative politicians linked to William Montes who spent over seven years in prison for ties to paramilitaries and to Enilce “The Cat” López an alleged narcotrafficker who was convicted for her own paramilitary connections.

It’s not that Petro has entirely swapped out leftists for establishment figures. His running mate Francia Márquez an Afro-Colombian lawyer and environmental activist is the consummate political outsider who would become Colombia’s first Black vice president. Instead his campaign has morphed into a strange hybrid fueled in part by idealism and in part by a chunk of the political establishment.

Petro is far from the first leftist outsider to forge pragmatic alliances with the political class to make it across the finish line. Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ran for president three times before finally winning in 2002 with the help of center-right and right-wing parties. And now he’s banking on the strategy yet again in a bid to return to office in 2023 having tapped a centrist former rival as his running mate. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador pulled off a similar move in 2018 recruiting members of a right-leaning party to join his movement. In countries where establishment politicians rule the day it makes strategic sense for lifelong outsiders to ally with insiders. It might be their only path to office.

But what Petro’s bargain would mean for his presidency should he win is an open question. Along with dialing down his anti-system rhetoric Petro has also toned down his policy proposals since he launched his latest campaign—somewhat. His platform is mostly run-of-the mill social democracy although for historically conservative Colombia that still represents a big change. Petro promises to boost investment in public services and protect small farmers to make Colombia a net food exporter. He also wants to stop exploration for oil—Colombia’s biggest export—and shift toward green energy. But to foot the bill he’s advocating plans that are sure to prove divisive. They include raising taxes on the richest 4000 Colombians; progressively taxing companies including the mining industry; and shifting money from private to public pension funds.

Besides the economy the other big issue dominating Colombia’s election is corruption. Eighty percent of Colombians surveyed believe it’s the biggest problem facing the country. Yet on corruption Petro has been remarkably quiet at least compared with the past. His platform devotes a few pages to discussing judicial reform in general terms but the topic hasn’t factored much into his messaging. On Friday just days before the election Petro discussed a bold proposal to invite the United Nations to set up an independent anti-corruption commission modeled on the now-defunct International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). He also proposed making its head Iván Velásquez a Colombian jurist who formerly led CICIG and is also famous for daring investigations into Uribe’s paramilitary allies. Petro previously said he would nominate Velásquez for attorney general.

On both the economy and corruption it’s a stretch to imagine that all of Petro’s latest allies and the country’s fragmented legislature will happily jump on board. But on the campaign trail there has been surprisingly little pushback. What exactly serves as the glue holding together Petro’s coalition remains somewhat of a mystery. Popularity is one factor and Petro’s momentum was no last-minute surprise. The candidate held a wide lead over prospective rivals as far back as two years ago and opportunists with keen political instincts such as Benedetti and Barreras have hopped teams before switching loyalties from Uribe to Santos when the latter’s star was rising. But one has to wonder what the ex-Uribistas traditional party operators and financiers such as Gilinski are expecting in return for their support. Surely it’s not free.

One possibility is that they are hoping for impunity in return for political support—and while it’s far too soon to say whether Petro would make the trade there have been concerning signs. Just weeks ago Petro’s brother was exposed meeting with politicians serving time for corruption. The candidate chalked the meeting up to a good-faith effort to heal the country’s divides and work out a “social pardon”—an idea short of legal amnesty that Petro has mentioned several times but never fully fleshed out or included in his platform. Not everyone bought it. Even so Petro did ask one of his allies most embroiled in scandal Sen.-elect Piedad Córdoba to leave her campaign until the Supreme Court could complete an investigation into alleged links to Nicolás Maduro’s regime in Venezuela and its corruption.

A Petro victory would in many ways be a historic first for Colombia which has never elected a leftist president. The big risk is that this first might be purchased at the price of letting justice slide—at least for Petro’s allies.

If Petro can’t win 50 percent of the vote outright which seems likely the race will go to a June runoff. The outcome of that race will depend very much on the candidate facing Petro. Support for the candidate of the right former Medellín Mayor Federico “Fico” Gutiérrez has hit a ceiling; continuity doesn’t seem too appealing for Colombians hungry for change. If Gutiérrez ekes his way into the second round polls have Petro winning handily.

If Petro is instead forced to face down Colombia’s other presidential front-runner the wild-card independent Rodolfo Hernández all bets are off. Hernández who blasts the political class as hopelessly corrupt is even more of an anti-establishment outsider than Petro. In contrast to the leftist front-runner he has virtually no alliances only recently publicly accepting the support of Ingrid Betancourt another ex-candidate for the presidency. In a runoff Hernández might even be able to sell the message that Petro’s alliances are proof he has been co-opted by the same political class he long struggled against.

If one thing is certain it’s that Colombians are ready to gamble on change. And there’s a candidate Petro who says he will give it to them. Time will tell if the bargain he struck to make it this far will open the door to a new beginning—or lock it shut.

People might think of Robert LeBlanc as a relative newcomer to harness racing. In fact he has had a lifetime interest and involvement in horse racing both harness and thoroughbreds for all but 10 of his 63 years on the planet. When Robert was about 10 years old his grandfather owned two cheap claimers one a standardbred the other a thoroughbred. “They weren’t very good” he says “but I loved going to Greenwood Raceway in my hometown Toronto with my grandfather to see them race. I quickly became interested in the challenge of betting on the horses. I started doing so when I was about 10 years old and I still love to bet and always make a wager on every horse in which I have an interest.”

He made a vow to himself that when and if he was in a position to own horses he would become involved in owning them.

He was born and raised in Toronto however his employment with IBM resulted in his being moved to New York City where he has lived for much of his adult life. He retired in 2017 after 37 years working for IBM. It was at that time that he decided to take the plunge of obtaining significant ownership in the sport to which he had a great interest. It has been an enjoyable and somewhat profitable journey in harness racing since then.

Although he is now retired he is very involved with his journey through a life that he has and continues to enjoy.

It was prior to the beginning of the baby race schedule at The Meadowlands when this scribe spoke with him.

Q: Robert after living in Austin which is often regarded as one of the great and growing cities in the United States you picked up and moved to Gotham – New York City. Any particular reasons?

“I suppose it’s because it’s the only New York City. There are many who regard New York as the center of our universe. On several counts I would suppose that it might be. Austin was great. My wife Cathy and I lived there for five years. It has a lot that New York does but not everything. New York is centrally located. It has great theatre restaurants sports museums — you name it. Whatever it may be it’s there or close by including our daughter. I’m near all sorts of golf courses. Golf is a game to which I suppose I am addicted. I generally play three and sometimes even four times a week. New York is a city from which so much of life flows. Of course the most important racetrack in North America The Meadowlands is just across the river from where we live. My two chief trainers Tony Alagna and Nancy Takter are stabled nearby. I get to see them and my horses as I please. I will get to see most of my babies begin their first lessons on Saturday mornings during Breakfast with the Babies.”

Q: You are one of likely relatively few owners in this sport who has hit the ground running insofar as almost immediately doing well in the sport. How did this come about?

“I think I need to correct you a little. It might seem that I’ve done well from the beginning but that has not entirely been the case. The beginning of any significant success I’ve enjoyed began with my retirement in 2017. My first venture in the sport was in 2007 when my brother Dan and I bought a Western Terror filly in Harrisburg. She wasn’t very good and we quickly sold her. The next year I bought into a Rocknroll Hanover filly with Jason Libby Cool Jazz who was okay. We got a big thrill when she finished second in the Bluegrass at The Red Mile. John Campbell drove her in that race and that was another thrill.”

Q: It is 2017. You’ve retired after 37 years at IBM. You had a lot more time on your hands. What happened then?

“I’d always wanted to become seriously involved in harness racing. What better time than then? I had retired. I had some time on my hands. I love golf but there is a limited amount of time one can spend on the golf course. I’m a big believer in analytics. The question was if I could put that belief to use in harness racing. One could say that I got lucky. To some extent I certainly did. I am also a great believer in youth. I hitched my star to a fantastic trainer Tony Alagna. I was lucky to get in with one of the best.

“My favorite time of the year is the early fall. Not only is that when a lot of the great stakes racing takes place but it is also the time when I receive the catalogs for the two major yearling sales in Lexington and Harrisburg. It’s probably difficult to quantify how much time I put into studying those ‘bibles’ but it is significant. I pick the yearlings that I am most interested in based on their bloodlines. I’m a great believer in pedigree. Without it you are destined to climb much higher mountains than you would encounter with having it. I make my picks. I then check to see what Tony and Nancy and my partners think of them. To a great extent they usually coincide. I buy into several yearlings. We try to run it on a business basis. Our goal is to develop top 2- and 3-year-olds. Those that don’t reach that status are usually sold by the beginning of their 4-year-old season. Their spots in our lineup are replaced by yearlings. We had moderate success the first two years but the best was yet to come.”

Q: What happened?

“The year was 2020. Even though I was having a pretty good season the real fireworks erupted at The Meadowlands on Aug. 8. The Hambletonian was won by our Ramona Hill. We received a little criticism for putting a filly in against the best 3-year-old trotting colts but Ramona proved our confidence by soundly winning the race. Shortly thereafter I was part of two spectacular upsets in classics races. On Sept. 22 our Captain Barbossa won the Little Brown Jug. Then only two days later Exploit won the Metro Pace at Woodbine Mohawk. What a great run that was! There are many who have been in the business all their lives who haven’t had the good fortune to win even one of those races. Here we were winning three Classics events in less than two months.”

Q: You often make reference to your partners and how big an influence they have had in your great experiences in the sport.

“All of my horses are and have been owned by partnership groups. In addition to being involved with great people. We share in the ups and downs — hopefully more of the former than the latter. The combined knowledge of such as Tony Alagna John Fodera David Anderson Myron Bell the Crawfords Brad Grant Ken Jacobs and Steve Wienick is without equal in the sport. Perhaps every bit as important as their knowledge is the fact that without exception they are all fine people who I am privileged to call my friends.”

Q: What is the makeup of the horses in training with which you have an ownership position right now?

“I presently have 15 head in training. They are made up of 10 2-year-olds — five with Tony Alagna four with Nancy Takter and one in Canada with Jason Libby — and five 3-year-olds — four with Alagna and one with Nancy. They are fairly evenly represented with trotters seven and pacers eight.”

Q: Which horse that you’ve owned would you considered to have been the best?

“Undoubtedly that would be Ramona Hill. She was absolutely wonderful. Any time you have not only a Hambletonian winner but one of the greatest trotting fillies ever — that would be exceptional.”

Q: What is your preference trotters or pacers?

“Any time you have a great horse it’s special. However trotters are more challenging. Having said that I would have to say that of the two gaits trotters have improved more than pacers. I remember way back when the Grand Circuit came to Greenwood Raceway in Toronto I would always go. A big part of the trick then was to try to determine which of the 2-year-old trotters especially the fillies would not make breaks. It was sometimes the case that half the field or more would go off running. Now especially early in the season it can be somewhat rare that any of them make breaks. I suppose that trotting hobbles probably play a part in that happening. But I believe that the biggest factor is that the trotting gait has made such great progress. They are more natural and are more adept at staying on gait regardless of how fast they are going.”

Q: You told me that you always bet on your horses. Have you been able to make any big scores?

“Betting on horses is the biggest part of what got me interested in the sport. It is certainly the major reason for our existence. I made a bet on Exploit when he won the Metro at 36-1 odds. Just last year I made a substantial wager on Queen Of Success when she won the Breeders Crown elimination over Niki Hill at 23-1. I also had the exacta.”

Q: What can we do to help get more people not involved in the sport to get more people in it?

“We need to get creative. We need to learn how to concentrate on getting people to wager on our product. The days when you get big crowds to the racetrack on ordinary race days are over. Most people myself included prefer to sit comfortably in our homes to watch and wager. Legal sports betting presents another challenge. We need to figure out a way in which we can attach ourselves to the areas where people especially young people are most interested in betting — areas linking lotteries and even major sporting events to our races. Our audience continues to shrink. We need to figure out ways to go with the trends rather than to try to compete against them.”

Q: What are you most looking forward to in the 2022 racing season?

“We have two 3-year-old trotters which we are hoping will be Hambletonian or Oaks horses. Fast As The Wind is a colt with Tony Alagna who we have great hopes for and Selfie Queen is a filly who was the fastest 2-year-old filly last year. She is being prepped by Nancy Takter. Next week the baby races will begin at The Meadowlands Gaitway Magical Acres and other venues. Some hopes will be sustained and unfortunately some dreams will be squashed. Right now they are all undefeated champions.”

As reported by The Register a Lotus 1-2-3 enthusiast called Tavis Ormandy (who is also a bug-hunter for Google Project Zero) managed to successfully port the program onto Linux which seems to be quite the feat of reverse engineering.

It’s important to stress that this isn’t an emulated program but rather the original 1990 Lotus 1-2-- for x86 Unix running natively on modern x86 Linux.

Killer application

“There are a few kinks that need to be ironed out and I need to port over my terminal driver but it is 100% usable” Tavis wrote in a blog post detailing the work. “At the moment the DOS version running under emulation looks better - but this can be fixed!”

Ormandy also developed an entirely new display driver for the program which can now be run on more than just the 80x25 window.

Lotus 1-2-3 was the first killer application of the IBM PC and was a major hit in the 1980s. It offered three key solutions: spreadsheet calculations database functionality and graphical charts. Together with dBase and WordPerfect it was considered an essential app.

However when Microsoft came out with its GUI-based products in the early 1990s such as Excel it left Lotus-1-2-3 out in the cold. Lotus was slow to respond to the disruptive new products and despite being purchased by IBM in 1995 never really recovered.

IBM continued to sell Lotus offerings only throwing in the towel in 2013. In June that year IBM announced the withdrawal of the Lotus brand including Lotus 1-2-3 Millennium Edition V9.x IBM Lotus SmartSuite 9.x V9.8.0 and Organizer V6.1.0.

""Customers will no longer be able to receive support for these offerings after 30 September 2014” the company said at the time. “No service extensions will be offered. There will be no replacement programs.""

Unable to beat AWS or the next two cloud providers (Azure and Google Cloud) IBM has joined AWS by signing a multi-year collaboration agreement. IBM will make a variety of its software available as a service on AWS Marketplace.

The deal includes joint investments to make it easier for companies to consume IBM’s offerings and integrate them with AWS. There will be integrated go-to-market developer training and software development programs for vertical markets such as travel oil and gas.

The IBM offerings on AWS will cover technologies such as AI security and sustainability. The products are built on Red Hat OpenShift Service and cloud-native apps on AWS.

Other services currently available on AWS Marketplace include IBM API Connect Db2 IBM Maximo Application Suite IBM Security ReaQta and Security Trusteer Security Verify and Watson Orchestrate.

With Arvind Krishna as CEO at IBM the big blue has set partnerships with both long-time business partners and competitors alike such as Salesforce SAP and Microsoft Azure.

The company also made open source more integral to its software strategy evidenced by the $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat.

Also IBM has doubled down on its commitment to hybrid clouds while AWS and Microsoft have battled for leadership in the public cloud market.

At the end of 2021 AWS controlled 33% of the cloud infrastructure services market with Azure owning 22% and Google Cloud with 9%. IBM — the owner of Softlayer — is fifth behind Alibaba in the low single digits according to market researcher Statistica.

According to experts IBM has failed to distinguish what its value is compared to competitors especially when targeting data scientists and developers."

The lung microbiome of patients with TB in this study were dominated by Proteobacteria Firmicutes and Actinobacteria with a relatively smaller proportion of Bacteroidetes when compared to the HIV cohort. The decrease in frequency of Bacteroidetes when compared to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes has been observed in other pulmonary disease states such as asthma36 where it is associated with severe inflammation.

As the majority of TB cases reported in South Africa occur in the context of HIV co-infection the controls selected were HIV positive with no respiratory disease. The rationale for this was the fact that HIV in itself (particularly advanced disease as in the cohort studied) effects a change on the respiratory microbiome. In a previous study HIV infection was associated with increased abundance of Streptococcus whilst there was comparatively less Flavabacterium curvibacter Rickettsia and Borellia found37. Advanced HIV infection was associated with a loss of alpha diversity and greater beta diversity37.

In previous studies on the lung microbiome in TB patients Enterobacteriaceae17 Neisseriaceae22 and Sphingomodaceae18 were also identified as dominant families. The dominance of the Burkholderiaceae family in the cohort with TB is a novel finding in this study. Burkholderia infection in the lung has been described mainly in the context of CF and chronic granulomatous lung disease where it is associated with poor clinical outcomes3638. Previous TB infection was reported in 25% (5/20) of those within the cohort with TB and there may have been underlying destructive lung disease (bronchiectasis) in some of the participants—Burkholderia has been described in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis38. The degree of immunosuppression of the patients with TB included in this study (mean CD4 count 127 cells/mm3) could be a further pre-disposing factor to explain the abundance of the genus Burkholderia but this needs to be further studied.

The Enterobacteriaceae detected in the specimens of patients with TB (Klebsiella Enterobacter Serratia and Morganella) are also commonly associated with nosocomial pneumonia39 and community-acquired pneumonia in patients with underlying lung pathology40. Lachnospiraceae was a prominent Firmicute in patients with TB. A recent publication associated the presence of this family with adverse outcomes in the critically ill41. Veilonellaceae and Prevotellaceae are anaerobic families that are found in the oral microbiota42 and when present in the lung microbiome of patients with airways disease these bacteria are associated with an increased host inflammatory response43. Veilonella was lso a dominant family in a previous study of HIV-negative patients with TB22. Enrichment of the lung microbiome with Veilonella and Prevotella is associated with increased concentrations of arachidonic acid and interleukin-17 constituting a pro-inflammatory environment43. In HIV patients with pneumonia increases in the relative abundance of Prevotella are associated with a unique metabolomic fingerprint (enriched with amino acid metabolites and monoacylglycerols) a pro-inflammatory milieu with increased IL-17A and an increased risk for mortality44.

Mycobacteria was not found on 16S rRNA sequencing of all the specimens that were culture positive for M. tuberculosis. The gold standard for diagnosis of M. tuberculosis is culturing and 16S rRNA sequencing is not routinely used for diagnosis of PTB. Cheung and colleagues (Cheung et al. 2013) found that M. tuberculosis represented a very small relative abundance in patients where it was considered a causative microorganism18. The cell walls of mycobacteria by virtue of the richness in fatty acids and waxes are resistant to some DNA extraction processes45. As the aim of the study was to describe the microbiome associated with active pulmonary TB rather than to diagnose M. tuberculosis itself DNA extraction did not include a process of mycobacterial cell wall lysis and during sequencing no primers that are specific for the genus Mycobacterium were used.

Previous studies have observed a loss of alpha diversity in lung samples from patients with advanced HIV infection46 which is why the control cohort selected for this study was HIV-positive. The CD4 count of the HIV-positive control cohort was higher than that of the TB cohort which if used as a surrogate for may indicate more advanced disease in the latter cohort (the stage of HIV has previously been found to be associated with a loss of alpha diversity in the lung microbiome)11. Active pulmonary tuberculosis in itself may cause a modest decrease in CD4 cell count47 so the difference may not be a pure reflection of the stage of HIV.

Beta diversity was different between the HIV cohort and the cohorts with respiratory disease be it Pneumonia or TB. The Jaccard analysis considers the number of species present while the Bray–Curtis considers abundance of species. There was over-representation of the Lautropia Filifactor Neisseria and Hemophilus genera in the HIV cohort. In the TB cohort the dissimilarity was driven by the over-representation of the following genera: Achromobacter Mycobacterium Acinetobacter Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas all of which are typically considered pathogenic bacteria. Lautropia has previously been isolated in the lung microbiome of children with HIV48 where it was not associated with clinical disease. Achromobacter spp. (predominant genus with the TB cohort) are frequent pathogens in healthcare-associated infections and has been associated with CF49. The study was performed in a referral hospital and many patients have frequent exposure to healthcare facilities before presentation to an Academic centre potentially exposing them to nosocomial pathogens.

The over-representation of mycobacteria in the Pneumonia cohort when compared to the HIV cohort is partially explained by the presence of M. avium intracellularae cultured in one patient. Three other patients were found to have Mycobacterium spp. but the species subtypes were not classified in this study. The mycobacteria identified by 16S rRNA sequencing in those who were culture negative for TB may therefore either represent mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis or alternatively represent patients with M. tuberculosis who were missed by conventional culture50. Culture-negative pulmonary TB can occur in the early stages of the disease51.

When the TB cohort was compared with the Pneumonia cohort no bacteria were found to be over-represented in either cohort. Lung microbiota have been correlated with specific metabolic signatures in the BAL of HIV-positive patients52. Metabolomic analysis may be useful to delineate possible functional differences in the lung microbiome in TB when compared with pneumonia in future studies.

A statistically significant difference in alpha diversity was found when BALF samples were compared between the two disease states (eight BALF specimens in the TB cohort and 20 in the Pneumonia cohort) with a relatively lower alpha diversity in patients with M. tuberculosis. This held true for both the Shannon and Inverse Simpson indices. Although the dominant phyla (Proteobacteria Firmicutes and Actinobacteria) were similar in both cohorts of patients a loss of diversity was shown in those with TB when BALF was considered. This is a significant finding as the primary target for TB is the lower airway53 which typically has low microbial biomass. BALF is superior to sputum for the detection of TB in patients with HIV and low CD4 counts53 and BALF are likely to better represent the microbiome in M. tuberculosis. The over-expression of Stenotrophomonas in the BALF of patients with TB when compared with the BALF of those with pneumonia is an interesting finding. Stenotrophomonas maltophillia is a pathogen that is well-recognized in hospital-associated infections54 but it is also emerging as a community-acquired pathogen55 which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients56. Cui and colleagues (2012) described Stenotrophamonas as a dominant constituent in the sputum microbiome of patients with PTB57. In the analysis of specimens from an explanted lung in COPD Stenotrophomonas was found in the more distal part of the lung whilst P. aeruginosa dominated the microbial composition more proximally12. The over-expression of Stenotrophomonas in the BAL of patients with active pulmonary TB and the potential networks between the two microbial species needs to be further investigated. A limitation of this study was the small sample size which limits the generalizability.

This study considered the lung microbiome of patients with TB in the context of HIV-co-infection which is particularly applicable to Sub-Saharan Africa. It was limited by the number of BALF specimens available for comparison with sputum and the signal for differences in diversity may have been stronger if more BALF specimens were available. Further research is needed to prove the significance of Bcc in the lung microbiome of patients with HIV and TB. The metabolomic signatures of the lung microbiome the importance of the virome and mycobiome as well as functional relationships between microorganism in the lung microbiome warrant further research.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The extensions remain in provisional form but will hopefully be firmed up soon. Notably missing still is VP9 and AV1 extensions for video encode/decode.

Over the past week the Intel Media Driver open-source software has begun seeing commits for enabling Vulkan decode support.Last week was initial HEVC decode using Vulkan that was ""passing all [the conformance test suite tests]."" And then just before the weekend there was Vulkan HEVC and AVC decode implemented and verified to be working correctly for Tiger Lake (TGLLP / Gen12) graphics.It's great seeing this coming and hopefully will lead to more industry support for Vulkan Video. Back when the provisional specs were published NVIDIA published a Vulkan beta driver supporting the extensions but has been slow to pick up support elsewhere. David Airlie and others have slowly been working on Vulkan Video for Intel and AMD Radeon graphics with Mesa . So it's possible we'll see Vulkan Video implementations both from Intel Media Driver and via the Mesa-based stack as well.

MiTAC becomes the first motherboard maker to list Raptor Lake-S as supported on the current-generation series.

The company lists Raptor Lake-S CPU support for its PH12ADI Mini-ITX industrial motherboard. The CPU allegedly supports up to 5200 MHz (or MT/s if you prefer) through non-EEC SO-DIMM memory. This speed is above JEDEC’s standard of 4800 MT/s which may lead us to believe that this is the lowest frequency natively supported for SO-DIMM memory on Raptor Lake.

PH12ADI Mini-ITX motherboard support for Raptor Lake-S Source: MiTAC

One should underline a fact here that we are looking at an enterprise motherboard here which is not even based on the consumer mid-range/high chipset but either a low-end H610 or enterprise Q670 instead therefore on current gen 600-series. Among many things the 700 series chipsets are expected to bring some innovations with CPU power delivery and support for higher frequency memory.

PH12ADI Mini-ITX motherboard support for Raptor Lake-S Source: MiTAC

Furthermore the PH12ADI motherboard is a Mini-ITX form factor that only supports SO-DIMM mobile memory. So would this be a confirmation of the native support for desktop U-DIMM memory on Raptor Lake? Probably not but it confirms that Raptor Lake does indeed support faster memory even on current-gen motherboards.

Both platforms will be fully PCIe Gen 5.0 and DDR5 ready but a new leaked spec sheet might hint that the red team may have a slight advantage in memory support capabilities over Intel's 13th Gen platform.

Intel & AMD Gear Up For A Brutal Fight This Fall Raptor Lake-S's DDR5-5200 Native Specs Listed May Give Ryzen 7000 The Edge

MiTAC an industrial motherboard manufacturer listed within the specifications of its PH12ADI motherboard the native memory speeds supported by the upcoming 13th Gen Intel Alder Lake Desktop CPUs. According to the manufacturer the Raptor Lake-S Desktop CPUs will be getting a boost of DDR5-5200 versus Alder Lake's DDR5-4800 native speeds. Both CPUs also support the DDR4 memory standard but moving forward Intel and AMD will focus more on the newer DDR5 standard.

Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake-S Desktop CPUs have been listed with DDR5-5200 Native memory speed support. (Image Credits: Momomo_US)

Previous reports have speculated a DDR5-5600 native speed for Intel's Raptor Lake Desktop CPU lineup but it looks like DDR5-5200 is becoming the more believable scenario. This marks an overall 8.3% increase over the existing Alder Lake native memory speeds. But will it be enough to tackle AMD's memory controller featured on the Ryzen 7000 Desktop CPUs which is said to offer native speeds as high as DDR5-5600 marking another 8% increase?

Well it looks like AMD might just end up having an advantage in the memory department based on what they have been saying so far and what we have seen leak out too. APACER revealed in a slide that the new Ryzen 7000 'Raphael' family will also feature DDR5-5200 native speeds but rumors are that the actual speeds would be much higher and rated at DDR5-5600. Furthermore AMD is being very confident regardings its EXPO (Ryzen Extended Profiles for Overclocking) technology and how it will really push DDR5 overclocking on the AM5 platform:

Our first DDR5 platform for gaming is our Raphael platform and one of the awesome things about Raphael is that we are really gonna try to make a big splash with overclocking and I'll just kinda leave it there but speeds that you maybe thought couldn't be possible maybe possible with this overclocking spec. Joseph Tao Memory Enabling Manager at AMD

Currently this is how the DDR5 platforms for 2022 are shaping up to look:

Intel Alder Lake - DDR5-4800 (Native - Confirmed)

- DDR5-4800 (Native - Confirmed) Intel Raptor Lake - DDR5-5200 (Native - Expected)

- DDR5-5200 (Native - Expected) AMD Ryzen 7000 - DDR5-5600 (Native - Expected)

So as I said earlier we are in for some really heated competition this Fall with 13th Gen Raptor Lake on Intel's side and Ryzen 7000 'Raphael' on AMD's side.

Speaking to Channel 12 news Hayman said that “a framework of agreements” was the “least bad” option for Israel at the moment.”

Hayman did not elaborate on what that would entail.

The retired general noted that Iran now had capabilities it didn’t previously have in the nuclear field though it was still some distance away from obtaining a bomb.

“The facts speak for themselves” he said of Iran’s unprecedented levels of highly enriched uranium as well as progress in other areas of nuclear research since the 2015 accord unraveled.

“In 2015 when the deal was signed we thought it was a problematic deal but the reality today is completely different from 2015” he said.

Asked about the recent assassination of a senior Iranian military commander in Tehran attributed to Israel Hayman now the managing director of the Institute for National Security Studies. said Iran is being sent a message that Unit 840 a shadowy division within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ expeditionary Quds Force poses a danger to the Iranian regime.

“Iran’s leader needs to understand that the [terror forces] he oversees that endanger the security of Israelis and others all over the world are likely to bring the conflict back home to him” he said.

On Thursday the Walla news site reported that a senior Defense Ministry official told American officials during meetings in Washington last week that the Trump administration made a mistake by withdrawing the US from the Iran nuclear deal.

Quoting unnamed Israeli and US officials the report said Brig. Gen. (Res.) Dror Shalom who heads the ministry’s Political-Military Bureau made the remarks in talks with officials at the State Department and Defense Department.

Biden officials were surprised to hear Shalom’s comments according to sources mainly due to the Israeli government’s ongoing objection to a return to the 2015 agreement.

The Israeli government has been pressuring the Biden administration not to return to the deal which US former president Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018 in a move that received enthusiastic support from then-prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

An unnamed Israeli senior official quoted in the report said Shalom’s stance has long been known. In 2018 he reportedly voiced his objections to torpedoing the deal in a meeting with Netanyahu.

The unnamed official said that Shalom shouldn’t have expressed the sentiment to US officials arguing they will use such remarks to boost their arguments for rejoining the nuclear deal.

The Defense Ministry declined to comment on the reports according to the Axios news site. “We don’t comment on discussions in closed meetings” a Defense Ministry spokesperson said.

According to the news site Foreign Ministry Deputy Director-General for Strategic Affairs Joshua Zarka was in the US at the same time and delivered the opposite message more in line with the government’s stance.

Zarka told US officials including US Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley that a nuclear deal was now out of the question as Iran had reportedly set the removal of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from the US’s foreign terrorist organizations list as a non-negotiable position.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett revealed this week that US President Joe Biden had ruled out the removal of the group from the list.

All but confirming Bennett’s claim Malley told senators at a congressional hearing on Wednesday that the US would reject “demands that go beyond the scope of the JCPOA” using the official acronym for the accord. “We are fully prepared to live with and confront that reality if that is Iran’s choice.”

Malley told the congressional panel that prospects for restoring the Iran nuclear agreement are “at best tenuous.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9tc2ktYnJpbmdzLWJjbGstb2MtcGNpZS01MC10by1pbnRlbC1iNjYwLWRkcjQtbW90aGVyYm9hcmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSI Brings BCLK OC PCIe 5.0 To Intel B660 DDR4 Motherboard,"Twitter user chi11eddog has shared photographs of an unreleased MSI motherboard. The upcoming MAG B660M Mortar Max WiFi DDR4 reportedly sports a Renesas external clock generator for driving both BCLK overclocking on non-K CPUs and PCIe 5.0 support. These two features aren't available on the existing MAG B660M Mortar WiFi DDR4.

The refreshed Intel B660 motherboard will carry the Max moniker to differentiate itself from the vanilla version. In addition the Renesas RC26008 external clock generator is an excellent addition to MSI's budget-friendly B660 motherboard. The generator will open the doors to BCLK overclocking for Intels locked 12th Generation Alder Lake processors such as the Core i5-12400. The hexa-core chip is already one of the best CPUs on the market and the opportunity to overclock it would only make it better.

Overclockers have pushed the Core i5-12400 to as high as 5.2 GHz. Only the premium motherboards such as the ASRock Z690 Aqua or the MSI MEG Z690I Unify supported BCLK overclocking on Alder Lake. It's unlikely that consumers would pick up a locked processor and pair it with a high-end Z690 motherboard or expensive DDR5 memory. Offerings like MSI's upcoming MAG B660M Mortar Max WiFi DDR4 make more sense for buyers on a budget.

Another bonus of the Renesas controller is PCIe 5.0 integration with the MAG B660M Mortar Max WiFi DDR4. It's a big plus considering the B660 chipset does not natively support the PCIe 5.0 standard and is limited to PCIe 4.0 speeds.

The photographs of MAG B660M Mortar Max WiFi DDR4 show the Renesas controller sitting right next to the primary M.2 slot on the motherboard suggesting the primary M.2 slot and primary PCIe x16 slot could be getting Gen 5 support. If true this will put the Max variant at an advantage over AMD's upcoming B650 chipset motherboards which only feature PCIe 5.0 support on the primary M.2 slot.

With the new upgrades in mind the MAG B660M Mortar Max WiFi DDR4 could be a competitive motherboard in the B660 landscape featuring BCLK overclocking Intel's non-K Alder Lake chips and PCIe Gen 5.0 support. We don't have an official MSRP now but the non-Max costs a respectable $159.99 on Newegg. If MSI keeps the Max variant around this price it would be an excellent option for budget gamers and overclockers or anyone looking for a cheap motherboard with PCIe 5.0 connectivity."

The writer is president of Queens’ College Cambridge and an adviser to Allianz and Gramercy

At a conference of investment professionals I recently attended several private equity funds argued with considerable vigour that this year’s large losses in public markets would drive even more investors their way.

They were confident that their asset class would avoid the reckoning that stocks and bonds have been exposed to this year because they were structurally immunised against disruptive changes in the investment landscape.

I fear that this may prove to be too much bravado and misplaced self-confidence. Both the real economy and the financial system have entered a phase that is uncertain and destabilising for private as well as public market investors.

As noted recently in the Financial Times by Katie Martin “adherents to the classic portfolio split — 60 per cent stocks and 40 per cent bonds — have not had it so bad in half a century”. Both equities usually dubbed as risk assets and the “risk free” alternatives of government bonds have experienced large losses this year.

In the traditional correlation between such assets if stocks sold off government bonds rose. That correlation has broken down as all these assets (understandably) suffered from worries about higher interest rates and tightening financial conditions.

While the last couple of weeks have seen some reversion to the more traditional correlation that is not without its own problems. The reason is growing worries about global growth and corporate earnings. They point to further volatility for equities which constitute the largest part of most public market portfolios.

In contrast to this year’s brutal sell-off in stocks and bonds private equity valuations have remained robust. As often pointed out by their marketers the conventionally longer holding period reduces the disruptive influence of speculative money looking to get out quickly. As does the fact that private equity investments are usually focused on single assets as opposed to indices limiting the scope for contagion.

Such factors fuel expectations of an acceleration of what already has been a considerable multiyear increase in the strategic allocation of investment flows and not just from public pension funds foundations endowments and sovereign wealth institutions. Private equity fans also expect the asset class to get a boost from ongoing efforts to make private equity more accessible for retail money.

Such optimism about the robustness of the asset class may however be excessive. Private equity valuations are updated much less regularly than for public investments. Indeed historically revaluations have tended to lag behind public markets by a minimum of six to nine months. Moreover several of the factors that have recently undermined the public markets are also worrisome for private equity.

Higher interest rates and tightening financial conditions will complicate the refinancing of leveraged take-private transactions. They make the paths back into the public markets less secure and the exit valuation less certain. They also curtail new investors’ enthusiasm for buying private equity stakes in the secondary market putting pressure both on prices and volumes.

The worsening global economic outlook is also a problem. Downturns rob companies of actual and prospective revenues leading to faster burning of cash reserves increased debt burdens relative to equity and capital erosion.

There are two additional risks that are specific to private equity in the period ahead. First that one of its often-cited structural strengths — that of illiquidity that damps unfavourable price volatility — turns into a weakness; and second that financial regulators and supervisors pay a lot more attention to conduct in private markets.

Private equity is just as likely to experience a shift in operating paradigm this year as the public markets have been undergoing — from a seller’s to a buyer’s market. Indeed both are in the process of exiting from a world of massive and predictable central bank liquidity injections that over-facilitated a seemingly endless flow of money into a smaller set of investment opportunities. What lies ahead is a world in which the cost of money will be higher and financial flows more selective as they become less ample.

With time genuinely attractive value will be restored to private and public markets. The process of doing so however is likely to be as bumpy.",,,,,,,,,

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the IFF First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.

Michael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning good afternoon and good evening everyone. Welcome to IFF’s first quarter 2024 conference call. Yesterday afternoon we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. During the call we will be making forward-looking statements about the company’s performance and outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release.

Today’s presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release that we issued yesterday. With me on the call today is our CEO Erik Fyrwald and our Executive Vice President CFO and Business Transformation Officer Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end. With that I would now like to turn the call over to Eric.

Erik Fyrwald: Well thank you Mike and hello everyone. I’m excited to join you all today to discuss our solid performance in the first quarter and what we are seeing across the business so far this year. Today we’ll focus on our financial results our outlook for the balance of the year and our increased confidence in our reiterated guidance where we now see us trending toward the upper end. Now before moving forward I want to acknowledge Glenn who today is announcing his plan to retire at the end of 2024 after three successful years with the company. During his tenure Glenn has driven multiple actions to improve our balance sheet and position the company for financial success. We’ve benefited from his experience and commitment to transformation and his ongoing leadership to position IFF to drive long term profitable market share growth.

He’s also been very helpful to me already as I’ve come on to the IFF team. Now with this announcement we have started a succession plan to evaluate internal and external candidates to succeed Glenn. The board and I are grateful for all Glenn has helped IFF accomplish and look forward to his continued leadership as we identify a successor and ensure a smooth transition. Now turning to Slide Six we are off to a good start at IFF. We achieved volume growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2022 as volumes grew mid-single digit in the first quarter of 2024 with strong contributions from scent nourish and health and biosciences. We are also encouraged by the double digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth as we not only benefited from volume growth but also from productivity gains across our businesses.

At the same time we made important progress focusing our portfolio with closing the divestiture of the cosmetics ingredients business and the announced sale of our Pharma Solutions business. We expect to complete the Pharma transaction in the first half of 2025. The proceeds from these divestitures will help further strengthen our capital structure address our deleveraging goal of three times net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA and refocus us on high growth areas of our business. With our solid performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of 2024 and now expect full year 2024 results to trend toward the high end of our previously announced guidance ranges.

It’s still early in the year and there is a lot more work to be done but we are focused on building on our momentum to energize our team and return to sustainable profitable growth. Turning to Slide Seven let me take a step back for a moment and share what I’ve learned during my first 90 days here at IFF. I’ve spent time getting to know our teams all over the world and meeting with many of our customers and I’m grateful for the productive discussions and what I’ve found is that IFF has lots of top talent and incredible innovation capabilities but we’re not yet realizing our full potential. With a new leadership perspective on our priorities and a renewed focus on execution by our executive leadership team we are getting back to basics and I’m optimistic about what we will do from here.

First we are strengthening our balance sheet and capital structure to create the flexibility we need to achieve our long term goals. My assessment is we have not consistently delivered on our financial commitments largely due to a need for more strategic and organization operating model clarity to enable us to better execute against our goals. I think we are now getting the clarity we need and have taken some decisive steps in the first quarter to help us start to realize more of our potential. We recently rightsized our quarterly dividend to align with the market and our long term cash flow generation and have made divestiture moves including cosmetics and pharma solutions to focus our portfolio and drive debt reduction. We also recently announced and are implementing our refocused IFF operating model which is now business-led supported by lean functions.

This includes the appointment Ana Paula Mendonça who has dedicated her career to the advancement of fragrance at IFF as the President of Scent. This enables Simon Herriott to focus his full attention on driving profitable growth in our health and biosciences business unit. We will also put more focus on our flavors and functional ingredients units within our nourish division. With this operating model change we have also changed the reporting structure of several of our functions including R&D operations finance and HR to go directly into our business unit presidents so they have the full end-to-end responsibility and accountability for business execution. Their goals will include delivering growth above market with a margin structure that gets us in line with or better than leading peers.

Now to make this work we have also established an operating system which is a simple set of management processes that collectively define how IFF makes decisions and creates value provides a framework for standardized processes responsibilities and metrics and defines the tools to help managers drive continuous improvement. We believe this will create greater visibility to track performance so we drive execution to deliver results in the current period in ways that strengthen us for the coming years. We are also introducing an operating philosophy based on four main pillars; number one customer focus to drive profitable market share growth; number two innovation powerhouse to create sustainable new products and other innovations customers value and do this faster; number three operational excellence to lead our relentless focus on safety quality continuous improvement and competitive cost structures and four; people people who are engaged across the organization.

We expect that our business-empowered model and operating system will enhance collaboration to profitably win with customers and by doing so deliver strong financial performance over time and while it’s still early I am pleased and encouraged by the energy and commitment of our teams all around the world. With that I’ll now pass it over to Glenn to dive deeper into our results for the first quarter. Glenn?

Glenn Richter: Thank you Eric and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Eric mentioned earlier we’re encouraged by the momentum across our business as we start the year and we are excited to continue to build on these positive early signals throughout 2024 and beyond. In the first quarter IFF generated roughly $2.9 billion in sales. On a comparable currency neutral basis. Sales increased 5% year-over-year. Our strong quarterly revenue performance was led by mid-single digit volume growth with sequential improvements across most of our businesses including scent health and biosciences and nourish. Pricing was modestly positive inclusive of FX-related pricing in emerging markets in particular the Argentine Peso where we like the industry have indexed pricing to US and or Euro exchange rates that drive pricing changes.

Absent of this benefit pricing would have been negative in the quarter largely in line with our plan. We delivered strong profitability in the quarter with adjusted operating EBITDA of $578 million. This represents a 20% increase on a comparable year-over-year basis led by volume growth and the contribution from productivity initiatives. As a result margins improved by approximately 310 basis points to nearly 20% adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Turning now to Slide Nine I’ll dive deeper into the business performance across our segments. In nourish sales increased by 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with strong double-digit growth in flavors with improvements in both volume and price and we saw very strong growth in our flavors business across nearly all markets.

Functional ingredients volume was up low single digits the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall comparable currency neutral sales declined year-over-year due to our planned pricing actions. In terms of profitability productivity gains and volume growth drove a 13% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA with solid gross margin improvements in both flavors and functional ingredients. Our health and bioscience segment had another strong quarter with both top and bottom line growth. Solid performance in our H&B portfolio led by double-digit sales growth in cultures and food enzymes animal nutrition and grain processing and mid-single digit growth in home and personal care drove a 6% increase in comparable currency neutral sales.

Improved volume and productivity gains led to a 21% increase in year-over-year comparable adjusted operating EBITDA. Scent delivered another excellent quarter including 16% growth in comparable currency neutral sales driven by double digit growth in consumer fragrance and fragrance ingredients and mid-single digit growth in fine fragrances. Segment also excelled in terms of profitability primarily led by volume growth and productivity improvements which delivered an outstanding adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 55% on a comparable basis. Lastly in pharma solutions while we saw some improvements from productivity initiatives these were offset by lower volumes driven as expected due to continued destocking trends which began late last year.

It’s worth noting that part of the destocking trend in the first quarter was market related and the other is due to Pharma Solutions initiative to reduce reliance on distributors and convert more of its core excipients business into a direct distribution model. We believe the shift to a more direct approach will enhance our customer relationships reduce supply chain complexity and provide greater access to technical resources while also improving margins. Also as mentioned we agreed to divest the Pharma Solutions business as part of our portfolio optimization efforts and are confident the business will be positioned to thrive and succeed in partnership with Roquette. Now on Slide 10 I’d like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position.

Cash flow from operations totalled $99 million this quarter while CapEx was $118 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. In the first quarter normal seasonality impacted our free cash flow results. As a reminder Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year as we make annual cash bonus payments in March. Our free cash flow position totalled negative $19 million in the quarter versus negative $48 million in the year ago period. We also paid $207 million in dividends through the end of the first quarter. Our cash and cash equivalents totalled $764 million including $32 million in assets held for sale. IFF continues to make progress in our deleveraging efforts and reduced our gross debt by almost $1 billion versus year ago for a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.4 times at quarter end.

Our trailing twelve month credit adjusted EBITDA totalled approximately $2.2 billion. Please note that the proceeds from the sale of LMC of $810 million were received in April and consequently not reflected in the quarterly results. With the announced Pharma Solutions transaction we are confident that we will achieve our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of three x following the transaction close which we expect will be completed in the first half of 2025. On Slide 11 I’d like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Based on our improved financial and operational performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year we remain cautiously optimistic about the year ahead and as Eric mentioned now expect results to trend towards the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges.

This reflects our belief that volumes will also be towards the high end of our previously announced 0% to 3% with improving trends across the majority of our portfolio. We also saw pricing increases due to FX-related pricing in emerging markets in the first quarter and therefore raised our previously announced pricing guidance to approximately 1% for the full year 2024 versus previous expectation that pricing would decline approximately 2.5%. With these foreign exchange rate changes we now expect currency will have an adverse impact of 3% to 4% versus 0% to 1% as previously expected on our sales growth which is essentially offsetting the FX pricing contribution. On the bottom line for 2024 we are now trending towards the high end of our previously announced adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.

This assumes continued improvements in volumes as well as strong productivity. While it is still early in the year volume trends are encouraging and consequently we have increased confidence in our ability to achieve our full year guidance. For the second quarter we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion driven by improved volumes with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $500 million to $525 million. I’ll now turn it back to Eric for closing remarks.

Erik Fyrwald: Thank you Glenn. Now as I shared at the top of the call my first 90 days on team IFF have been energizing as I see so much potential. We have great talent and capabilities across our global teams and our solid top and bottom line results from the first quarter show that we are building positive momentum and it’s an honor to lead IFF during this transformative time and I am encouraged by our positive start to the year and our outlook. Yet we still have a lot of work to do. As the market continues to be very competitive we are committed to bringing products and innovation that differentiate us from our peers and give customers what they need to win and in turn helps them and us drive sustainable profitable growth and with a solid start to the year I’m excited to see what we can accomplish going forward. And with that I’d like to now open it up for questions.

Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin your line is now open.

Matthew Hettwer: Thank you and good morning. This is Matthew Hettwer on for Kevin. It’s nice to see a strong start to the quarter. Eric could you give us some yeah morning. Eric could you give us some additional context and detail regarding how you’ve seen the individual businesses react to your new operating philosophy through the first 90 days?

Erik Fyrwald: Yeah thanks for the question Matthew. As you probably know I’ve been on a listening tour or a discussion tour since right after the January 11 announcement of the change. Am I joining IFF and it’s been really great to hear from our employees all around the world and our customers all around the world. And what I’ve discerned from that is that we’ve had multiple companies coming together with different operating models different philosophies and there was significant uncertainty about the organization structure and how we were going to do things. And what we’ve done is the executive leadership team has come together very nicely. I’m very proud of the team and we’ve been able to together clarify the structure and operational model that we have going forward and the four pillars that we’re focused on to drive our performance.

We’ve had town halls all around the world both live and by video. We’ve touched all our employees. We’ve spent special time with our leadership and I think we’ve gotten really clear on how we’re moving the company forward and what I love about it is I feel the engagement of our people around the world. I feel their energy growing. I think there’s great acceptance and enthusiasm for the empowered business unit model for the focus on customers. The job of all of us is to support our teams to win with customers and help us profitably grow our market share and then also drive our innovation that we’re at the core we’re an innovation company and we need to make sure that we have leading innovation that we’re bringing to our customers and it’s innovation that customers value.

And then finally that we also have healthy productivity productivity that helps us strengthen the company and invest more in growth and innovation and doing that with smart productivity things like reducing consultants reducing layers driving functional shared service centers where it makes sense using technology information technology. So my feeling is that there’s great capabilities great people in this company and the executive leadership team is coming together to try and do all we can to unleash that full potential of our people all around the world.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Nicola your line is now open.

Nicola Tang: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Firstly Eric you talked there about the changed operating model. Can you talk a little bit about portfolio and following the announcement to divest Pharma Solutions do you intend to pursue any further divestments or is that it for now. And then if I could squeeze in another one for Glenn on cash flow are you still confident in your free cash flow target of $500 million a year or $700 million on an adjusted basis? And is there potentially upside given the upward revision or the high end that you see in terms of the EBITDA guidance and could you explain what drove the increase in trade receivables in the quarter? Thanks a lot.

Erik Fyrwald: Okay I’ll start and then hand it over to Glenn. And thanks for the question Nicola or questions. So on the portfolio first of all the Pharma Solutions business will be with us for another year and we see a lot of opportunity to further strengthen the performance of Pharma Solutions over the next year and then beyond that with Roquette. But then we have the other four business units that we’re going to really focus on driving forward. Of course with Nourish both the flavors and the functional ingredients we have the scent business and we have the health and biosciences business. All our focus now is on supporting those businesses to perform well to drive profitable market share growth to drive healthy productivity to make sure that we’re bringing leading innovation and deliver the best performance we can in the second quarter full year 2024 but do it in ways that strengthen us for ’25 and beyond.

We’re also going through a strategy review process for each of the businesses and we’ll take a look at what it takes to win in each of those businesses in the coming years and what we have to do investment wise and making sure that each of the businesses has the right portfolio to win going forward. So you’ll hear more about that in the coming quarters and years but right now our focus is all on making sure we’ve got the right strategy the right capabilities in each business the right collaboration culture across businesses and are winning with customers by bringing leading innovation. Glenn?

Glenn Richter: Thanks Eric. Thanks for the question Nicola. We’re actually trending more favourable in terms of our full year outlook for free cash flow and adjusted as well. As you mentioned a combination of earnings momentum actually working capital is actually performing better than planned and we expect actually some improvement and then just some timing on taxes. We’re probably going to be closer to $600 million versus the $500 million. I would note that that also includes higher Reg-G costs related to pharma. So we gave you a $200 million number in Feb that did not include pharma for obvious reasons. The heavy lifting as Eric mentioned is the balance of this year separating systems legal entities etcetera. That’s roughly about $100 million. So on adjusted basis $900 million on a free cash flow reported basis directionally $600 million. Thanks for the question.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh your line is now open."

Advent of Artificial Intelligence has opened a multi-dimensional world transforming the functioning of various segments of national as well as international regimes. The interplay of AI with International Law Finance IPR and Defence is fast moving with unfathomable impact on growth and development.



AI opens doors to numerous opportunities in several fields. There is little doubt that the marriage of technology and finance will continue to drive significant changes for both customers and financial institutions. The idea of AI-assisted advancements in the defence sector has strengthened the military capabilities. However the potential of AI to trigger and breach privacy by effortlessly being able to extract relevant information is of a far reaching concern. Furthermore in the energy sector AI assists its human counterparts to effectively use renewable energy sources essential for sustainable development. It is imperative to point out that this comes with its own set of challenges and this is where law comes to our rescue.



Objectives



To understand the interplay of Artificial Intelligence and International Law.

To accentuate the significance of Artificial Intelligence and International law analyse their development and examine their possible interplay in the contemporary world.

To deliberate upon regulation of Artificial Intelligence to understand the challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence and further deliberate upon the need for an International regulatory framework for the same.

To evaluate compatibility in Artificial Intelligence and existing International law mechanisms.

To dissect the existing International law mechanisms treaties statues principles to accommodate Artificial Intelligence and ascertaining compatibility in Artificial Intelligence and International Law.

To analyse the concept of International Regulation of AI in the Global Financial Space as well as its importance in Governance and the Defence Sector.

To understand the contribution of AI in sustainable development.

To acknowledge the unethical use of data by private and public entities with the help of AI.

To understand AI as a new creator and competitor in the realm of intellectual property rights.

Call for Papers



Article 38 of the International Court of Justice statute mentions ""...teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations"" as one of its subsidiary sources to settle international disputes.

We hope this Conference will contribute meaningfully to the existing literature on International law and consequently enrich the way forward for international regulations and law regarding Artificial Intelligence.

3. Privacy Regulation of AI

The intersection of privacy and data protection points to broader questions of reliability in AI systems. AI has the potential to create new data protection risks not envisaged by legislation which in return results in the surfacing of new ethical concerns including encroaches on fundamental rights. With the help of AI all kinds of personal data can be used to analyse predict and influence human behaviour.

AI and threat to privacy

Regulation of AI and its deployment for surveillance

Regulation of use of AI by private entities

Regulation of AI to prevent unethical use of its by states

Challenges to data protection

4. Ecological Perspective of AI

AI is an essential tool to carry out space missions though it is coupled with legal and ethical challenges. AI has the potential to influence global efforts toward sustainability. AI can detect adapt and respond to climate and environmental change. Further AI software and smart tools have the potential to create a maintenance schedule and predict potential outages and equipment failures. Thus AI helps the energy-related sector to be more profitable and efficient.

Application of AI in biotechnology

Natural resource management and policy analysis

Role of AI in achieving sustainable development goals

AI in energy sector

Effect of socio-cultural environment in shaping human-like-intelligence

Role of environmental law

Regulation of deployment of AI

5. Intellectual Property Rights and Artificial Intelligence

AI can make prior art searches management of IP Portfolios and the entire life-cycle of an IP easier and faster and can remove the possibilities of error all by applying machine learning methods. Modern search can resolve the inherent ambiguities that plague traditional keyword searches.

The dilemma arises when AI rather than acting as an assistant does the work on its own. Though AI working on its own may not be visible today in the future this would be inevitable.

The extent of ownership and liability offered through IP rights to the innovations and creations of AI

Copyrights to the works of AI

AI as an 'Inventor' under Indian Patents Act 1970

Patentability of AI invented machines

Trademark infringement with use of AI in retail and business models

Jocelyn Moore jogged up to the stage of the main ballroom at the Park Hyatt hotel in Washington DC on Tuesday afternoon. She was late and out of breath.

Moore the former communications chief for the NFL had just returned from an impromptu chat with several leaders from the Center for Popular Democracy an advocacy group that minutes earlier had stormed the stage to interrupt a conference hosted by the National Rental Home Council a trade group that represents large owners of single-family rental homes.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Attendees sat in stunned silence as the group unfurled a banner exclaiming ""Housing for people not profit!"" while shouting demands for limits on rent increases and for better living conditions at rental properties. The protesters were quickly escorted off the stage but Moore who now leads corporate affairs for Pretium Partners a private-equity firm that owns more than 80000 single-family homes across the country didn't brush them off — she chased after them.

Moore wanted to make sure they knew they were heard and she asked that they stick around in the hotel lobby for a more thoughtful dialogue once she was done moderating her panel titled ""Doing Right By Doing Good."" The NRHC treated the protesters to lunch as they waited.

The incident and Moore's response illustrate how controversy is brewing over corporate involvement in the $4.4 trillion market for single-family rentals and how investors like Pretium are going on the offensive with their story aiming to portray themselves as landlords improving the US housing stock and providing good homes at a reasonable cost.

While the single-family-rental industry has expanded rapidly in the COVID-19 pandemic institutional investors still own less than 3% of the roughly 20 million single-family rentals in the country. Corporate landlords see plenty of room to run however and often say their market is still in its infancy.

But they're already feeling growing pains.

Over the past year companies like Pretium Tricon Residential and Invitation Homes — each of which owns tens of thousands of rental houses across the US and is eagerly buying or building more — have increasingly come under scrutiny from housing activists and tenants who accuse them of predatory business practices and of unfairly crowding out average homebuyers in a fiercely competitive market.

In Minnesota some tenants living at properties owned by HavenBrook Homes a subsidiary of Pretium began withholding their rent in an effort to force the company to address health and safety issues at their homes the Minnesota Reformer reported. In other areas of the country homeowners are trying a different tack using homeowners associations to bar companies from buying and renting out homes in their areas.

Institutional owners of single-family homes have typically preferred to operate quietly. But as the increased scrutiny makes that more difficult the industry is taking a different approach: The NRHC and its members are hiring communications strategists and ramping up lobbying to curb government regulation and spread the message that investors provide a vital service in the housing market.

""We're now publicly facing as an industry"" John Hope Bryant the founder and CEO of The Promise Homes Company told attendees during Moore's panel. Bryant was also among the NRHC representatives who met with the protesters following the conference session.

Bryant's firm said to be the largest Black-owned single-family-rental company owned 663 homes as of January. The company says it's raising capital to grow its portfolio to more than 10000 homes over the next two to four years.

""The world is paying attention now"" Bryant continued addressing a crowded room. ""You're in the only emotional asset in real estate. It's a home.""

The rise of the single-family rental lobby

Criticism of the industry often comes in waves David Howard the executive director of the NRHC told Insider. But he acknowledged that such barbs have grown more frequent over the past year.

A recent series of reports by The Charlotte Observer highlighted the growing presence of corporate landlords there. A February headline from NPR warned that ""first-time homebuyers are getting squeezed out by investors."" And in March a ""60 Minutes"" segment linked surging rents and America's housing-affordability crisis with the rise of institutional investors like Tricon whose CEO Gary Berman appeared extensively throughout the episode to push back on that narrative.

Howard said the industry needs to get better at telling its own story. To that end the NRHC is searching for a communications firm to help craft an outreach strategy Howard said. The organization which is based in Washington DC is also opening a chapter in Charlotte Howard said which would establish a presence in a market that has seen an influx of investor interest.

The NRHC has been around only since 2014 and its growth mirrors the rise of the single-family-rental industry. When it began planning its first conference in 2020 attendance was set to be about 200. But the organization was forced to move its 2020 and 2021 events online because of COVID-19.

This year however the crowd reached roughly 400 people including many of the top names in the business. The attendance was all the more impressive given that the industry's de facto gathering of its biggest players — Information Management Network's Single Family Rental Forum — was held on the same days in sunny Miami.

The biggest companies have taken it upon themselves to set the record straight in their view. Tricon which owns roughly 31000 single-family rental homes saw the ""60 Minutes"" segment as the launchpad for its strategy of educating consumers its chief operating officer Kevin Baldridge said during the opening session of the conference.

Baldridge said that guiding the ""60 Minutes"" reporter Lesley Stahl through a freshly renovated Tricon rental property was ""just the beginning"" of the company's efforts.

'We're not causing housing-affordability issues'

The business of owning and renting out homes has been around for ages. But in an industry dominated by mom-and-pop landlords big companies backed by private-equity firms and pension funds are relative newcomers.

That's changing though. In the decade-plus since the financial crisis institutional investors have poured billions of dollars into acquiring and developing single-family homes for rent. They're betting that rents will continue to rise and that demand will remain strong particularly amid a tight for-sale market that's short millions of homes.

Liliana Baiman a national organizing manager for housing justice at the Center for Popular Democracy acknowledged that institutional investors have a relatively small foothold in the industry. But she said that holding them accountable will be essential to resolving the housing crisis in the US. Over the past year the center has been organizing thousands of renters across the country under an initiative known as Renters Rising.

Corporate landlords are ""growing and they're going to keep growing"" Baiman said. ""We felt like this was an opportunity to start these conversations now.""

Institutional owners of single-family rentals argue they're far from the root cause of America's housing-affordability troubles pointing instead to chronic underbuilding in the decade following the financial crisis and to zoning and regulatory hurdles that prevent enough new housing from being built.

""We're not causing housing-affordability issues"" Baldridge said at the NRHC conference. ""It's really a lack of supply.""

Institutional owners also say they offer their residents a path to homeownership while allowing them to live in neighborhoods with good schools that might be out of their price range at the moment. It's for that reason that Howard is concerned about homeowners associations barring investors from buying homes in certain neighborhoods.

Howard said his group has worked on bills to limit that practice that lawmakers have passed in Florida Georgia and Tennessee over the past couple of years. He said NRHC is also monitoring a few other states such as North Carolina South Carolina and Indiana.

""Basically you have one group of people homeowners saying to another group of people renters 'You cannot live in this community'"" he said. ""We think that's a real slippery slope.""",,,,,,,,,

(WLUC) - On Saturday dozens of bikers gathered in Iron Mountain and rode together for an annual Memorial Day Weekend tradition.

The sound of burning engines could be heard across the area as more than 100 motorcyclists took part in the 18th annual Veterans Tribute Ride. It is an event where bikers ride together to remember those who fought for our nation.

Event Secretary Greg Blahnik said riders get satisfaction out of it while also donating to a good cause.

“We raise money for the local Legions and VFWs that don’t have the funding available” said Blahnik.

The group drove 100 miles to and from Iron River before ending at Iron Mountain’s American Legion Post 50. All money raised will benefit veteran organizations in the western U.P. and northern Wisconsin.

Army veteran Carl Aho came all the way from Gwinn to participate for the first time.

“I’ve ridden other places at other times and I don’t think I ever had a group this large at one spot” Aho said.

Before going on their full journey the group made their traditional stop at the Oscar G. Johnson Veterans Hospital. Riders waved to the present veterans and showed their appreciation.

“It’s an event our veterans look forward to every single year. It’s loud it’s busy there’s a lot of people and they don’t normally get that” said Katie Maxon the VA Chief of Voluntary Service and Public Affairs

Aho said he is already looking forward to next year’s ride.

“I will do this again as long as I’m not having to work. And since I’m retired I’m not working anymore. I’ll be back” said Aho.

A veteran himself Blahnik said this weekend is a time of remembrance.

“We lost a lot of people my second tour in Iraq” Blahnik said. “I appreciate everyone that comes out and does this. I know it’s in their hearts too.”

All of the riders are grateful for those who served our country with pride and patriotism. They plan to rev it up and pay tribute again next year.

Float a river

Arkansas has many great paddling streams in the mountain regions but there are also some great ones in the Delta and Gulf Coastal Plain.

In the Ozark mountains we recommend all of the traditional favorites including the Mulberry River Kings River the Spring River and its forks Crooked Creek and of course the Buffalo National River.

You can rent canoes kayaks and rafts from many outfitters on the Buffalo and Spring rivers. Kings River Outfitters has been in business since 1994 and we have had excellent experiences with Crooked Creek Outfitters in Yellville.

Kayaking on the White River below Bull Shoals Dam is increasingly popular. It is safe even in high water and it is a great way to beat the heat. It's also a great way to fish for trout especially if you have a foot-propelled kayak like a Hobie. Watch out for powerboats and wear a personal flotation device.

In the Ouachita Mountains the most popular and most accessible streams are the Ouachita River and Caddo River. The Ouachita River is digestible in a series of day trips from Oden to Rocky Shoals. You can also launch from Rocky Shoals or Sims and paddle to the Arkansas 27 bridge on Lake Ouachita.

Likewise you can float the Caddo River in short legs from Caddo Gap to Amity.

Anglers can catch smallmouth bass and Kentucky bass at all of these streams as well as Ozark bass long-eared sunfish and catfish.

A number of established water trails are excellent avenues for exploring remote and mysterious areas in South Arkansas. Two of our favorites are the Bayou Bartholomew Water Trail and the Wattensaw Water Trail. Others are at Arkansas Post Wattensaw Bayou and St. Francis Sunklen Lands. For information about these little known resources visit agfc.com/en/explore-outdoors/wildlife-viewing/water-trails/.

Anglers can catch largemouth bass Kentucky bass channel catfish flathead catfish and grinnel on these streams. You can even see alligators.

Catch a striper

The peak time for catching striped bass on topwater lures has passed but you can still encounter schooling stripers in the mornings at certain places at Lake Ouachita and Beaver Lake.

My favorite place for schooling stripers on Lake Ouachita is at the mouth of Crystal Springs. It's a short boat ride from Crystal Springs Recreation Area.

At Beaver Lake stripers are present in the Prairie Creek area. A large public launch area on Arkansas 12 accommodates boats and paddlecraft. A kayak is an excellent way to fish the flats and points and explore the many coves. A big striper will take a kayak on a ""Nantucket Sleigh Ride"" and give light tackle a workout.

Hike a trail

Before it gets too hot May is an excellent time to hike a trail in the Ozark and Ouachita mountains.

The Ozark Highlands Trail traverses its namesake range 164 miles from the west end of Lake Fort Smith State Park to the mouth of Richland Creek. It is the best way to see otherwise inaccessible portions of this beautiful region.

The Ouachita National Recreation Trail runs 192 miles roughly from Perryville to Talimena State Park in Oklahoma. An additional 32-mile segment extends to Pinnacle Mountain State Park near Little Rock. This trail will treat you to many scenic vistas in a relatively under-visited region. We love the view from Iron Mountain and the Caney Creek Wilderness Area is one of our favorite places on earth.

In addition to its beauty the Ozark Highlands Trail will take you through a lot of old forgotten homesteads. Remnants of stone fences and daffodil patches that denote long departed home sites give you a glimpse of hardscrabble life in an unforgiving land. Hurricane Creek Wilderness Area -- especially its Valley of Light -- and Richland Creek Wilderness Area are highlights.

If you have time you can thru-hike both trails. Otherwise you can do it on weekends in a series of day hikes or weekend hikes. The terrain is very steep rugged and rocky so it's advisable to be in good physical condition.

Water can be scarce on the Ouachita Trail. Consult a map before any extended outing to familiarize yourself with off-trail water sources. A Lifestraw is a highly portable device to safely drink from natural water sources.

A reliable trail guide is very helpful. We recommend the ""Ouachita Trail Guide"" and the ""Ozark Highlands Trail Guide"" both by Tim Ernst.

Hang gliding

Arkansas is a surprisingly popular destination for hang gliding. Updrafts from the Petit Jean River Valley make Mount Magazine an excellent place to soar with the eagles. Mount Nebo State Park is another popular site allowing you to soar over the Arkansas River Valley.

Hang gliders must check in at the park offices and show their certifications before launching.

Brent Wiertalla of Warren possessed an arsenal of skills that enabled him to carry out his missions.

But what skills can a soldier use as a civilian?

As it turns out quite a few.

Michigan employers offering apprenticeship programs have found that veterans returning home or in the case of Wiertalla 40 needing employment while serving with the Michigan Air National Guard have experience unlike any other applicants including problem-solving integrity teamwork and leadership skills.

“It’s been amazing” said Karla Trosen human resource manager for Horstman Inc. in Sterling Heights which offered Wiertalla employment and the opportunity to enroll in its mechanical engineering technician apprenticeship program.

“I wish I had the resources to connect with more veterans. He’s an A student. He’s exemplary in attendance. His quality of work is excellent and I believe once he completes this course he’s looking to become an engineer” Trosen said.

Trosen came up with the idea to create the programs for Horstman a subsidary of the RENK Group and a military defense contractor specializing in suspension products and other mobility solutions globally. Working with Macomb/St. Clair Michigan Works and Macomb Community College Hortsman is able to offer veterans and anyone else looking for a new career several apprenticeship programs including quality control technician heating and air conditioning mechanic/installer machinist and an industrial painting specialist.

“Brent served our country” said Trosen in a post introducing Wiertalla to the company. “Brent’s education combined with his military experience and training has brought additional leadership and valuable skills to the team. We are proud of Brent’s service to our country and excited to provide him with this opportunity.”

Wiertalla grew up in the Bay City area and after 10 years of active duty returned to Michigan.

“I was looking for a new challenge and I wanted to be closer to home” said Wiertalla.

As a civilian he holds a certificate in Climate Control Technology from Northwestern Tech but was working in the machine shop at Horstman when they launched an apprenticeship program and decided to apply.

“It’s a great opportunity to get more schooling that’s paid for and to learn skills directly related to the job” he said. “It’s been going pretty good. I have three classes left to complete the four year program.”

Beneficial programs

Horstman is one of many employers who have discovered the value of apprenticeship programs.

“A large number of employers across the state have been interested in shaping new apprenticeship programs” said Karen Helfrick talent specialist and apprenticeship coordinator for Macomb/St. Clair Michigan Works. “Apprenticeship programs are a time-tested way of growing and retaining the talent in your company.”

“We see 80% staff retention five years after program completion” said Helfrick who has 13 family members who earned jobs through apprenticeships and would agree that it’s a great idea for employers and job seekers.

If you want to be an actor or film maker California offers plenty of apprenticeships for that. But Michigan runs the gamut on everything else nurses aids coding software designing engineering machinist and telecommunications to name a few.

Job seekers can get help in finding an opportunity that meets their needs through the Michigan Works!

“Just come into the office and meet with a program planner. It’s a free service” Helfrick said who recently worked with a business in Chesterfield Township that has a mold maker program. “Eclipse Mold. It’s really a unique business.”

Apprenticeship programs are also supported by the state.

As recently as last week Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity (LEO) announced that Helmets to Hardhats would be given a $250000 grant to support the Michigan Construction Apprenticeship post-Military Opportunity (MiCAMO) program. The grant will help the program which has been around for several years connect at least 225 veterans to apprenticeships in Michigan’s construction industry.

“The MiCAMO Program offers active-duty and retired military veterans meaningful career opportunities in Michigan’s construction industry” Whitmer said in a news release. “To continue fixing our roads and bridges so people can go to work or drop their kids at school safely we need high-quality construction completed by highly-skilled workers. The MiCAMO Program will empower those who served land a good-paying high-skill and in-demand job and help employers fill open positions.”

Stephanie Beckhorn director of LEO’s office of employment and training said her office is continuously looking for solutions to address the skilled talent needs in Michigan and this program does that and much more.

“The program not only helps address the talent needs of one of our state’s crucial industries — construction — but it also expands high-wage opportunities for Michigan veterans” Beckhorn said.

Zaneta Adams concurred.

“Veterans represent the best of the best that our workforce has to offer” said the director of Michigan Veterans Affairs Agency. “This program is exciting because it helps veterans realize the many opportunities to gain skills and sustainable income and enables them to increase the economic footprint in their communities. Serving the community is what veterans have been trained to do.”

Everyone benefits

Construction work is not for everyone but that’s the beauty of apprenticeship programs. It gives workers an opportunity to change careers or advance them whether they are a veteran or anyone else looking to make changes in their life.

During the pandemic Horstman had to move some of its employees around which gave everyone a chance to try multiple jobs and in some cases workers requested to remain where they were.

“We had someone who came here for painting and asked if he could make a change to mechanical engineering technician” said Trosen noting that creating apprenticeship programs requires a great deal of fine management to be able to operate the work schedule but it’s worth it.”

Among those who encourage veterans to take advantage of apprenticeship programs is Sandy Bower.

“Apprentice programs are great for vets however the biggest issue I see is that they are not frequent enough” said the president and founder of Vets Returning Home a nonprofit that helps veterans in crisis.

When enrollment is only offered once or twice a year veterans may have been interested but miss the opportunity have no choice but to move in a different direction although apprenticeships through trades are often year round.

Bower said the huge shortage of skilled tradesmen has provided a great opportunity for veterans. “That is if the moon aligns with the stars and they can connect with their GI Bill benefits to be able to receive their stipend” said Bower who encounters a lot of veterans who are homeless. “They have to figure out transportation to and from school/work and then the timing thing. It is not all easy.”

A couple of people were walking the paths Friday morning at the 120-acre park which opened a year ago. A few children played at the playground and dogs swam in the ponds.

Chad Wolf director of the city's Parks and Recreation Department expects more people at the park as schools close for summer break.

""Especially around the splash pad on hot days"" he said.

People just don't know about the park said Vernon Tarver marketing and special events director for the parks department. Most residents are focusing on the renewed downtown area with restaurants art and trails he thinks.

""Right now everything new and hot is in the center of town"" he said.

Brock Chaffin of Tontitown said Friday he wants to keep the park a secret. He brings dogs Rueben and Rae to the park twice a day.

""I just let them run in the open fields"" Chaffin said of his dogs. ""It's so uncrowded in the morning. They like critter-chasing -- birds and squirrels.""

And Rae was wet from a swim in the pond.

When it's hot in the summer Rueben will just lie down at the splash pad Chaffin said.

Growing city

""It will take some time for people to get to know the park"" Tarver said. ""It has a lot to offer -- even without ball fields.""

Four adult softball fields in the southeast corner of the park were part of the original plan. Shaw Family Park was built with $10 million from the city's 2018 bond program.

Shortly after Springdale voters approved the bond issue the city had a chance to buy the building that now houses the city's Recreation Center using $2.2 million from the bond money.

Prices on Shaw and other projects also came back higher than expected said Mayor Doug Sprouse. So the city delayed construction of the ball fields.

Wolf in March told the City Council he needed more ball fields. The youth sports are growing quickly he said.

Springdale baseball fielded 80 teams this year on 20 fields. The fields also are used by girl and adult softball teams he said.

The council will consider the ball fields and improvements to other parks for the next bond issue in late 2023 Wolf said.

The city built Shaw Family Park with $10 million from the bond issue. The park was built on land bought with money from the 2012 bond program.

Sprouse said the city built the park in the northwest part of the city because leaders expected development there.

""A lot of rooftops have been added since the park started construction"" he said.

Shaw Park was in the building plan for the Cottages at the Park immediately east of the park -- and the neighborhood is quite popular Sprouse said. The subdivision includes its own pathway into the park so residents can easily access the park's amenities.

City Council in 2021 added $135000 to the Parks Department budget to hire three maintenance workers for the park and three temporary workers in the summer season to mow weed clean bathrooms and more. The council also approved about $121000 from the city's capital fund to buy equipment such as mowers weed trimmers all-terrain vehicles and a pickup.

Amenities

Katie Bellamy of Cave Springs read aloud the features of the park to her children. ""It has a splash pad and the playground and bathrooms"" she shared. ""It seems like it has some really fun stuff.""

Friday was the young family's first day at the park Katie Bellamy said. She Googled it and saw it was near their home.

She said the biking trails caught her eye because Brooks Bellamy 3 likes to ride his bike. Mom said she liked the wide paved trails -- and with a shout Brooks took off on his bike to greet a friend.

Elsie Bellamy 1 spent her time at the park in a swing.

Teresa Fogerty of Corinth Miss. also found the park on Google and visited for the first time Friday. She is in Northwest Arkansas visiting daughters in Lowell and rural Huntsville she said.

Fogerty brought her dogs Peanut and Roxie to play in the dog park.

""They thoroughly enjoyed it"" she said.

Family fun

Tarver said the Parks Department tries to steer people to the park for its other amenities.

""On a pretty day on the weekends it's pretty crowded under the pavilion for birthday parties"" he said.

Other groups have planned 3-kilometer and 5-kilometer runs in the park.

School groups also have started to use the park bringing busloads of students. But because the park is big it doesn't seem crowded Tarver said.

Shaw is the city's second biggest park. J.B. Hunt Park is the biggest with 160 acres. The Randal Tyson Recreation Complex and the C.L. ""Charlie"" and Willie George Park both have roughly 80 acres.

The department also plans free events at the park.

Representatives of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission will host a family-fun day Saturday . They will stock the pond and serve a cookout Tarver said.

The city also offers family movie nights at the city's splash pads -- June 17 and July 29 this summer at Shaw. City Church NWA provides free popcorn and slushes for the kids Tarver said.

Tarver said last summer's movies attracted 1200 people when the weather was good and about 500 when it was hot.

For the complete transcript of the earnings call please refer to the full earnings call transcript.

Positive Points

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY Financial) reported a strong quarter with a 6% increase in total revenue and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

The company experienced robust growth in its core business segment with revenue up 7% for the quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) achieved significant sales success including 11 competitive core takeaways and strong interest in new solutions like the Financial Crimes Defender.

The company's Banno Digital banking platform continues to grow now serving over 11.6 million users with approximately 200000 new users added per month.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) maintains a strong sales pipeline keeping it near an all-time high which supports ongoing optimism for future performance.

Negative Points

Despite strong sales the actual revenue recognition from these sales is expected in future years indicating a lag between sales success and financial impact.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) faces increasing competition in the financial technology space with new entrants continuously emerging.

The company noted a decrease in deconversion revenue by approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation among clients.

Increased regulatory scrutiny and changes in the banking sector could pose challenges to client operations and affect their technology spending.

Operational costs have risen including higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees which could impact profit margins if not managed effectively.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

I’m sweating. My bladder is sending out distress signals. I’ve been going full throttle for three hours and have five hours to go but I can’t slow down. Not when the stakes are so high: I’m representing my country among the best competitors on Earth sandwiched between teams from Turkey and Bulgaria. I am competing in the equivalent of an Ironman triathlon for assembling little cardboard pieces. No seriously. I’m representing Team USA at the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship.

A few months ago I didn’t know such a competition existed. But it does and these people are serious and several hundred have gathered in a small town in Spain. Team USA consists of me my wife and two teenage sons. We are at one of dozens of tables inside a hot dome. We’ve practised for a month but nothing like the jigsaw masters who have trained several hours a day for years.

A man in a blazer reads out the instructions into a microphone: we have eight hours to complete four large puzzles. Tres dos uno … puzzle! We grab one of the boxes on our table – an African safari scene. Immediately we’re at a disadvantage. Other teams have brought letter openers and knives to rip off the plastic wrapping on the box. Team USA are reduced to using our fingernails. Dammit. We dump everything out and try to snap some of the grey pieces together but they don’t fit. “I wish I’d brought a hammer” my son says. Good idea. But even that probably wouldn’t be enough.

How did I get here? Well it’s not because I’m brilliant at jigsaws. I do love puzzles but my specialities are word and logic puzzles. Then three years ago I signed up to write a book on puzzles and why I and millions of others obsess over them. The book would explore my hunch that puzzles aren’t a waste of time. They are instead a force for good. They make us better thinkers and better people – maybe even help save the world.

The first jigsaw was a map glued to a board and carved up to teach aristocratic kids which countries to colonise later

I knew I had to write a chapter on jigsaws – they are perhaps the prototypical puzzle the one that comes to mind when you say the word “puzzle”. But I wasn’t excited about it. Jigsaws were possibly my least favourite genre of puzzles. I didn’t hate them but I saw them as more of a chore than a joy more akin to loading the dishwasher than eating lemon meringue pie. I thought they lacked nuance and surprise. Well I have seen the error of my ways. I’m a jigsaw convert and evangelist.

A few months before the pandemic I began my deep-dive into jigsaws with a Google search. I discovered the first was created by a British cartographer named John Spilsbury around 1760. He glued a map to a wooden board and carved it up in order to teach aristocratic kids geography so they could know which countries to invade and colonise later. I learned that jigsaws were originally created by hand with a jigsaw hence the name.

Then far into my search results I spotted an intriguing link: the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship was taking place in Spain in about six weeks. Nearly 40 countries were represented – Brazil Bulgaria Malaysia Canada Italy and on and on. Yet oddly no Team USA. On a whim I filled out the application for the four-person team event. I figured this would be the first step in a rigorous screening process – timed trials perhaps an interview – that I would surely fail. A day later an email pinged back: “Congratulations. You are confirmed as Team USA in the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship.”

I was thrilled and horrified. I mean I know it’s not the Olympics. But still there’s pressure. It’s an international competition and I will be representing my fellow 330 million Americans. “It’s your patriotic duty” I told my reluctant teammates. They were sceptical but agreed to do it as long as there wasn’t a uniform. No problem.

I realised my family needed coaching so I called up Karen Kavett a New Jersey native with a popular YouTube channel about jigsaws. She gave us a crash course in speed-solving. Yes you should usually start with the edges – but not always it depends on how colourful the puzzle is: some experts start by sorting the colours instead assembling those then working outwards.

If you’re not sure two pieces actually fit together hold them up to the light and make sure no brightness seeps through.

Sometimes you should work backwards: visualise what’s missing and look for that piece. When confronted with a dreaded big sky or any other monochromatic expanse switch strategies and sort by shape rather than colour. Make a pile of pieces with two outies and two innies another pile with one outie and three innies and so on. This will make it easier to assemble.

We practised on weekends but felt woefully unprepared as we flew off to Valladolid a small city two hours’ drive north of Madrid. The tournament took place at the Millennium Dome a bubble-shaped structure with an indoor space the size of a minor league baseball stadium. The floor was packed with jigsaw enthusiasts hundreds of them. I saw shoulders wrists and calves adorned with jigsaw tattoos. I saw jigsaw earrings and jigsaw-patterned clothes.

My family were wearing jigsaw T-shirts too. Yes I know. I promised my kids they wouldn’t have to. But I couldn’t resist designing customised shirts for my first world championship. After much cajoling my sons and wife reluctantly put them on. The shirts featured a US flag in the shape of a jigsaw piece along with the motto “E pluribus unum pictura”. It translates as: “Out of many one picture.”

We were shown to our spot one of 86 tables (some countries have more than one team) each with a name card adorned with a flag. The Turkish team consisted of four women wearing hijabs and skirts with a jigsaw pattern. “I can’t believe it but I’ve got butterflies” my wife Julie said. She started doing stretches as if she were running a 5K. One of the Turkish puzzlers had her head down and hands cupped in prayer. I said my own secular prayer to myself: please don’t let us finish last.

Let me pause the white-knuckle action here to say that my newfound love was eerily timely. Just a few months after the tournament the pandemic shut down the world and all of a sudden jigsaws were everywhere as coveted as hand sanitiser. The Onion ran the headline “Violently Bored Americans Begin Looting Puzzle Stores”.

That didn’t happen as far as I know. But the gist was true. Facebook feeds filled up with families piecing together jigsaws of Renoirs or The Little Mermaid. Celebrities got in on it with Ellen DeGeneres posting a photo of her table covered with a 4000-piece puzzle. Factories and retailers struggled to keep up with demand. “It almost feels like a war footing” one told the New York Times. One retailer reported a quadrupling of sales.

This boom tapped into a side of jigsaws that is almost the polar opposite of speed-solving. People don’t want to solve their puzzles quickly. Speed is the enemy. They want to fill their days. I interviewed several psychologists about what drove the jigsaw boom and they talked about the mental health benefits. Jigsaws are Paxil in cardboard form. They are meditative. They take our minds off our problems. They’re an exercise in creating order out of chaos when the world seems particularly chaotic. They provide closure and certainty. They allow families to cooperate instead of squabbling. They tap into the flow state when hours pass by like minutes.

Jigsaw fans compare them to other stress-busting activities. On one podcast devoted jigsawer Hugh Jackman says that when the pieces click together it gives him the same satisfaction as popping a zit (his words not mine). I watch a Netflix series where a religious woman tries to explain sex to a naive new bride. She says sex is like a jigsaw puzzle – the pieces just fit.

During the pandemic my family and I explored the limits of puzzles. At one point I bought the world’s biggest jigsaw – a whopping 48000 pieces – thinking it would be a fun challenge. It was not. It arrived in a box the size of a small refrigerator. I told my wife we might have to move to the suburbs to make room for it.

Each night my family and I knelt on the living room floor and got to work. The puzzle featured scenes of beautiful locations around the world. We started with Santorini the Greek island. We began with the windmills and the blue church domes. We finished a couple of weeks later with the whitewashed cottages and sandy hills. Now just 23 other scenic cities to go!

And then three days into Tokyo I went online to check the latest puzzle news and saw a crushing article: Kodak had just come out with a new world’s biggest puzzle. A 51300-piecer of international landmarks such as the Taj Mahal and the Colosseum. Ugh. Even if we finished ours we would still not have completed the biggest jigsaw ever. My motivation faded. We taped Santorini to a big sheet of cardboard and stashed it in the closet where it sits today a mocking reminder of overambition. Four hundred dollars gone. Damn.

Lesson learned: mega-puzzles weren’t for us. But was there another kind of extreme jigsaw experience to be had while stuck inside? The answer was yes. And it was provided by a small company in Vermont that is iconic in the jigsaw world. Founded in 1974 Stave make beautiful hand-cut wooden jigsaws that are notable for two reasons. First they are insanely expensive from $400 (£235) to $10000 (£8200) – Bill Gates is a fan as he can afford to be. Second they are hard. Really hard. They run from challenging to nearly impossible. The founder gleefully refers to himself as Chief Tormentor.

At the two-hour mark a mini-crisis. On the carpet between our table and the Bulgarians' I spot a piece

As I was writing a book on puzzles the folks at Stave loaned me a handful of their puzzles. One weekend my teenage son and I opened one of the dark blue boxes – there’s no image on the cover to give you a clue. The pieces are tricky: edge pieces look like middle pieces. There are pieces carved in whimsical shapes such as dolphins and fishermen. There are pieces from other puzzles that don’t belong at all but are there to throw you off. There are pieces that fit in multiple ways.

At one point I laughed out loud when a piece required being flipped to the opposite side. I never thought I’d laugh at a jigsaw puzzle but there I was chuckling like a fool. My wife joined us for 20 minutes before saying she preferred the meditative joy of regular jigsaws: “I have enough frustration in my life.” The puzzle – which turned out to be an aquarium full of fish – was just the right amount of frustration for me.

Other Stave puzzles were well outside my zone. They produced far too much vexation. Olivia the Octopus considered Stave’s hardest has 10000 possible arrangements of the pieces but only one is correct (and allows the octopus to fit inside the coral reef). My niece actually left the room screaming at one point.

But the mid-level Stave puzzles? I’m a big fan. I’ve even grappled with the puzzle of how to afford them. Some solutions: you can borrow them from generous friends buy them used or try a company called Liberty which produces cheaper (though still pricey) woodcut puzzles. These helped get me through the pandemic. They kept my mind occupied and taught me life lessons such as expect the unexpected have grit be flexible in your cognition. Small differences can have outsize effects.

OK back to the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship action. Team USA is 15 minutes in and we’ve been busy sorting edges and colours. It’s become clear the monkey will be a problem – it’s the same colour as the tree. “Monkeys used to be my favourite animal” Julie says. “Don’t make me hate you monkeys!” I love that Julie once sceptical has fully committed. She’s trash-talking the puzzle.

We’re making headway on the zebras but the elephant is troublesome. He and the rhino are both grey but slightly different. This is a good life lesson I tell my sons. Life is full of subtleties different shades of grey. Nothing is black and white. No response. I tell myself it’s because they’re focused.

At the two-hour mark a mini-crisis. On the carpet between our table and the Bulgarians I spot a yellow and green piece. “Is that yours?” I ask them. “Not ours” says a Bulgarian man with a tone that implies: “Do we look like we’d make a rookie mistake like that?” I pick it up. Imagine the nightmare I just dodged – a missing piece at the end. I glance at the Bulgarians’ puzzle. They’re close to finishing only missing the lake and sky. On the other hand we are not close to finishing. In fact we are well behind every other team I can see.

At around four hours we hear a hubbub. A scrum of people around a table on the far side of the dome are chattering holding iPhones aloft to get a video. “What’s happening?” I ask a group of Canadians near our table.

“It’s the Russians. They are close to finishing.”

“Finishing a puzzle?”

“No finishing.”

As in all four puzzles.

The hive around the Russian table buzzes louder. Moments later a loud cheer. I see four women emerge from the mob. They’re in their 20s wearing T-shirts in the colours of the Russian flag. They walk to the stage to be interviewed by the man in the blazer. “Campeones del mundo!” he says. They are beaming. “That’s insane” one son says. “How’d they do that?” Someone at the next table suggests the Russians are doping. I can’t tell if he’s kidding. “Just keep working” I say.

Every five or six minutes we hear another burst of applause. The Brazilians finish. Then Japan. Then Mexico. Each is a knee to my ribs. Finally at six hours and two minutes we do it. We finish. Our first puzzle that is. My sons don’t even fight about who gets to put in the last piece which makes me proud. Julie whoops it up and applauds. Other tables join in before realising we’re only one-fourth of the way through.

Later the results are posted on a TV screen. I jostle to see it and there we are. Way down at the bottom. But not the very bottom. We beat one of the home-town Spanish teams. I don’t mind being second to last. I don’t even mind being beaten by a man from Uganda who is colour-blind but loves puzzles so much he still chose it as his hobby. A colour-blind jigsaw champion! That’s inspiring. Like Jim Abbott baseball’s one-handed pitcher. It’s humiliating yes. But we are in the mix here with the best of the world participating not spectating.

During the awards ceremony the Russian team accept their €1000 (£849) prize along with a jigsaw-shaped trophy. I approach to congratulate them and ask for an interview. “Where are you from?” I ask Irina who acts as their spokesperson as she speaks better English than the others. “Siberia.” Makes sense I think. What else is there to do in Siberia? I don’t say it out loud. I’m sure they’ve heard the same lame observation a thousand times.

“What’s your secret?”

“I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.”

Fair enough. But Irina relents and tells me one key to success: division of labour. One of them specialises in sorting colours; another edges. Yet another solves the monochromatic sections – skies oceans – by shape.

“Wait a moment please” Irina says. She goes off to a duffel bag and returns with a little stuffed animal. Their team mascot: Ivan the bear. “We want you to have this.” The world is now cut off from ordinary Russians due to Putin’s unjust war but this scene long before the invasion was a lovely moment of humanity.

As absurd as a jigsaw puzzle tournament might seem and as badly as we performed I enjoyed this experience for many reasons. I got to spend time with my kids who took a break from Nintendo Switch. I got to see people performing at peak skill even if this skill isn’t one prized by the Olympic Committee or ESPN. (I later watched a video of the Russian team solving. Their hands flew around the table so quickly I had to check to make sure the video wasn’t on double speed.)

I felt part of a community that transcends national borders. Geopolitics is a messy business. Just like many things in life the pieces don’t fit smoothly. But every bit of face-to-face interaction helps. Jigsaw diplomacy. There’s even research on how puzzles are a unifying force. The Harvard law professor and behavioural economist Cass Sunstein studied methods that would bridge the gap between liberals and conservatives. He found that one of the only activities that brought them together was jointly solving a crossword puzzle. More evidence for my thesis: puzzles can help save the world.

And most of all I felt gratitude. I’m fortunate enough to be in a position where I can enjoy mental pain. That’s a crazy luxury. It’s like marathons – our ancestors didn’t find pleasure in running 26 miles on a weekend then going out to brunch. They were too busy fleeing predators and rival tribes. Same with these puzzles. Our brains were evolved to solve problems such as “How do I eat?” but we get to use them for fitting together colourful wooden pieces. I am a lucky bastard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vcGFnZXNpeC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOS9mb3JtZXItYmFjaGVsb3JldHRlLWJlY2NhLWt1ZnJpbi1lbmdhZ2VkLXRvLXRob21hcy1qYWNvYnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former 'Bachelorette' Becca Kufrin proposes to boyfriend Thomas Jacobs,"Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)

Former “Bachelorette” star Becca Kufrin is engaged to Thomas Jacobs after less than a year of dating — and she proposed.

“In the ultimate plot twist…HE SAID YES!” Kufrin announced on Instagram Sunday.

“We’ve been keeping this secret just between us and close family & friends for a while but we’re so excited to shout it from the rooftops!” she continued.

Kufrin 32 called Jacobs 29 her “chauffeur for life and the one who makes my heart smile every single day” adding “I can’t wait to do it all with you Tommy thanks for making me the happiest gal alive. I love you to the moon & back ♥️.”

In a post of his own the real estate broker joked that his now-fiancée played the “ultimate UNO reverse card” and “power move” on him.

“You keeping me on my toes for a lifetime has a great ring to it. Cheers to forever Boops #Fiance” he added.

The newly engaged couple got a lot of love from Bachelor Nation. “Ahhh congrats you two 🤍” Serena Pitts wrote. “Love that you are doing things your way! Congrats 😘” Rachel Lindsay added. “Whaaaaa CONGRATULATIONS gf!!! So happy for you guys!!” Jojo Fletcher chimed in.

Kufrin’s engagement to Jacobs is her third. Kufrin got engaged to Arie Luyendyk Jr. after his season of The Bachelor. Kufrin then got engaged to Garrett Yrigoyen after her season of The Bachelorette.

Jacob’s Bachelor Nation journey started during Katie Thurston’s season of The Bachelorette.

Kufrin and Jacobs found love on Bachelor In Paradise season 7. The pair unfortunately broke up during the finale in October 2021. After the episode aired ABC confirmed that the pair rekindled their love off-screen.

The pair’s engagement comes after less than a year of dating. Earlier this month Kufrin revealed her proposal requirements Jacobs would have to meet before getting down on one knee.

""He knows this he needs to ask for my mother's blessing"" Becca told her co-host Michelle Young on the Bachelor Happy Hour podcast. ""He can't get down on knee until that happens.""

She added ""I've already done two very public engagements. I do not like that and I do not want that again. He's very well aware"" she said of Thomas. ""For me I've been there done that. I think that the way I look at it is people sometimes look so much into the proposal and the wedding itself and not the actual marriage.""

After the episode aired on ABC the network confirmed that the duo got back together off screen. That same month Kufrin opened up about how the brief breakup pushed them to appreciate their relationship more.

“We came back [home] and had to explore that on our own away from the cameras but in that moment [on the beach during the finale] I think that was game-changing for me” she said during an episode of the “Talking It Out With Bachelor Nation” podcast. “Because I have really never had somebody fight I would say like tooth and nail to want to keep a relationship with me.”

The Minnesota native also recalled her reunion with Jacobs adding “We chatted until like three or four in the morning some nights and just talked about any and everything. The second I saw him — because I flew back to L.A. and then drove down to San Diego — I think right away he picked me up and kissed me and then we just had unlimited time to explore what this could be.”

The vote to kill the effort was an overwhelming 359 to 43 with seven voting “present.” Democrats flocked to Mr. Johnson’s rescue with all but 39 of them voting with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.

Members of the minority party in the House have never propped up the other party’s speaker and when the last Republican to hold the post Kevin McCarthy faced a removal vote last fall Democrats voted en masse to allow the motion to move forward and then to jettison him helping lead to his historic ouster.

This time the Democratic support made the critical difference allowing Mr. Johnson who has a minuscule majority to avoid a removal vote altogether. While for weeks Ms. Greene had appeared to be on a political island in her drive to get rid of yet another G.O.P. speaker 11 Republicans ultimately voted to allow her motion to move forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21hcmpvcmllLXRheWxvci1ncmVlbmUtYm9vZWQtaG91c2Utc3BlYWtlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greene booed as Republicans turn on her over bid to oust Speaker Johnson,"They heckled her and shouted boos as she rose to speak and some hissed at her — and those were the voices from the same side of the aisle as Rep.

Greene tried to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) from leadership on Wednesday but Republicans overwhelmingly opposed her bid. And that effort proved to be the final straw for many of her GOP colleagues who have expressed a growing distaste for her antics during her three years in Congress. It even led to a rare admonishment by one of her most ardent supporters — former president Donald Trump.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOC9wb2xpdGljcy9ob3VzZS1yZWplY3RzLWdyZWVuZS1tb3Rpb24tdG8tdmFjYXRlL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L3BvbGl0aWNzL2hvdXNlLXJlamVjdHMtZ3JlZW5lLW1vdGlvbi10by12YWNhdGU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,House votes to block Greene’s effort to oust Johnson from speakership,"Washington CNN —

The House voted swiftly Wednesday evening to kill Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post.

The resounding vote in Johnson’s favor – which came with the help of Democrats – brings to an end the most serious challenge to the speakership the Louisiana Republican has faced at least for now.

As he navigates a razor-thin majority the failed ouster effort gives Johnson the opportunity to argue it is time to move on to other issues though support from Democrats may open him up to more criticism from his right flank.

Johnson spoke briefly with reporters following the vote calling Greene’s campaign against him “misguided” and thanking colleagues for a “show of confidence” in his leadership.

“I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence for my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort” he said. “I’ve made clear here every day I intend to do my job I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing which I was elected to do. And I’ll let the chips fall where they may.”

Greene had dangled the threat of triggering a vote against the speaker for weeks a push that reopened bitter divisions within the House GOP conference as many members opposed ousting Johnson.

Johnson was elected speaker last year after conservative hardliners voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy a historic and unprecedented vote that sparked a tumultuous period of infighting as Republicans struggled to unify around a new leader before eventually coalescing around the Louisiana Republican.

The House on Wednesday voted to table – or kill – Greene’s push to remove Johnson by a tally of 359 to 43. Eleven Republicans voted against tabling.

In the wake of Johnson’s push to pass a major foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives House Democratic leadership had announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table.

On Wednesday evening Greene did not rule out forcing another vote against Johnson in the future and suggested that a statement from former President Donald Trump on Truth Social supports the potential for a motion to vacate at some point – despite the fact that he urged members to vote to kill her resolution.

Pressed by CNN’s Manu Raju on whether she would trigger a vote again this Congress Greene did not answer directly but said she is “thankful” for Trump’s support and pointed to the fact that he said on Truth Social that “at some point” Republicans may be in a position of voting on a motion to vacate.

“He also said in that statement that we may have to vacate and that’s something that I think people need to pay attention to” Greene said.

Asked whether she believes Trump was wrong to urge members to vote to table the congresswoman said “I stand with President Trump. I support President Trump. I’ve talked to him every day about this.”

House Republicans caught off guard

Greene and Johnson – as well as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky – met over several days earlier this week where Greene outlined her concerns with Johnson’s leadership and her priorities. The House was on the verge of recessing for the week when Greene pulled up her motion to vacate the chair which started a two-legislative-day clock for GOP leaders to hold a vote on her measure.

House Republicans were completely caught off guard by Greene’s decision to trigger her motion multiple Republican sources told CNN. GOP leadership did not see this coming and thought after the two productive meetings between Johnson and Greene that there was at least more time before any next steps were taken the sources added.

“I was shocked” GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia told CNN.

CNN’s Haley Talbot contributed to this report.

Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. and Thomas Massie R-Ky. to force a House-wide vote on Speaker Mike Johnson's R-La. ouster.

Greene appeared to catch most congressional watchers by surprise when she moved to force a vote on her motion to vacate the chair the procedural move that would allow for the vote. She noticed her resolution as ""privileged"" meaning House leaders had two legislative days to take it up.

But her bluff was called immediately when House Majority Leader Steve Scalise R-La. rose to call for a vote on tabling Greene's motion — which effectively kills it before the vote on Johnson's ouster itself.

Johnson got overwhelming Democratic and Republican support for the table vote which passed 359 to 43 averting a vote on her motion. Just 11 Republicans voted against tabling the measure along with 32 Democrats.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON

On the Republican side Johnson won the support of 196 members while 163 Democrats also voted to shield him.

The House GOP side of the chamber erupted in cheers when her move was squashed.

""I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort. That is certainly what it was"" Johnson told reporters after the vote. ""I've said from the beginning and I've made clear here every day I intend to do my job. I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing which is what I was elected to do. And I'll let the chips fall where they may.""

Greene declined to say if she planned to force another vote but accused Johnson of being aligned with Democrats after they helped save his job.

""That's not something that I've said"" she said when asked if she would try a repeat. ""I think today it has proven the uniparty is alive as well. And the Democrats now control Speaker Johnson. That was something that everybody suspected all along. They just voted to save him. And I think that's the message.""

Greene has been threatening to force a vote on taking Johnson's gavel since late March in protest of his handling of government funding and foreign aid.

Her resolution known as a motion to vacate the chair will now have to be voted on or tabled after Greene noticed it as ""privileged"" on Wednesday night — meaning House leaders have two legislative days to take it up.

The Republican side of the House chamber erupted in boos as Greene listed off her gripes against Johnson prompting Democrat Rep. Steve Cohen D-Tenn. to shout ""The House is not in order — and is about to fall into chaos"" prompting some sparse laughs from their side of the chamber.

The vote is expected to be close but ultimately fail with both Republicans and Democrats voicing opposition to a move that would effectively paralyze Congress until a new speaker is found.

The vote is a culmination of six months' worth of frustration from the most right-wing conservatives in Johnson's conference who have felt sidelined by him on nearly all critical legislation including foreign aid and government funding during which they demanded he leverage a government shutdown to force the Democrats who controlled the Senate and White House to pass Republican policies.

HOUSE DEMS SAY THEY’LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON

Greene's push got two more backers in Reps. Thomas Massie R-Ky. and Paul Gosar R-Ariz. after Johnson ushered a foreign aid bill along bipartisan lines that includes $61 billion for Ukraine.

But it's largely fallen flat among the House GOP where even Johnson's critics have shown little appetite for going through another three weeks of chaos like what followed the ouster of ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. in October — particularly six months out from an election.

With just a razor-thin majority of two seats it would take little dissent for Johnson to lose the top House job if it fell along party lines. Eight House Republicans had voted with all Democrats to oust McCarthy in early October.

Unlike McCarthy's case however House Democrats have pledged to come to Johnson's aid by voting to table the resolution if it came up — a vote to table a measure which essentially kills it is a procedural hurdle that allows Democrats to block Johnson's ouster without having to actually vote on whether to fire him.

Johnson's critics seized on the left-wing support as evidence that the Louisiana Republican was not representing the interests of his own party.

""The entire Democrat Party is lining up behind Mike Johnson. First it was the entire leadership team for the Democrats. Now Nancy Pelosi who impeached President Trump TWICE has given Johnson her seal of approval. What deal has been made??"" Greene wrote on X on Monday along with a video of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. backing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' decision to help Johnson.

The move could save Johnson's job but could also cost him some Republican support.

""All portions of the project have begun in some manner but it will be a while before any portion is totally complete"" said David Hook facilities development manager.

The work includes replacing fluorescent lights with LED improving building envelopes and installing energy management control systems and heating ventilation and air conditioning units. Building envelopes are the components of buildings that create a thermal barrier between the interior and exterior.

Work on the lighting and building envelope improvements has been done in multiple buildings and should be complete within a few months Hook said.

The City Council hired Johnson Controls of Little Rock last year to do an energy audit of city facilities. The company recommended an energy savings project and solar panels.

The council approved the energy savings project at an Oct. 26 meeting and the solar panel project at a Nov. 4 meeting.

The solar array project will be the largest publicly owned solar facility in Arkansas according to a news release from Johnson Controls.

Once complete the projects will make Rogers one of the first cities in the state to use 100% renewable energy to power its municipal facilities.

The next phase of the projects to cross the finish line will be the heating ventilation and air conditioning upgrades according to Hook.

""The HVAC units have been ordered but it will be around August before they start arriving on the various sites"" he said. ""Some of those units will likely not arrive and be installed until late this year due to supply issues.""

""New wiring has been installed in all facilities for the controls system but the controllers themselves will not be installed until the HVAC improvements are complete"" he said.

Though the paperwork process has begun for the solar portion of the project it won't be complete for another nine to 12 months due to the approval procedure through the state and utility companies according to Hook.

SOLAR SAVINGS

The solar arrays totaling 4.6 megawatts will be installed at the city recycling center Fire Station No. 8 and on a covered parking lot at the Police Department.

A megawatt is a unit measuring electrical power that is equal to one million watts. One megawatt of solar can power an average of about 110 homes annually in Arkansas according to the Solar Energy Industries Association a national nonprofit trade association for the industry.

Rogers' solar equipment has a guaranteed life of 30 years according to the release from Johnson Controls.

The panels are predicted to generate more than 157 million kilowatt hours of electricity a value of over $15 million in utility operations and maintenance savings according to the release.

The projects are being paid out of the city's reserves.

The city has paid $4.5 million to date of the almost $18 million contract for the projects Finance Director Casey Wilhelm said.

Money set aside for the projects totaled $18.5 million though the contract was less she said.

The city used $1.3 million of a 2018 bond issue which included building improvements to the heating ventilation and air conditioning system at the Police Department to cover new HVAC units Wilhelm said. She said the city rounded up on its request to the council to cover any unforeseen costs.

Appropriations not used would go back to the city's general fund reserves she said.

At an interest rate around 2.2% and payback over 20 years the city would save about $1 million in interest by self-financing the energy savings project and $3 million in interest by self-financing the solar project according to Wilhelm.

Johnson Controls has guaranteed both projects will pay for themselves in 20 years agreeing to pay the difference if the improvements don't meet the numbers the company has set.

As a result of the project the city's energy bills will be lowered by 1 watt of energy for every watt of electricity generated Hook said in November.

Other cities have generated 15% to 40% more electricity than expected and realized even more savings Hook said at the time.

There's potential financial benefit but the primary benefit will be becoming energy neutral Masonis said.

""We're very happy to be part of the beginning of this movement in Arkansas"" he said.

OTHER CITIES

Almost 90% of renewable energy transactions by local governments in the United States have been solar energy deals though wind projects have shown a far greater capacity according to the American Cities Climate Challenge an initiative launched by Bloomberg Philanthropies to track lowered carbon emissions. Wind projects average a capacity of 72 megawatts per project over three times the average solar project capacity.

Access to steady wind is rare in most cities with exceptions in the Southwest and Midwest regions according to the initiative.

Rogers is not alone in efforts to transition Northwest Arkansas and the surrounding region to renewable energy for public properties. It also isn't alone in using solar energy.

Clarksville was the first Arkansas city to run its government operations with 100% clean energy according to Barry Sellers business development director of Clarksville Connected Utilities.

The municipally-owned utility receives enough power from two solar farms owned and operated by Scenic Hill Solar to offset city operations. The solar arrays were built in 2017 and 2019 according to the utility's website.

The utility's power supply is largely generated through renewable hydroelectric and wind sources though the utility also gets power from some traditional fossil fuel plants Sellers said.

Clarksville has about 9476 people according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Fayetteville's two wastewater treatment plants have run on solar energy since 2019.

Solar arrays at the two plants each 5 megawatts generate enough energy to support about two-thirds of the city's municipal operations according to Peter Nierengarten city environmental director.

Today's Power Inc. a subsidiary of the Arkansas Electric Cooperatives owns 99% of the solar energy systems while the city owns 1% and the land he said. Ozarks Electric Cooperative is also a part of the trilateral power purchase agreement.

Each plant also has its own battery storage system according to Nierengarten.

Solar power purchase agreements like Fayetteville's allow cities to take advantage of a federal tax credit for solar energy systems on residential and commercial properties lowering the cost of a solar array he said.

The deal allowed the city to lock in the purchase price of generated electricity for 20 years he said. As the retail electric rate has risen during the last few years the city is saving even more than originally planned. Nierengarten said the city saved $400000 last year due to the solar arrays -- about $250000 more than expected.

The total savings through the 20-year agreement was expected to be $6 million.

Fayetteville adopted an energy action plan in 2019 setting a goal to transition municipal operations to 100% renewable energy by 2030. The city might reach that goal a little earlier than expected according to Nierengarten.

Springdale converted its Recreation Center and some of its fire stations to solar power in June.

Expected to save an estimated $24000 a year officials signed an agreement with Ozarks Electric Cooperative to provide the city with power for 20 years from a solar park north of Lincoln. Today's Power built operates and maintains the farm.

The city also approved in February the sale of $10.2 million in bonds to finance a solar project with Today's Power Ozarks Electric and the Springdale School District.

The project involved installing a 2.4-megawatt solar array and 6.9 megawatts of battery storage on school-owned property near Sonora Middle School.

Today's Power expects the project to generate 4.8 million kilowatt hours per year offsetting about 95% of the total energy consumed by the Tyson School of Innovation and Sonora Middle and Sonora Elementary schools according to a company news release.

The project will save the district more than $2 million over the next 25 years according to Derrick Redfearn vice president of member relations for Ozarks Electric.

""The savings is recovered through a fixed power purchase agreement directly with TPI over that time frame"" he said.

Redfearn said the battery storage will lower energy generation requirements during peak periods possibly saving Ozarks Electric members over $1.8 million over the next 25 years.

""The project is currently still in construction with just a few more steps that need to be completed"" he said.

Bentonville unlike Rogers has its own electric utility and buys power from Southwestern Electric Power Co. according to Travis Matlock the city's electric utilities director.

Matlock said the city's purchase agreement with the company will run through the end of 2032. The agreement prohibits the city from installing its own power-generating facilities.

""The city cannot own operate or participate in a large-scale solar project"" Matlock said. ""It doesn't mean we cannot put solar on individual buildings.""

Concerning renewable energy Bentonville has an 18-megawatt allotment of hydroelectric power from the Grand River Dam Authority in Oklahoma he said.

Fort Smith is currently undergoing an energy audit of municipal operations with Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. according to Shari Cooper city communications manager.

Cooper said the city entered into an agreement last fall with OG&E to purchase electricity generated from a solar farm in Branch. The city expects to save $47000 a year from the deal she said.

Occupation: Eco-system and strategic accounts director EMEALA Johnson Controls

Background: The company recently opened the OpenBlue Innovation Centre at its global headquarters in Cork dedicated to research and development into sustainability solutions.





Johnson Controls is spearheading sustainability and innovation at its global headquarters in Cork through the recent opening of the company’s new OpenBlue Innovation Centre.

Dedicated to research and development into sustainability solutions the technology will assist customers deliver decarbonisation and renewable energy goals while optimising building performance.

The centre at One Albert Quay aims to create a future-ready built environment for both local and global customers and is part of an international network of OpenBlue Innovation Centres.

Serving as its regional centre of excellence to showcase the latest innovative solutions in a live environment it is fitted with a suite of connected solutions designed for operational energy efficiency occupant comfort and sustainability.

It also features AI-powered service solutions such as remote diagnostics predictive maintenance compliance monitoring and advanced risk assessments. OpenBlue is geared to serve a variety of industries including workplaces hospitals schools campuses stadiums and enterprises.

Research and development

Research and development grants through IDA Ireland will support engineering activities at the centre including developing a professional services hub for the Europe Middle East Africa and Latin America region over a two-year period.

Johnson Controls' research and development presence has grown substantially in recent years and will see an expected 18 new research and development roles created in addition to 40 roles already in place.

Research and development will focus on the global priority to reduce carbon emissions in the building sector which accounts for up to 40 percent of global annual CO2 emissions — making it a key focus area in the pursuit of a net zero world.

“In addition to helping our customers achieve Net Zero Johnson Controls is continuing to take significant steps to further improve our own environmental impacts” explains Debbie Power Johnson Controls Eco-System & Strategic Accounts Director EMEALA.

In January 2021 the company announced a new set of ambitious sustainability commitments including science-based targets across its operational and product-based emissions and a Net Zero carbon pledge for Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

“We intend to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 55 percent and our Scope 3 emissions related to our customers’ use of our products by 16% in absolute terms by 2030 relative to a 2017 baseline along with actions supporting emissions reductions in our supply chain.”

She adds that the company’s Scope 1 and 2 targets are consistent with the reductions required to restrict warming to 1.5°C the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.

We are moving quickly to act on our sustainability commitments even while we reduce our footprint beyond the 70 percent reduction in both greenhouse gas intensity and energy intensity that we have already achieved since 2002

The OpenBlue Centre is effectively a culmination of the work carried out at One Albert Quay in its position as the data source for Johnson Controls innovative output. Data is collected and analysed to obtain qualitative and quantitative understanding of the interactions among technology well-being and indoor environments. The intelligence generated is employed to create evidence-backed solutions for healthier safer connected indoor spaces.

“What people coming into the centre will experience is the output from the use of the building which entails occupancy — using the lifts the meeting rooms the restaurant — and determining the optimum number for that given space. Under the sustainability theme we focus on the use of energy and how peoples’ interaction is impacting on that usage.”

Safety and security

The third aspect concerns security around access controls and the safety of persons within the building. “This centre at One Albert Quay will be the first of nine OpenBlue Centres across the globe a space to bring our customers and partners to experience the whole sustainability topic in one closed environment area.

""The fact that much of the innovation on display has been developed here in Cork speaks to the talent and expertise of the expert group of engineers and scientists here and certainly stands as a reflection of the very important work being done here. This in turn feeds into the Cork economy while also drawing from the UCC and MTU graduate pool.”

Johnson Controls currently has a workforce of 400 with the prospect of continued growth a realistic proposition into the future.

Building on a 135-year history of innovation the company continues to deliver a future blueprint for industries in the healthcare and educational sectors in addition to data centers airports stadiums and manufacturing.

Across a team of 100000 in over 150 countries Johnson Controls offers a global portfolio of building technology software and service solutions. Throughout its development the OpenBlue Innovation Centre has benefited from a constant collaborative input from clients and partners in advance of its opening.

“Getting the input from the end user and customer in advance has been a key aspect in the collaborative process of Open Blue — to create and design the environment to flow in the way we would want a visit to actually work"" Debbie says.

""It is about determining what a visitor coming here actually wants — what are the challenges they are currently experiencing from a sustainability perspective or targeting towards Net Zero for their organisation. It is about planning out the day and how we can deliver on the goals and aspirations they have coming in.”

Debbie stresses the importance of Government support via the IDA as an additional key foundation in the development of OpenBlue: “We are in fact the only OpenBlue Innovation Centre in our region — Europe Middle East Africa Latin America - a very large geographical area which will be covered from here in Cork. The IDA support was phenomenal in helping make it all happen.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlY29yZGNvdXJpZXIuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9tYXkvMjgvcmVzaWRlbnRzLW1lZXQtcGFpbnRlZC1yb2NrLW1pbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Residents meet on Painted Rock Mine | Serving Minden-Gardnerville and Carson Valley,"Go

od Morning Johnson Laners

On May 22 an impromptu meeting regarding the Painted Rock Mine Project was held at Toni Court roundabout.

Approximately 40 members of the community met to discuss the effect the project would have on the Johnson Lane community. If you are unfamiliar with the project please go to www.protect-johnson-lane--stop-gravel-pit.com. In a quick summary this project would create a gravel quarry located off Sunrise Pass Road where the famed Painted Rock sets on the left of the road.

The parcel is owned by a trustee and is managed under the authority of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The trustee has entered into an agreement with Knox Excavation to mine the parcel for the next 35-40 years.

The group meeting at Toni Court Roundabout is adamantly opposed to the route that has been proposed by Knox Excavation in their Environment Assessment. One of the eye-opening statements I gathered from the meeting was that the majority of the trucks hauling the gravel may not be operated or controlled by Knox Excavation. Knox will operate the site; the haulers will not be subject to any controls set down by Knox Excavation.

Many of the residents brought up several points of contention regarding the Environmental Assessment. One concerned the noise level where the assessment indicates the noise of a heavy truck is just 1.5 decibels over that of a regular large semi-truck. A.J. brought up the fact that it doesn’t address the reality of the frequency of 170 trucks accumulated over the span of 12 hours which is the issue not the singular noise of one truck. Public safety is seen as a key issue by the residents; but saw little if any mitigation in the Environmental Assessment. The BIA is only looking at the site itself and not the route and impact it would have on the community. A.J. spoke to the school district about the school bus stops along the route. After many attempts the answer received was that the district would simply move the bus stops off Johnson Lane. Additionally it was expressed that another safety concern is the mix of heavy trucks with recreational vehicles such as dirt bikes and side by sides operating in the BLM. It is very likely that such an accident would result in a fatality.

Several other concerns were presented including the damage to the Johnson Lane roadway and the intersection at 395 which was not designed considering large heavy trucks accessing the acceleration lane. There have been several fatalities along 395 recently and it is feared that 170 trucks per day will exponentially increase the dangers of vehicles navigating that intersection. Ron Conway spoke at the BOCC meeting regarding the designations of Johnson Lane as a collector road. Mr. Conway stated Johnson Lane between Fremont and the entrance to the BLM “is not classified by the State whatsoever.” Moreover he indicated the Board has the authority to limit the weight and access along that section of the route. He gave numerous examples of other roads in the county that do in fact have such limits. Additionally there was a large concern that home values would be negatively impacted by the quarry operation. This would especially be true of the homeowners located directly on Johnson Lane and near the mining operation.

The meeting lasted nearly 2 two hours. Thankfully there were cookies brownies and iced tea. The question is what comes next? The public comment ends 11:59 p.m. May 31. If you should see this article please go to the website http://paintedrockmineea.com/contact-us and leave your comment. Please be sensible and not emotional.

One plan of action would be to seek the assistance of a law firm to bring a suit to demand the route be changed out of our residential area.

Residents are up in arms about the fact that the county doesn’t believe they can do anything to stop the truck route through Johnson Lane.

I didn’t hear anyone state anything derogatory or racist towards the trustees themselves. The residents want the route changed away from Johnson Lane and are not trying to stop the operation of the site itself. The EA has stated that the establishment of alternate routes are not economically feasible for the applicant. In the County’s reply to the BIA they are asking for an alternative route to be established. It is not incumbent upon the residents of the Johnson Lane community residents of the county or the county itself to make this business venture economically feasible.

What can you do? Go to the Painted Rock Website and provide your comments. Additionally email the county staff and Commissioners and contact Congressional representatives to communicate your concerns and issues with the routing of this project.

The faction's chosen candidate for chair of the party's national committee Angela McArdle won on the first round of balloting with 692 votes—more than 69 percent of the voting delegates.

McArdle's first tweet after winning was characteristic of her caucus' style: It mocked the L.P.'s recent past quote-tweeting a March 2020 post that mentioned social distancing. She told the convention Friday she would not allow the party to ""humiliate ourselves and alienate everyone"" when faced with the next COVID-style crisis.

McArdle a paralegal and current chair of the Libertarian Party of Los Angeles County said in her speech to the convention Friday that the government response to COVID has left many working-class Americans thirsty for personal liberty and ""we don't want to ignore them."" They have she argued ""low-resolution views of freedom…and we need to bring that vision into focus by communicating our message clearly and by supporting our candidates and affiliates.""

While McArdle was the Mises Caucus candidate the behind-the-scenes mastermind of its victory was caucus founder and leader Michael Heise. His disapproval of William Weld Gary Johnson's running mate in 2016 was an initial inspiration for the caucus' launch. He found Weld painfully lacking in libertarian orthodoxy especially when it came to issues such as war and gun regulations.

The caucus's official platform is plumb-line libertarian but its foes say that too many Mises Caucus members and fans downplay libertarian positions that might offend the right are intentionally obnoxious and bullying and are often racist. For example the New Hampshire L.P. a powerful vector of Mises Caucus messaging tweeted on Martin Luther King Day that ""America isn't in debt to black people. If anything it's the other way around."" (The tweet was later deleted.)

The sense the caucus is soft on or actively encourages racism attracted the attention of the Southern Poverty Law Center just before the convention began which aired the concerns in a story reported with cooperation from many Libertarian Party members upset with the Mises Caucus.

Both Heise and Mises Caucus stalwart Joshua Smith who won the vice-chair election Saturday denied the charges of racism. Heise* said in a phone interview prior to the convention that the basic vibe they are seeking is online youths into edgy comedic podcasts a new counterculture for whom the old L.P. holds little appeal. Heise believes that the current rumored frontrunner for a Mises Caucus–approved presidential nominee in 2024 comedian and podcaster Dave Smith is so well-connected to the Joe Rogan world that legacy respectable mainstream media will be meaningless for party messaging moving forward.

In his nominating speech for McArdle before the vote libertarian antiwar author and podcaster Scott Horton insisted that he's seen thousands of new convention-attending members energized by the Mises Caucus in the last couple of years. (The last non-presidential L.P. convention I covered in 2006 had only slightly more than 300 delegates and I doubt more than 20 of them were under 30 years old. This convention drew more than 1000 and while this is only a guess based on pacing around a huge packed room for a couple of days I'd say one-third of them might have been under 35.)

Meanwhile during that same period fierce factional dueling has played out in hundreds of hours of podcasts hundreds of thousands of words of tweets and Facebook threads and often on the business listserv of the Libertarian National Committee (LNC) itself. One such fight summed up at length in Reason in June involved a faction of non-Mises libertarians in New Hampshire attempting to create a new L.P. affiliate so that the national party could disaffiliate the Mises-dominated one and recognize the new one. The gambit which ultimately failed led to the resignation of then-national chair Joe Bishop-Henchman and caused one of the party's few elected officials Dekalb Illinois City Clerk Sasha Cohen to quit in protest as well saying ""we are a big tent party but no tent is big enough to hold racists and people of color transphobes and trans people bigots and their victims.""

Despite bad blood I detected no booing or walkouts today when McArdle's victory made the caucus' victory manifest. None of the anti–Mises Caucus delegates or supporters that I have spoken to at the convention—including people from Illinois Florida Texas Massachusetts and even Mises stronghold New Hampshire—said that this takeover would make them walk.

Two former significant donors to the L.P. Kyle Varner and Michael Chastain both with decadeslong history in the party did say in phone interviews that the Mises turn which they see as importing a level of racist edgelording they have no taste for has made them stop funding L.P. candidates. Such defections are particularly relevant in this environment: The national L.P. has just had three months in a row of spending exceeding income and the number of active donors has been falling for seven straight months.

Varner and Chastain see a distinctly right-wing culture and policy bent from the Mises faction. The caucus whose whipping of its team proved very effective at the convention (combining Discord channels and physical signs waved on the floor featuring Ron Paul saying ""yes"" and Bill Weld saying ""no"") wants to eliminate from the L.P.'s platform a statement that ""we condemn bigotry as irrational and repugnant."" (This first entered the platform in 1974 though it has not remained there consistently.)

The caucus also wants to completely eliminate any mention of abortion replacing a current plank that is effectively pro-choice though it says in essence that Libertarians can differ in opinion based on when they think a protectable life begins.

A document of internal Mises Caucus strategizing that began circulating before the convention explicitly said—with reference to the plan to eliminate the line about bigotry being irrational and repugnant—that ""one of the major goals of the Mises Caucus is to make the LP appealing to the wider liberty movement that is largely not currently here with us. That movement strongly rejects wokeism and the word games associated with it. This along with the deletion of the abortion plank will display that there are serious cultural changes in the party that are more representative of that movement."" (The platform issues had not yet been decided at press time.)

Pennsylvania's new Mises-affiliated state chair Rob Cowburn insisted in a pre-convention interview that despite rumors otherwise he intends to continue his state's record of winning over 100 local positions in odd-numbered years by hunting for ones in which no other person is likely to be running generally offices such as auditor and constable. (Disgruntled non–Mises Caucus libertarians in Pennsylvania have left the L.P. and formed the new Keystone Party.)

The L.P.'s most successful electoral project above the local level has been the Frontier Project which got the L.P. its only currently seated state legislator Marshall Burt in Wyoming. The project focuses on finding winnable elections generally with just one major party candidate in opposition in the West where libertarian feelings tend to run higher. McArdle in a May podcast appearance on The System Is Down while musing about bad financial management and accountability in the L.P. said that while she thinks the Frontier Project is ""fantastic"" she worries that is ""difficult to understand what that money was spent on where it went why it took so much money to get him elected."" She considers the per-vote cost for Burt's victory overly high and she wonders about ""secrecy"" around the funding with no one outside the LNC knowing exactly how the whole project works.

Apollo Pazell who runs the Frontier Project said in a phone interview a week before the convention that he was not aware McArdle had concerns about the finances of the project which gets support from county state and national branches of the party as well as from separate funding sources.

The Mises Caucus' foes have accused the faction of planning to stop running candidates against Republicans they like. Heise denied this in a phone interview before the convention. The Mises-run party will continue to try to run local candidates especially he said with a preferred strategy of straight-up localist nullification of federal laws. ""Decentralization"" is a mantra of Heise's and the caucus's Twitter feed has openly been against the long-held legal principle that the 14th Amendment means that states and localities also have to obey the federal Bill of Rights. Most libertarians might see decentralization as an often useful tool that often can increase liberty but nonetheless agree that the federal government forcing states and localities to respect rights is perfectly fine. Heise in a phone interview suggested that federal pressure even to honor citizens' liberty is an unacceptable violation of the decentralization principle.

Christopher Thrasher who has been senior staff on multiple Libertarian presidential campaigns and ran ballot access for Gary Johnson's 50-state sweep worries that the Mises Caucus troops lacks granular knowledge of the terribly complex regulations surrounding ballot access and running campaigns. This he says is especially dangerous for the L.P. as inflation hits the cost of collecting signatures for ballot access.

Heise wrote on Facebook Friday night that his faction already controls a majority of the LNC having swept the votes for regional representatives to the LNC in meetings Friday night. (More LNC member votes are still ahead in the convention which does not end until Sunday.) Mises Caucus favorite Caryn Ann Harlos who was booted by the LNC from her elected secretary position over Mises-related faction fights re-won her elected position Saturday as well.

The Mises Caucus people often dub themselves the revival or continuation of the Ron Paul revolution of libertarian ideas in the GOP's 2008 and 2012 presidential races. (Paul spoke at a party the caucus hosted Friday night.)

Heise thinks the most important connection between the Ron Paul revolution and his caucus is its interest in uniting excited young activists with a sense of real community an idea he stressed over and over. His people enjoy hanging out and trying to save/piss off the world together. ""If you want to win elections"" Heise says ""you better damn well start getting people to think or care about the principles of liberty. And you have to have a home in order to from that point of stability build the culture build the base. And I think we can build that through the party."" The Mises Caucus has taken control of an estimated 35 state L.P.s and now the national party as well so that project now rests in its hands.

In those 2008 and 2012 races however Paul studiously avoided anything that might be construed as ""anti-woke"" and generally avoided talking to his campus audiences about abortion and immigration where he was at odds with many other libertarians. While the Mises Caucus might argue that the threat of progressive woke thought control was less severe then the podcaster/memelord edgy-offensive-insult-comedy stance they often embrace is entirely opposite to how Ron Paul presented himself and won his huge audience as a presidential candidate.

The general public will generally never know about LNC chairs or internal factions but many of them will be aware of who the L.P. runs for president. Former Michigan Rep. Justin Amash was the only sitting federal congressman the party has ever had. (He was elected to the House in 2010 as a Republican but he switched his affiliation to the L.P. in 2020.)

Amash said in an interview Friday that he has not made a decision to seek the L.P. nomination in 2024 but many assume he will. Amash sold himself in his keynote speech to the convention as proof that someone who presented himself ideologically as entirely libertarian can win federal office. He is not a Mises Caucus guy and in his keynote Friday he trolled them by reading various quotes—including some opposing anarchism and supporting cosmopolitan international cooperation—to a chorus of boos only to reveal that the quotes were from Ludwig von Mises himself.

""If you say Justin Amash isn't libertarian enough for you"" Amash told the Mises crowd ""then I've got news for you about the rest of the country."" Amash summed up the libertarian message as one of the richness and wonders of peaceful cooperation in markets and all human relations and said the L.P. must be the party of ""democracy of diversity of tolerance of humility.""

After his keynote speech Amash said in an interview that different conceptions of party messaging and mission are ""healthy for the party."" He has said he does not want to ally with any caucus. That may be the only strategy left for a man who still entertains the possibility of being the presidential nominee of a party now thoroughly dominated by a caucus with which he has documented disagreements about substance tone and style. He denied trying to get a rise out of the Mises Caucus with his Mises quotes saying merely that ""it's important that all of us understand the foundations of libertarianism.""

JPMorgan’s relationships with gunmakers “have come down significantly and are pretty limited” Marianne Lake then the bank’s chief financial officer told reporters. “We do have robust risk management practices and policies associated with this” she said.

The bank along with Citigroup and other Wall Street firms did not completely shut the door on gun companies.

In a letter sent to the Texas attorney general this month JPMorgan the nation’s largest bank signaled its willingness to continue working with the firearm industry. The letter described the bank’s “longstanding business relationships” with the industry in the state noting that it “anticipates continuing such relationships into the future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMjgvY2hhc2UtdG8tbGF1bmNoLWNvbnN1bWVyLXRyYXZlbC1wb3J0YWwtY2xhaW1zLXRvcC01LXUtcy10cmF2ZWwtcHJvdmlkZXItd2l0aC04LWJpbGxpb24tc2FsZXMv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9jaGFzZS10by1sYXVuY2gtY29uc3VtZXItdHJhdmVsLXBvcnRhbC1jbGFpbXMtdG9wLTUtdS1zLXRyYXZlbC1wcm92aWRlci13aXRoLTgtYmlsbGlvbi1zYWxlcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chase to Launch Consumer Travel Portal; Claims Top 5 U.S. Travel Provider With $8 Billion in Sales,"Chase is doubling down on travel as an aspirational commerce category for its customers with giant numbers to back up its ambitions. Expect some more travel M&A by these banks.

Chase is planning to launch ChaseTravel.com later this year as a consumer portal for its cardholders and its bank customers a total of 66 million U.S. households in a big upgrade on its ambitions in the travel sector.

It is also disclosing details on the size of its travel business for the first time: it expects to reach about $8 billion in sales volume this year and aiming for $15 billion by 2025. It also said that in terms of U.S> leisure travel $1 in every $4 spent is on a Chase Card and $1 in every $3 spent is by a Chase customer. It also disclosed that it has now identified and plans to launch eight airport Chase Sapphire Lounges up from its previously disclosed four.

All of these details were disclosed at parent company JPMorgan Chase’s annual 2022 investor day earlier in May buried inside hundreds of slide presentations and presented by Marianne Lake co-CEO of consumer and community banking at JPMC on the investor day.

According to Lake: “We saw an opportunity during the pandemic to own our own destiny in travel and we acquired cxLoyalty a proprietary two-sided travel platform and Frosch itself a top ten leisure travel agency providing us now with the booking engine the content the servicing excellence and the concierge capabilities that our customers should expect. And today we estimate we are a top five U.S. consumer travel provider. “

This move to supersize its ambitions in travel and control its own destiny — vs. banks and credit card companies that typically work with third party travel agencies — comes on the backs of its acquisitions over the pandemic of travel loyalty and rewards services provider cxLoyalty and corporate and luxury travel agency Frosch. Chase has already migrated over its cardholders who use its rewards platform Ultimate Rewards to the cxLoyalty platform and as a result ditched Expedia as its sole travel provider.

It also comes as its financial competitor Capital One also leaned heavily into travel during the pandemic with its acquisition of companies such as Freebird Lola and invested in Hopper and recently relaunched its travel site powered by Hopper. Another competitor U.S. Bancorp bought Will Smith-backed travel platform TravelBank for $200 million in November last year.

From the JPMC investor day presentation these three slides below map out the state of its current business in travel along with its expansion plans.

From the presentation transcript the description as presented on the investor day worth extracting in full:

“Travel has been the center of gravity for our Ultimate Rewards program for a decade and remains the most aspirational lifestyle category for many of our customers. And we partner with some of the most admired brands in the travel industry. Travel is at the center of our card business.

“In terms of U.S. leisure travel $1 in every $4 spent is on a Chase Card and $1 in every $3 spent is by a Chase customer. And the stats for dining are quite similar. But only a small percentage of this spend went through our platform because our assets were not differentiated. But despite that in 2019 we were already a top 15 travel provider.

“We saw an opportunity during the pandemic to own our own destiny in travel and we acquired cxLoyalty a proprietary two-sided travel platform and Frosch itself a top ten leisure travel agency providing us now with the booking engine the content the servicing excellence and the concierge capabilities that our customers should expect. And today we estimate we are a top five US consumer travel provider.

“So a moment on the business case. Along with controlling the customer experience which is everything we now have full ownership economics. We have all of the travel commissions. We will be at scale and cross $10 billion of travel volume on the platform next year with strong underlying growth. And a point of reference the pre-pandemic Ultimate Rewards growth rate was a 26% two-year CAGR. And obviously assuming a continued benign environment we would expect to reach $15 billion of volume by 2025 if not before.

“Our travel business is cash flow positive today. The acquisitions pay back within six years on strong revenue margins. And for context here industry commissions mix dependent are about 10%. And now we’re getting all of that whereas previously we were not. The business will require little marketing expense as we leverage our existing customers and channels reinforced by our loyalty program Ultimate Rewards. And so the net of all of that we expect a net margin of about 5% plus or minus.

And the strategy we will launch ChaseTravel.com with Card customers later this year and then we’re going to open it up to all of our Chase customers. We will deliver distinctive content and experiences and become a full-service travel agency to our small business and premium leisure travelers. And we will introduce those important customers to our strategic partners and so the flywheel begins. So let me bring this to life through our evolving super app and ChaseTravel.com.

“So looking forward here we have 66 million US households including 5 million small business customers. And now we have 4 million Infatuation dining enthusiasts. We’ve got industry-leading products unmatched first party data and a two-sided commerce platform. And our strategy is to expose distinctive content to our broad customer base making Chase the best way to shop pay and borrow. Starting as I said with travel and introducing our customers to key merchants within our platform at scale.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2lyZS5pbi90aGUtYXJ0cy93ZWNyYXNoZWQtYXBwbGUtdHYtYWRhbS1uZXVtYW5uLXdld29ya9IBS2h0dHBzOi8vbS50aGV3aXJlLmluL2FydGljbGUvdGhlL3dlY3Jhc2hlZC1hcHBsZS10di1hZGFtLW5ldW1hbm4td2V3b3JrL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'WeCrashed' a Compelling Tale of Capitalist Greed of the Kind That Thrills One and All,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uZXRoZXJldW13b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tL2Etc3R1bm5pbmctanAtbW9yZ2FuLWNoYXJ0LWhpbnRzLXRoYXQtYml0Y29pbi1pcy1hY3RpbmctYS1sb3QtbGlrZS1nb2xkL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uZXRoZXJldW13b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tL2Etc3R1bm5pbmctanAtbW9yZ2FuLWNoYXJ0LWhpbnRzLXRoYXQtYml0Y29pbi1pcy1hY3RpbmctYS1sb3QtbGlrZS1nb2xkL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Stunning JP Morgan Chart Hints that Bitcoin is Acting A Lot Like Gold,"Summary:

A chart by the team at JP Morgan Chase superimposes Bitcoin’s and Gold’s ratios of realized volatilities and hints that BTC is acting a lot like the latter asset.

Bitcoin’s market cap and that of Gold could eventually equalize as they serve the same purpose.

But Bitcoin’s volatility hinders its market cap from growing to the level of Gold.

Analysts forecast that Bitcoin could retest $20k or lower this year.

Guggenheim’s Chief Investment Officier sees Bitcoin retesting $8k or lower as it has yet to prove itself as a credible institutional investment.

A chart by the team at JP Morgan Chase hints that Bitcoin is currently acting a lot like Gold. The chart shared below and courtesy of the team at Fortune magazine shows the ratio of the three-month and six-month realized volatilities of Bitcoin versus that of Gold.

Bitcoin’s and Gold’s Market Cap could Equalize as they Serve the Same Purpose.

Furthermore the report by the team at Fortune also forecasts that the total market cap of Bitcoin and Gold could eventually equalize as they serve the same purpose. But the market cap of Bitcoin held by institutional investors will not increase soon till its volatility stabilizes to comfortable levels as explained in the following statement.

…because volatility is so critical when it comes to institutional investors’ risk management the market cap of Bitcoin held by institutions likely won’t reach gold’s level until its volatility subsides.

Guggenheim’s Chief Investment Officer sees Bitcoin retesting $8k

With respect to Bitcoin’s short-term price movement the report by the Fortune MAgazine team hinted that BTC could fall to below $20k before the end of this year.

The potential of Bitcoin trading below $20k was also shared by Guggenheim’s Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd in a Bloomberg interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland. During the interview Mr. Minerd stated that he expected Bitcoin to fall to $8000 and that the crypto market is filled with ‘a bunch of yahoos.’

According to his analysis Bitcoin on a fundamental level should be worth $400000 primarily due to the US Fed’s ‘rampant money printing.’ However a flash to $8k might be necessary to allow for further growth. Additionally he stated that the Bitcoin and Crypto markets have yet to pass the test as credible institutional investments.

If the US slips into recession insiders will be the bag holders. That’s one conclusion to take from the latest update from JPMorgan’s quant team which suggests that but for record levels of corporate equity purchases in the year to date the US market correction would have been much worse.

It finds that 2022 has already been the worst since ‘Nam . . .

. . . . and fighting that trend equity buybacks are likely to reach an unprecedented $600bn in the first half.

Share repos were running three-to four-times above the trend in recent weeks JPMorgan says and the internal plunge protection teams still have plenty of ammo left. Ex-financial S&P 500 companies are sitting on $1.9tn in cash its screen shows — that’s some 219 US companies valued above $1bn with 25 per cent or more their market cap in cash.

But directors haven’t just been using shareholder money to buy the dip. Insider buy-to-sell ratios in sectors including tech and communications are running at their highest levels since 2012. There’s the marketwide view:

Without companies acting as buyers of last resort investor positioning would look even more bearish than suggested by the S&P 500’s drop from peak levels JPMorgan says. Its team advises to use average declines rather than capitalisation-weighted index levels for a clearer picture as it takes better account of companies less able to use buybacks to cushion their fall:

“Anything short of a recession will probably catch most investors completely wrong footed in our view especially after broad and severe drawdowns that are 75 per cent of the way to prior recession bottoms” writes the strategy team led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas.

All of which shines the spotlight on the recession-tolerant US defensive sectors which are trading at a near record premium versus cyclicals.

If the US somehow dodges recession investors would be expected to rotate back out of this lopsidedly defensive position. And if recession does happen “they will get annihilated anyhow under the last one standing doctrine used as a source of liquidity funding” adds JPMorgan sales trader Jack Atherton. “You should start preparing for either scenario.”"

The station which broadcasts music over FM airwaves in Santa Rosa at 103.1 Calistoga at 91.5 Ukiah at 101.3 and Hopland at 88.7 was recently sold to KFAITH which will begin broadcasting an all-talk Christian radio format featuring local and national programming.

According to Broken FM founder Keith Leitch the decision to pull the plug on the radio station has been a long time coming as his nonprofit organization One Ministries Inc. has expanded into TV with KQSL television station broadcasting Christian programming in Sonoma County and throughout the Bay Area.

“I didn’t want to break it up” Leitch said of the radio station. “But this should have happened long ago we were in maintenance mode for several years.”

The all-volunteer staff of Broken FM included technicians and DJs Chris Kuhner Tim Hopkins and Dustin Moore who all helped the station get off the ground in 2009 and who continued to be involved in the station in varying degrees over the years.

“I loved every part about Broken FM personally I had so much fun and I was go grateful for the opportunity it was hard to leave that behind” Kuhner who moved to Michigan in 2018 said. “It’s kind of like losing a friend I’m sad for sure that it’s not going to be on the air anymore.”

According to Kuhner the station reached both a local and global audience through online streaming. In addition to round-the-clock music programming Broken FM carried interviews with some of the biggest Christian-rock stars such as Switchfoot and KORN guitarist Brian ""Head"" Welch and would often broadcast remotely from live events.

“We had a tremendous community of people” Kuhner said.

Educated at New Mexico State University Leitch spent two years consulting on Federal Communications Commission license acquisitions before moving to Sonoma County in 2000 where he works full time at Keysight Technologies in Santa Rosa.

Some free consulting work he did for a church in Bethel Alaska led to his application for three FCC permits in the Juneau market. “I applied for everything I could get” Leitch said.

He ultimately proposed a trade of the Juneau permits for the Hopland station owned by Rocklin-based K-LOVE the nation's largest contemporary Christian music station.

With that Hopland station Leitch embarked on a personal mission to spread Christian values to young audiences through rock music boosting the signal into Sonoma County through a series of FM translators that rebroadcast the Hopland signal throughout the North Bay region.

Programming the music via a computer out of his Santa Rosa bedroom closet at first Leitch moved the station to the Luther Burbank Center for the Arts then called the Wells Fargo Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa where the station broadcast for two years in a room rented by the Santa Rosa Christian School. Since then the radio station has been based in an office building on Professional Drive in Santa Rosa.

Nine years ago Leitch moved into television. He bought a full power TV station licensed to Fort Bragg in 2018 called KQSL that is currently broadcasting from Sutro Tower in San Francisco and Sonoma Mountain and is available on cable in north Sonoma County from Windsor to Cloverdale Mendocino County Lake County San Francisco and throughout Northern California from Redding to San Jose.

KQSL airs local church services for Promise Center Church in Santa Rosa Saturdays at 4 p.m. and Sundays at 12:30 a.m. and 5 a.m.

“The TV has been rewarding with growth” Leitch said. “We’re reaching a huge audience throughout the Bay Area.”

Leitch says that while Broken FM struggled to get funding and donors for its decade-plus run KQSL garnered almost $1 million in revenue last year.

Leitch adds that the decline in rock radio is a national trend for both secular and nonsecular rock music. “The interest in rock music other than classic rock has gone down” Leitch said.

He also says younger people are adopting other technologies and don’t listen to the radio anymore.

“With Broken FM we were trying to reach the young people” Leitch said. “Now our ministry has flipped where we now reach a predominantly 55-plus audience with the Christian TV.”

Broken FM’s departure leaves K-LOVE and Air1 as the last two Christian music radio stations serving Sonoma County. K-Love broadcasts on 91.9 FM and Air1 broadcasts on 106.3 FM.

One Ministries Inc. will still be in radio. “We were granted a new construction permit for FM station on 91.1 for Glenhaven in Lake County this year” Leitch said. It’s not clear yet what that station will broadcast.

But in the weeks that followed the movie’s release the conversation around it steered sharply from championing a step forward in inclusive storytelling — the film marked the studio’s first to be solely directed by a Chinese-Canadian woman and featured its first lead Asian character — and devolved into a heated debate. The controversy would ultimately revolve around whether an animated movie targeted at children should be allowed even metaphorically to allude to menstruation.

In an interview with Polygon director and co-writer Domee Shi explained that the Red Panda metaphor spoke not only to puberty but also to “what we inherit from our moms and how we deal with the things that we inherit from them.”

“Everybody on the crew was unapologetic in support of having these real conversations about periods and about these moments in girls’ lives” producer Lindsey Collins said.

That decision didn’t sit well with some parents who descended on review hubs like Common Sense Media (which focuses on media suitability for children) to charge that the Pixar film had crossed a line for younger viewers with its “multiple mentions of periods and pads” as one reviewer noted.

“This was extremely disappointing! We’re all set to watch it with friends on a snow day and it’s completely inappropriate for any kids under 13” another adult reviewer who had marked the film as having “too much sex” wrote. “Puberty boy crazy lying to parents sneaking out and more unhealthy ways of dealing with emotions.”

(Puberty can begin as early as eight according to the Cleveland Clinic with menstruation starting around 12 though it can occur earlier.)

For Braceface creator Melissa Clarke the backlash sounded all too familiar. Her animated series which ran on the Disney-owned network ABC Family for three seasons tackled menstruation in 2001 during the show’s first season in “The Worst First Date Ever: Period.”

“I got a lot of letters from pissed-off moms” the writer and series creator recalled. “One of them said ‘My 13-year-old daughter and I thought we were sitting down to watch a fun cartoon and then I had to explain to her what a period was.’ We were like ‘Oh so that’s a thank you letter is what you’re saying.'”

Written by showrunner Alyse Rosenberg and “welcomed” by studio Nelvana the story saw its leading character “braceface” Sharon on her first date with a crush when she gets her first period. Ultimately the episode attempts to provide a look at how tweens can respond — with everything from anxiety to pride — to puberty-related experiences.

“It sort of captured the taboo subjects which is to say is life” Clarke said of her series overall. “I really wanted Braceface to be the TV version of a Judy Blume book to be a landing space for the kind of kid that I was that needed the storytelling.”

Lauren Rosewarne author of Periods in Pop Culture: Menstruation in Film and Television says negative reaction to these storylines has been an ongoing issue fueled by the perception of menstruation as an “adult” subject.

“There is a tendency for some people — generally conservative people often with strong religious convictions — to think that all sex education should be provided in the home rather than via third parties like schools or media” Rosewarne told THR. “Menstruation gets bundled together with other perceived ‘adult’ topics — like intercourse or masturbation — considered sensitive private and often uncomfortable or embarrassing to discuss.”

One result of that position has been historically negative representations of periods associating them with “embarrassment bad moods and occasionally even crime” she said. Additionally both live-action and animated film and TV have depicted the existence of menstruation as something to be used strategically — a convenient excuse for getting out of gym class or overindulging in food.

But not all shows have taken these kinds of approaches including the sitcom Roseanne which treated Darlene’s first period as “something positive” that enabled her to be a parent Rosewarne told THR. The representational treatment of periods in TV and film can also depend on the genre with comedies leaning into allusions while teen-oriented media is more likely to have a focus on education anticipation and even activism.

“I think animation aimed at younger audiences would be more likely to avoid including it unless it was consciously aiming to function as sex education” Rosewarne said.

That was the case for a 1946 Disney short The Story of Menstruation which was produced in partnership with the International Cellucotton Products Company the marketing arm of Kimberly-Clark maker of Kotex products. One of the first branded films used in schools and eventually shown to 100 million students the Walt Disney Company oversaw the first script drafts and the conceptualization of visual material with the producers bringing in a gynecologist consultant to ensure scientific accuracy.

The emphasis “on biological themes” in the script which was guided by K-C helped make its tone objective and unemotional according to Kotex Kleenex Huggies: Kimberly-Clark and the Consumer Revolution in American Business. Along with the short the ICPC released a supplemental teaching guide which suggested educators address menstruation informally in fourth grade before a more “systematic” focus in seventh.

This more sanitized approach shaped in part by a screen test that resulted in major edits was by design Bob Batchelor Kotex Kleenex Huggies co-author told THR. “There were many cultural factors that K-C and Disney had to consider when making The Story of Menstruation like how to show sexual organs and depict blood” he explained. “They had to be tactful and sensitive particularly if they wanted to gain wide approval. Then as now much of the nation was overtly conservative in its views of sexuality and sex education so the film had to sidestep potential barriers.”

Rosewarne notes that the U.S. TV and film industry historically operated under production codes that made it difficult to present menstruation. The dominance of men in media production as well as network and classification concerns were also influences on period representation. “Generally producers want their material seen by as many people as possible therefore they will often avoid including content that will limit who can see it” she said.

Released decades apart The Story of Menstruation Turning Red and Braceface were ultimately grappling with the same threat of backlash. But unlike its more modern counterparts the short and its supplemental materials’ broaching of menstruation were accepted as age-appropriate for those under 13. It was lauded during its initial release by teachers administrators and parents “yearning for high quality educational resources” Batchelor said. One student even described it as something that could be enjoyed “instead of feeling hush-hush.”

“Schools had a more direct role in preparing youngsters for life rather than a focus on going to college so health and sex ed were extremely important” said Batchelor of sex education being more central in the education system then compared to present-day.

Despite this mixed reception around menstruation animation Rosewarne says the stigma around periods onscreen has “absolutely lessened over time” thanks to the Internet social media cable TV and now streaming services. “They are simply not beholden to the taste or classification concerns that have plagued cinema and broadcast television” she concluded.

For Clarke the shift is important as a creative who wants to help those who are seeking answers.

“Looking back as a kid I was just so full of shame and everything felt icky and weird. I guess because my parents weren’t comfortable with any of it. So I really picked up shame from it and I feel like there was absolutely no need for that” Clarke said. “Why is it so loaded for some people when it’s just part of being alive?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vdmlkZW8va290ZXgtY2FtcGFpZ24tZGVwaWN0cy13b21lbi1vd25pbmctdGhlLW5pZ2h0LWR1cmluZy1wZXJpb2RzLzQ3ODE3NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kotex campaign depicts women 'owning the night' during periods | Advertising,"Female hygiene products brand Kotex has relaunched in India with a new product line – Kotex Overnight Period Panties. The brand has rolled out a campaign for this titled #OwnTheNight to highlight how women can take on the cycle of discomfort and gloom that is often accompanied by periods especially in the night.

Conceptualised by Ogilvy the films encourage women to not let their menstrual cycle come in the way of living life.

The films feature a biker a hula hoop expert and a gamer wearing the Kotex overnight period panties and doing what they love to do all through the night without fretting over their periods.

Saakshi Verma Menon marketing director Kimberly- Clark India said “As a brand Kotex strives to work towards a world where a period never stands in the way of a girl’s progress. The Indian girl today understands that periods are a natural process and openly wants to challenge any taboos or pre-existing negative biases that exist around it. We relaunch Kotex in India with the innovative and convenient overnight period panties. As a woman I can vouch for how life changing this product is and I am thrilled to be able to launch this for the women in this country. Kotex overnight period panties offer women an unparalleled experience of a 360 degree leak free protection. For decades women have been held back at night and periods have been a yet another reason for it . With the launch of this product we encourage women to not let their period hold them back so they can own the night – in whatever way they choose to.”

Tanuja Bhat senior executive creative director Ogilvy India said ""In a world that says that girls should be back home before night sets in Kotex as a brand believes that confident young girls can proclaim ‘I own the night I am the change’ and freely do as they please; be a professional gamer a hula hooper a night rider or simply take a rest night. The brand launch campaign challenges society’s regressive mindset and gives girls a powerful statement an anthem that captures their unstoppable spirit as they set out into the world. The innovative product - Kotex Overnight Period Panties challenges traditional formats and offers modern superior period protection. Together they bring alive the Kotex belief that ‘periods should not come in the way of a woman’s progress’.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vcGxhbi1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLm9yZy9jaGluYS1lbi93aGF0LXdlLWRvL2luY2x1c2l2ZS1xdWFsaXR5LWVkdWNhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inclusive quality education in China,"We support children especially those in difficult situations and those affected by migration to learn for life through gender-friendly inclusive and quality education.

The education projects Plan International has implemented in Shaanxi Ningxia and Yunnan support rural children especially girls to access a quality education.

In the past year we launched the girls and technology project to promote girls’ STEM education the children’s reading project to boost reading and social skills in primary schools and a child-led activity to tackle gender inequality and establish a gender-responsive school environment.

Through our programmes the awareness of gender equality among children teachers and parents has improved.

Equal opportunities in STEM

Stereotypes regarding boys and girls in academic success and career choices can shape their development. Over time even the children themselves will believe in the limitations of their own ability and potential.

In response to China’s practices and policies in promoting and exploring STEM education (an interdisciplinary method of teaching that integrates science technology engineering and mathematics) throughout 2021 through cooperation with enterprises and academic institutions Plan International has supported local education authorities to carry out the girls and technology project in 64 primary and secondary schools. This was set out to tap into the maximum potential and inspire children in rural communities with a particular focus on girls.

By improving teachers’ capacities in STEM running on-campus clubs providing platforms to display student work exposing children to robotics programming and more STEM education is introduced and taught to children in rural communities. The project offers gender equality training for teachers invites female representatives within the technology industry to participate in activities and talk about the application of their work in society and breaks gender stereotypes around suitable career choices.

The project also implements the growth mindset training model of the Beijing Normal University Department of Psychology. When you teach growth mindset to teachers and children especially young girls it fosters a positive attitude to facing challenges and failures allowing them to take on harder challenges in both their education and lives. This model has shown significant results in helping children especially young girls study STEM subjects.

Nurturing children’s reading and social skills

The importance of reading for children’s growth and development is self-evident. However rural children have far less access to reading resources than those in urban areas. In order to cultivate reading habits for children at a young age Plan International worked with local education authorities to promote reading. In the rural communities of Shaanxi Ningxia and Yunnan Plan International trained 120 teachers across 57 primary schools and organised participatory reading events.

In Guangnan County Yunnan and Wuzhong City Ningxia paired reading was introduced. By identifying the different stages of language use and cognitive development the children are in they are given appropriate reading materials to increase their literacy level and build social skills and confidence. At the same time schools can start a reading challenge during summer or winter breaks through the project to help students develop good reading habits and skills.

Improving menstrual health and hygiene

With the support of Kimberly-Clark and its Kotex brand Plan International has worked with local education bureaus and social organisations to carry out the menstrual health education programme.

It helps young people gain menstrual health knowledge thereby allowing girls to grow in a positive environment and thrive.

We also encourage college students to actively publicise this message on campuses to dispel the stigma and taboo around menstruation and spread accurate knowledge regarding health and hygiene. The programme will be implemented in 33 primary schools middle schools and colleges and will benefit nearly 10000 children and youth.

After seven seasons on AMC’s Fear the Walking Dead original castmember Alycia Debnam-Carey has exited the series.

Debnam-Carey played Alicia Clark on the show which debuted in 2015 as a prequel to The Walking Dead. On Sunday night’s show her character was seen struggling after being bitten by a zombie. After successfully fighting off the fever that would spur her being turned in a zombie herself Alicia decides to head off to help others.

Coincidentally Debnam-Carey’s onscreen mother played by Kim Dickens was set to return in the back half of this season after departing the show in season four. The bulk of the show’s original series regular cast have departed over the years alongside the original showrunner.

Debnam-Carey confirmed her departure which comes in the wake of her joining the upcoming Hulu series Saint X on Instagram noting that Sunday’s episode “marks the end of an extraordinary and life changing journey of playing Alicia Clark.”

She added: “I was 21 when we began this crazy journey but now at 28 after 7 years and 100 episodes I decided it was time for me to move on as an actor and as a person. As is the nature of our jobs I needed to seek out new challenges new opportunities and carve out a new chapter for myself. I have been so lucky to be a part of something so awesome for so long but I hope you can understand and respect my choice to further expand and grow. I wouldn’t be here without you all and I am so grateful.”

The actress who also made her directorial debut on an episode of the show this season wrote that leaving the show was “bittersweet but it is time.”

Here’s the info from the FDA which was updated on May 28 2022:

Recommended Videos

The FDA along with CDC the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency state and local partners are investigating a multistate outbreak of hepatitis A infections in the United States and Canada potentially linked to fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo and HEB purchased between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022.

Currently the potentially affected FreshKampo and HEB products are past shelf life. People who purchased FreshKampo and HEB fresh organic strawberries between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022 and then froze those strawberries for later consumption should not eat them. These products were sold at the following retailers including but not limited to:

Aldi

HEB

Kroger

Safeway

Sprouts Farmers Market

Trader Joe’s

Walmart

Weis Markets

WinCo Foods

If you are unsure of what brand you purchased when you purchased your strawberries or where you purchased them from prior to freezing them the strawberries should be thrown away.

Epidemiologic and traceback data show that fresh organic strawberries sold as FreshKampo and HEB brands that were purchased between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022 are a likely cause of illness in this outbreak. The traceback investigations show that cases in California Minnesota and Canada report having purchased fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo or HEB prior to becoming ill. Illness onset dates range from March 28 – April 30 2022.

As this investigation is ongoing additional products may be included. More information will be provided in this advisory as it becomes available.

Recommendation

Consumers restaurants and retailers should not sell serve or eat any fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo or HEB if purchased between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022. People who purchased the fresh strawberries and then froze those strawberries for later consumption should not eat them. They should be thrown away. Currently the potentially affected product is past its shelf life. If you are unsure of what brand you purchased when you purchased your strawberries or where you purchased them from prior to freezing them the strawberries should be thrown away.

If consumers purchased fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo or HEB between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022 ate those berries in the last two weeks and have not been vaccinated against hepatitis A they should immediately consult with their healthcare professional to determine whether post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is needed. PEP is recommended for unvaccinated people who have been exposed to hepatitis A virus in the last two weeks because vaccination can prevent a hepatitis A infection if given within 14 days of exposure. Those with evidence of previous hepatitis A vaccination or previous hepatitis A infection do not require PEP.

Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)

Hepatitis A is a contagious virus that can cause liver disease. A hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. In rare cases particularly for people with a pre-existing health condition or people with weakened immune systems hepatitis A infections can progress to liver failure and death.

The majority of hepatitis A infections are from unknown causes or from being in close contact with an infected person; however some hepatitis A infections are caused by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Contamination of food and water can occur when an infected food handler prepares food without appropriate hand washing hygiene.

Symptoms

Illness usually occurs within 15 to 50 days after eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Symptoms of hepatitis A infection include fatigue nausea vomiting abdominal pain jaundice dark urine and pale stool. In some instances particularly in children under the age of six hepatitis A infection may be asymptomatic.

People with hepatitis A infections usually completely recover within one to two weeks; however in rare cases hepatitis A may become chronic causing relapsing infection. Chronic hepatitis A infection can lead to more severe health problems including liver failure and death.

Due to the range in severity of illness people should consult their health care provider if they suspect that they have developed symptoms that resemble a(n) hepatitis A infection.

At-Risk Groups

All people are susceptible to hepatitis A infection; however individuals who have had hepatitis A before or who have been vaccinated are immune to hepatitis A infection. Learn more about People at Risk of Foodborne Illness.

Treatment and Prevention of Hepatitis A

Because hepatitis A virus infections can have serious health consequences the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends providing post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated people who have consumed any contaminated food or water within two weeks of exposure.

PEP consists of:

Hepatitis A vaccine for people between the ages of 1 and 40 years

Hepatitis A virus-specific immunoglobulin (IG) for people outside of this age range but the hepatitis A vaccine can be substituted if IG is not available.

Those with evidence of previous vaccination or who can confirm previous hepatitis A illness do not require PEP.

If you are unsure if you have been vaccinated against hepatitis A contact your health professional to check your immunization records. If you have been vaccinated no further action is needed. If you have never received the hepatitis A vaccine getting a single dose within two weeks of exposure can protect against illness. If you are unable to determine whether you have already been vaccinated receiving an additional dose of vaccine is not harmful if you have already been vaccinated.

Who Should Receive the Hepatitis A Vaccine?

In general CDC recommends the following groups be vaccinated for hepatitis A:

All children at age 1 year

Travelers to countries that have high rates of hepatitis A

Family members and caregivers of recent adoptees from countries where hepatitis A is common

Men who have unprotected sexual contact with other men

Users of injection and illegal drugs

People with chronic (lifelong) liver diseases hepatitis B or hepatitis C

People who are treated with clotting-factor concentrates

People who work with hepatitis A infected animals or in a hepatitis A research laboratory

Foods Linked to U.S. Outbreaks of Hepatitis A

Although foodborne illnesses caused by hepatitis A are not common in the U.S. water shellfish raw vegetables and fruit (berries) and salads are most frequently cited as potential foodborne sources.

Preventing Foodborne Illness at Home

Hepatitis A can have serious health consequences. The CDC advises the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) described above for unvaccinated persons who have consumed any products contaminated by the hepatitis A virus.

To prevent hepatitis A contamination or transmission consumers should always practice safe food handling and preparation measures by following the steps below:

Wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw foods.

Thoroughly wash hands after using the bathroom and changing diapers for protection against hepatitis A as well as other foodborne diseases.

Wash the inside walls and shelves of the refrigerator cutting boards and countertops and utensils that may have contacted contaminated foods; then sanitize them with a solution of one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to one gallon of hot water; dry with a clean cloth or paper towel that has not been previously used.

Wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process.

Consumers can also  a complaint or adverse event (illness or serious allergic reaction) related to a food product. submit a voluntarily report  a complaint or adverse event (illness or serious allergic reaction) related to a food product.

Advice for Restaurants and Retailers

Retailers restaurants and other food service operators who have processed and packaged any potentially contaminated products need to be concerned about cross contamination of cutting surfaces and utensils through contact with the potentially contaminated products.

In the event that retailers and/or other food service operators are found to have handled recalled or other potentially contaminated food in their facilities they should:

Wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw foods.

Contact their local health department and communicate to their customers regarding possible exposure to hepatitis A virus and the potential benefit of post-exposure prophylaxis.

Wash the inside walls and shelves of the refrigerator cutting boards and countertops and utensils that may have contacted contaminated foods; then sanitize them with a solution of one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to one gallon of hot water; dry with a clean cloth or paper towel that has not been previously used.

Wash and sanitize display cases where potentially contaminated products were served or stored.

Always wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process.

Conduct regular frequent cleaning and sanitizing of cutting boards and utensils used in processing to help minimize the likelihood of cross-contamination.

FreshKampo and HEB branded strawberries purchased by consumers between March 5 and April 25 should not be eaten according to the FDA.

The affected strawberries which are past their shelf life were sold at retailers nationwide including Aldi HEB Kroger Safeway Sprouts Farmers Market Trader Joe's Walmart Weis Market and WinCo Foods.

Cases of hepatitis A have been reported by consumers in California Minnesota and Canada all of whom purchased strawberries before falling ill. At least 17 illnesses and 12 hospitalizations have been recorded so far nationwide according to the FDA.

Hepatitis A is a contagious virus that can ultimately cause liver disease according to the FDA. Symptoms include fatigue nausea vomiting abdominal pain jaundice dark urine and pale stools. Infections typically recover within one to two weeks though in rare cases it may become chronic.

Strawberries should be thrown away if you are unsure what brand was purchased or when and where they were bought the FDA recommended. Frozen strawberries should also be thrown away.

Anyone experiencing symptoms of hepatitis A after consuming strawberries should contact their health care provider."

In the process chip design will be democratized in line with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that – Design in India is as important as Make in India.

Understanding chip design as a strategic necessity a pilot deployment was successfully tested by MeitY earlier in 2021 under Special Manpower Development Programme for Chips to System Design (SMDP-C2SD) wherein a centralized design facility at C-DAC was enabled for remote access by over 50000 engineering students at 60 academic institutions for designing chips. Leapfrogging MeitY now intends to make accessible a centralized chip design infrastructure to be made available at India Chip Centre setup at C-DAC to train 85000+ B.Tech M.Tech and PhD students at 120 academic institutions across the country in chip design area for next 5 years.

For making available the chip design infrastructure at India Chip Centre (C-DAC) leading industry vendors from EDA (Electronic Design Automation) Electronic Computer-Aided Design (ECAD) IP Core and Design solutions Industry are being partnered with. Specific collaborative arrangements are being made available with Synopsys Cadence Design Systems Siemens EDA Silvaco & other leading tool vendors IP & design solution providers and Fab aggregators.

At centralized design facility hosted at India Chip Centre (C-DAC) not only the most advanced tools for entire chip design cycle (i.e. Front-end design Back-end design PCB design & analysis etc. for Digital Analog RF & Mixed Signal designs) going up to 7nm or advanced node but also an arrangement of instructor-led/ online trainings on design flows by industry professionals are being made available for next 5 years.

This centralized facility at India Chip Centre (C-DAC) one of the biggest of existing facilities offering plethora of design flows aims to bring the chip design infrastructure at door-steps of over 85000 students at 120 academic institutions. Taking advantage several academic start-ups will mushroom across the country cross the initial entry barriers and pave the way for entrepreneurship/ startup-led design & innovations ecosystem in the country making indigenous IP Cores Chips System on Chip (SoCs) Systems for different application areas like 5G/ IoT AI/ ML Automotive & Mobility sector etc. in India for the World.

As SemiconIndia 2022 concluded successfully last week most of the global semiconductor leaders (like Intel Micron Qualcomm LAM Research etc) not only highlighted the contribution of their Indian R&D centres which are now the biggest centres out of their headquarter locations but also acknowledged the semiconductor design strength in our country which now makes up for 20% of the world’s engineers.

Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw Minister for Electronics & Information Technology envisions making available a design talent pool of highly skilled engineers for turning India into a semiconductor hub through the Chips to Startup (C2S) Programme and other initiatives in Semiconductor policy. This will strengthen & supplement the Indian talent pool designing the leading-edge chips for semiconductor giants with complete ownership of some of these chips in the country. Speaking at SemiconIndia 2022 he highlighted that India’s democracy and talent pool sets it apart from other countries fighting for chip sovereignty.

Many co-development pacts were announced at SemiconIndia 2022 last week by Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar Minister of State for Electronics & Information Technology including Digital India RISC-V (DIR-V) Program aiming to catalyze India’s semiconductor ecosystem. These announcements coupled with the fact that India has just scored a century of Unicorns this week and the steps taken to democratize the chip design across the country shall trigger the next wave of Startups and unicorns from semiconductor design space in the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZS52bmV4cHJlc3MubmV0L25ld3MvdHJlbmQvdmlldG5hbWVzZS1zdHVkZW50cy1pbi11cy1wZXRyaWZpZWQtYnktZ3VuLXZpb2xlbmNlLTQ0Njk2MzAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vietnamese students in US petrified by gun violence,"Worried about becoming victims of mass shootings Vietnamese students in the U.S. try to protect themselves and pray but do not let it deter their dreams.

Nguyen Quoc Bao Lam woke up on May 24 to find his Twitter feed flooded with news about the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde Texas.

The mass shooting which killed 19 children and two teachers is the worst school massacre in the last decade and the seventh deadliest in U.S. history.

The 20-year-old Vietnamese student in Houston four hours away from Uvalde was baffled by the event and worried about his own safety.

""Sometimes when I walk down the street late at night I'm afraid someone will shoot me from behind"" he says.

Despite worrying about gun violence and their personal safety Vietnamese students in the U.S. have no choice but to get accustomed to America's gun culture if they want to benefit from one of the best education systems in the world.

A 2019 survey of 2000 international students and recent graduates of American colleges done by research company World Education Services found nearly two-fifths were concerned about gun violence.

Students at rural universities were more concerned than those in urban centers.

The survey said this might be due to the fact that rural communities tend to have more guns. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 46 percent say they are gun owners compared with 28 percent of those who live in the suburbs and 19 percent in urban areas.

Lam says he is scared because he ""is not used to this"" since owning a gun is a ""very western thing.""

He fears he might become a victim of a massacre one day considering the frequency of mass shootings in America.

Gun violence is more common in the U.S. than any other developed country.

The gun death rate in the U.S. was 10.6 per 100000 people in 2016 significantly higher than in Canada (2.1 per 100000) and Australia (1) France (2.7) Germany (0.9) and Spain (0.6) according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In 2020 the most recent year for which complete data is available 45222 people died of gun-related injuries according to the CDC.

These figures and gun violence reported in the news alarm many Vietnamese students in the U.S.

""It's scary when you go out and have to keep an eye out for potential armed offenders all the time"" Trinh Anh Thu who lives in New York City says.

Thu 28 was a passenger on a train in Manhattan last Sunday when a gunman shot and killed Daniel Enriquez 48.

""It's like a horror movie! You go out and there is a chance someone will shoot you.""

The train attack followed a mass shooting on another train last month that injured at least 23 people and the shoving death of a woman at the Times Square station in January.

Nguyen Duc Thanh 25 of Arlington City Virginia is also concerned about safety when going out at night or to crowded places.

""I'm always a potential shooting victim because anyone here can get a gun"" he says.

Protecting themselves

As the misery grows because of the rising gun violence many Vietnamese students are taking protective measures both inside and outside school.

Tran Le Minh Hoang 19 in Florida shares his GPS location with close friends and family back home so that they are always aware of his whereabouts.

He even carries a pepper spray with him in case he encounters a shooter or violent crime in his neighborhood.

""Mass shootings and gun-related violence are common in this country. I need to do something to make myself secure when I go out.""

Many international students fear gun violence and random attacks and have developed cautious behaviors such as avoiding crowds and going out at night.

Ngoc Lan a junior college student in New York travels in groups like Hoang because she is afraid of armed robbery and other crimes.

When she goes out late at night on her own she uses an app on her phone to notify her emergency contacts if she does not arrive at her destination within an allotted time.

Though she has not personally witnessed gun violence the thought of being shot down by a random person on the street is always on her mind.

""If there's a crazy person walking down the street with a gun I might be in danger because of my race or nationality.""

Foreign students are also concerned about the unrestricted access visitors get to university campuses and perplexed by the ease of gun availability in America which contributes directly to school shootings.

Nguyen Nhat Anh in California says people can freely walk in and out of schools which need to increase security measures and install metal detectors and checks around the campus to detect suspects quickly and prevent attacks.

""This will make schools safer and help reduce incidents of school gun violence.""

But despite the hundreds of mass shootings that occur in the U.S. each year and the potential risk they face many Vietnamese students and their families dream of studying in the country.

Vietnam ranks fifth among countries that send students to the U.S. According to the most recent SEVIS update there were 25816 Vietnamese students as of June 2021 a majority at colleges and universities.

Hoang says his parents were happy for him to go to America where the education quality is high.

""I can't let [fear of gun violence] get in the way of my dream of studying abroad.""

The only concession he makes is to be cautious when going out alone at night.

Le Quoc Hoang Hai of HCMC's District 7 intends to send his two sons aged 12 and 11 to Orange County California in the next two years.

""The U.S. has higher education quality than other countries like Canada and Australia"" he says pointing out that every country has its downsides.

In Texas where Lam studies people can openly carry rifles in public without a permit.

""I pray for myself every day but gun violence will not deter me from pursuing my dream.""",,,,,,,,,

We might not see them in Vegas again.

Live from the Sphere (in a hat trick of firsts) it’s the NHL Draft

Zac Brown says his band is coming to the Sphere

The Eagles gave a concert and hosted a voyage on Saturday night on the Strip.

“This is a three-hour vacation from the real world” founding member Don Henley told the packed crowd at MGM Grand Garden. He later added that the band was celebrating the 50th anniversary of being on the radio with “Take it Easy.”

“It was a fast 50” Henley said. “Thank you for supporting us on this journey.”

Guitarist Joe Walsh was steering his own time machine.

“I had a hell of a lot more fun when I was in my 20s in the ’70s then I do when I’m in my 70s in the ’20s” Walsh said. The crowd cheered that too. They got it. Most of those who crammed into the Grand Garden creating a sea of silver hair could identify.

The band performed “Hotel California” in its entirety then broke for a few minutes (for the inevitable restroom break as Henley called out) then finished with a stream of hits to fill that three-hour performance. The band had started this road trip at MGM Grand Garden Sept. 27-28 and Oct. 5 2019. Bassist Timothy B. Schmit called the arena the band’s Las Vegas home as it has headlined Grand Garden several times over the years following their in 1994 show at Sam Boyd Silver Bowl (now Sam Boyd Stadium) through 2016 with the late Glenn Frey.

Country-rock great Vince Gill has since replaced Frey onstage. The band again played flawless renditions of the full “Hotel California” album released in 1976. The album has since sold 32 million copies (26-times platinum). The hits dropped on the crowd like a springtime rainshower. The sing-alongs were led by the title song “New Kid In Town” “Life in The Fast Lane” the singles from the album.

Post-intermission it was “One Of These Nights” “Take It To The Limit” and “Heartache Tonight.” Walsh had a turn with “Life’s Been Good.” It’s a joy to watch Gill grinning over at the guitarist as he growls through the lyrics “My Maserati goes 185. I lost my license now I don’t drive.” Henley’s brilliant “Boys of Summer” slid into the night’s mellow culmination “Best Of My Love.”

The four primary members bowed it out with Walsh tailing the group and giving a final wave. It might be the last Vegas show for this band for the ages. But we thought that last time and even back to ‘94. But we are sure that by every measurable means they do not make ‘em like the Eagles anymore.

Give it to the locals

The Eagles could well track a 22-person choir and 39-member string section. But no. The band hired Vegas artists to back select numbers on Friday night. Lady Gaga and Michael Buble have also recently filled full orchestras largely with Vegas musicians and Buble also added singers.

Those Las Vegas entertainers who co-starred with the Eagles deserve a nod and also some intense bold-faced action here:

Michelle Johnson’s Desert Angels sang on “The Last Resort.” Those Las Vegas singers were Johnson Cynthia Abney Kathryn Arianoff Danyel Arianna Ryan Baker Avana Christie Lannie Counts Fred Crescente Eileen Deadwiler Viqtory Destined Aretha Harden Robert Hyatt Patty Janura Amanda Kaiser Jen Mrozik Christopher Lash Naomi Mauro Caleb McKee Karen Michaels Jennifer Mrozik Carol Pritchard Ethena Profit. Hector Ramos and Robin Vincent.

And from the Angela Chan-Stopa contracted Sin City Strings (“I don’t name ‘em I just read what’s on the teleprompter” Henley said) we had:

Violins: Alexandria Pritchard Ferenc Cseszko Nataliya Karachentseva James Harvey Christina Levi De Ann Letourneau Susan Kim Geri Thompson Adriana Thurber-Shaw Chandra Meibalane Peter Goomroyan Shakeh Ghoukasian Kevork Mikaelian Melanie Schiemer and Erika Syroid.

Violas: Tianna Harjo John Pollock Dmitri Kourka Carlene San Filipo Omar Shelly Taras Krysa Ivie Etkins-Turner Yunior Lopez Crystal Yuan and Hope Bowden

Cellos: Lindsey Springer Moonlight Tran Mandy Andreasen Elena Kapustina Mert Sermet Mariko Muranaka Jeremy Russo Ted Hartwell and Andy Smith.

Double Bass: Ryan Dudder Paul Firak Chris Davis and Josh Jones.

“It was surreal” Johnson said after the show. “It was incredible to be singing along with songs you have listened to your whole life.” Springer who has performed with Celine Dion among a host of other superstars called it “The show of a lifetime!” Can’t argue that.

WTOP's Jason Fraley previews Memorial Day Concert (Part 1)

The National Memorial Day Concert returns in person on Sunday night after two years of virtual events.

It will broadcast live on PBS from the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol at 8 p.m. Sunday.

“I’m so glad that we’re back live on site in front of the Capitol” co-host Joe Mantegna told WTOP. “We’ve had to do it virtually the last couple of years I still think we did a good job of putting the show together but it’s nice to be back. That’s the seat of our government.”

Mantegna (“Criminal Minds”) will co host once again with Gary Sinise (“Forrest Gump”).

“Joe started in 2002 mine was 2005” Sinise told WTOP. “He [asked] would I come bring my band to do a segment. I did it was magnificent wonderful to be on stage [with] 200000 people on the lawn and 10 million watching on PBS. Then Joe called and said ‘They’d like you to come back and co-host’ … and I’ve been doing it with Joe ever since.”

This year’s performers include Lea Salonga Norm Lewis Craig Morgan Rhiannon Giddens Brian Stokes Mitchell Pia Toscano and the National Symphony Orchestra.

You’ll also hear the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets U.S. Army Chorus Soldiers’ Chorus of the U.S. Army Field Band U.S. Navy Band Sea Chanters U.S. Air Force Singing Sergeants Armed Forces Color Guard and Service Color Teams by the Military District of D.C.

“Memorial Day is the most important holiday we have in this country because it allows us to have all of the other holidays” Mantegna said. “It’s great to have BBQs and watch the Indy 500 but if you carve out 90 minutes to watch the concert you’ll come away with that whole feeling of wow this is why this is a special day. You’ll have a greater appreciation.”

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley will deliver remarks Dennis Haysbert will remember the late Gen. Colin Powell Gil Birmingham will salute Vietnam veterans Jean Smart will join Mantegna to honor Gold Star families Mary McCormack will salute the women of World War II and Sinise will salute Medal of Honor recipients.

“I’ve had people tell me they never miss it it’s something they watch every year” Sinise said. “I’m in the military community all the time doing events support providing sources. A lot of our military members and families know about this concert. It’s very special to them. … Every year we say to each other at the end ‘That’s the best one we’ve ever done.'”

It truly is a year-round commitment for Sinise through the Gary Sinise Foundation.

“We started in 2011” Sinise said. “We’ve raised hundreds of millions of dollars from the generous American people who want us to pass that generosity on to the men and women who serve our country. … We build homes for our wounded provide services for Gold Star children who have lost a mom or dad in military service there’s just multiple initiatives.”

He also plays in the Lt. Dan Band named for his character in “Forrest Gump” (1994).

“It’s a wonderful story” Sinise said. “You meet somebody who really just wants to serve and be a great military leader he gets that cut out from under him losing his legs in battle dealing with post-traumatic stress … alcohol abuse … but he’s lifted again toward the end he’s successful moving on in life standing up on new legs and he’s going to make it.”

The happy ending made “Gump” unique compared to previous Vietnam War films.

“Most of the movies that had come out ‘The Deer Hunter’ ‘Coming Home’ ‘Casualties of War’ ‘Platoon’ ‘Apocalypse Now’ you don’t feel like the Vietnam veteran is going to be OK” Sinise said. “Along came ‘Forrest Gump’ and now we have a story of a Vietnam veteran who can put that all in perspective stand up again and move on in life.”

He wants our real-life service members to find that same inner peace.

“We want them to be like Lt. Dan to come home from war and feel OK and be alright.”

The epic world tour like so many was interrupted by the global pandemic but is finally back on the road. During that time Brian also battled multiple major health issues and has shared his incredible journey back to health with fans. After the thrilling opening night in Belfast on Friday garnered rave reviews the Queen icon admitted they were all feeling exhilarated but ""battle-scarred."" He posted a powerful new video for fans after the second show describing how he and the band were feeling but also revealing his greatest regret.

Brian spoke from the heart to the camera when he said it was just minutes after they had come off stage and they were all still feeling all the ""sweat and the pain"" of giving their all. In a written message he added: ""At this point everything (physically) hurts ! Because this show is at the limit of our collective energies - and something I’ve been training for all through the last 6 months. It’s right on the limit. But the inner glow of fulfilment is massively strong - hearing that roar of passion - feeling that energy - feeling that love. Knowing we have given EVERYTHING that we have in us for two hours twenty minutes of … something that you cannot describe.""

However Brian also talked about how the world has changed thanks to the pandemic – and robbed him and the band of one of their favourite things. He said: ""It’s been my regret on this tour already that I can’t do what I usually do which is meet people do meet and greets meet people at the stage door do autographs do pictures huddle up and stuff.

Musk was among many celebrities in attendance at the ceremony in St. Tropez joining Sean ""Diddy"" Combs Mark Wahlberg Tyler Perry Emily Ratajkowski and the groom's brother former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel 61 married fashion designer Sarah Staudinger 32 a little over a year after getting engaged.

The extravagant affair saw these celebrities mingle among each other following LD doing the honors of marrying the couple. Emanuel was previously married to Sarah Hardwick Addington with whom he shares three children.

Who is Ari Emanuel?

Emanuel the top executive of WME is known as the inspiration for fictional Hollywood agent Ari Gold from ""Entourage."" He is also the founder of Endeavor Talent Agency which owns half of the UFC and the Miss Universe pageant.

Emanuel has served as a member of Live Nation Entertainment board of directors since September 2007. Endeavor went public in 2021 and Emanuel owns a stake worth around $480 million.

Staudinger meanwhile is focused on expanding her fashion label Staud which she launched in 2015. Kendall Jenner Bella and Gigi Hadid Selena Gomez and Lizzo are some of the reported celebrities who are fans of Staud.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c3RsZS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9oYXJyeS1zdHlsZXMtZ3VuLXNhZmV0eS1kb25hdGlvbi11dmFsZGUtdGV4YXMtc2hvb3RpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harry Styles' Latest Call For Gun Safety Includes A Huge Donation To Everytown,"In the days following the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde Texas in which 19 students and two teachers were killed many celebrities joined the ongoing call for gun control — and on May 27 Harry Styles voiced his support for the cause too. “Along with all of you I have been absolutely devastated by the recent string of mass shootings in America culminating at the latest in Robb Elementary School in Uvalde Texas” the “As It Was” singer wrote in an Instagram post.

Styles announced that his tour would partner with Everytown for Gun Safety an organization dedicated to ending gun violence that is comprised of “more than 8 million mayors teachers survivors gun owners students and everyday Americans” per the official website. During Love on Tour he will be “donating to support their efforts and sharing their suggested action items” Styles continued. He also shared a gun violence statistic from the organization — that “firearms are the #1 leading cause of death for American children and teens.” (Styles’ fellow musicians Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez also encouraged their followers to support Everytown earlier in the week.)

So what will the donation look like? Live Nation announced that they would be matching the musician’s donation to the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund — which they wrote on Instagram amounts to “over $1 million and counting.”

As Styles pointed out in his post the Uvalde Texas shooting is the latest in a long series of mass shootings — including in Buffalo New York where 10 people were killed at a Tops grocery store May 14. There have already been 27 school shootings in the United States in 2022 according to Education Week.

Of course this isn’t the first time that Styles has shown his support for those working to end gun violence. In 2018 following the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida Styles posted a photo wearing a March For Our Lives T-shirt (and encouraged his followers to sign the group’s petition too). The march took place that day March 24 in Washington D.C. and he sent love from Oberhausen Germany.

That same year he sported an “End Gun Violence” sticker on his guitar during a show in Dallas Texas following an earlier school shooting in the state at Sante Fe High School where 10 people were killed.

It looks like Styles is going to keep speaking out as long as he has to — and he’s putting his money where his mouth is too."

Pete Mitchell takes an an experimental hypersonic plane called “The Darkstar” on an unauthorized test run. Those who’ve seen the trailer — or the movie at this point — will recall a low-flying triangular aircraft blowing past a lonely guard post on the desert floor. In a half-second the flyby literally blows the roof off the shack.

A flash of the scene in an early behind-the-scenes trailer set the aviation blogosphere aflutter — and not just because of the mind-blowing visual. The aircraft’s unusual shape raised eyebrows. Some posited that it could be the legendary SR-71 Blackbird once dubbed “the fastest plane ever.” Topping out at Mach 3 the high-altitude reconnaissance plane could literally outrun missiles shot at it by Russian MiGs.

’Top Gun: Maverick’ From Cannes To Theaters – Deadline’s Complete Coverage

Others guessed it could be something even more exotic: The near-mythical hypersonic SR-72 the Blackbird’s rumored descendant which is designed to fly at six times the speed of sound.

Lockheed Martin had uncharacteristically announced plans for the plane in 2013. Not much more was heard about the so-called “Son of Blackbird” until Lockheed confirmed engine tests in 2017. Some reports have maintained the SR-72 could be “rolled out for initial flight demonstrations by no later than 2023.” Lockheed in its original announcement claimed the game-changer could be operational by 2030. Oh and it pegged the development cost at $1 billion.

Not much more has ever been officially revealed about the SR-72. That along with its game-changing speed has only added to the plane’s mystique.

It was odd then that Lockheed CEO James Taiclet posted publicly on LinkedIn this month that the company’s ultra-secret Skunk Works which handles many of its most boundary-stretching projects including the SR-72 “partnered with Top Gun’s producers to bring cutting-edge future forward technology to the big screen” including tech around “hypersonic flight.” He also shared a photo of himself at the film’s premiere.

Lockheed Martin Director of Communications for Europe the Middle East and Africa John Neilson was even more explicit in a recent tweet writing “Rumours that Top Gun: Maverick in cinemas May 27 features a sneaky peek at what might be the @LockheedMartin SR-72 successor to super-impressive SR-71 Blackbird. This still photo from promotional materials seems to support that thinking.”

So is it the fabled “Son of Blackbird” that’s featured in Top Gun: Maverick? The answer is “sort of.”

Producer Jerry Bruckheimer told military blog Sandboxx News that director “Joe [Kosinski] worked with Skunk Works and Lockheed [Martin] to design the plane that’s in there.”

Kosinski revealed that details of the plane are indeed taken “out of real experimental aircraft” from Skunk Works.

“For me just being kind of an aviation buff and always loving that world the idea to give people a peek behind the curtain of secret projects…I worked with Skunk Works which is the division of Lockheed that actually makes these type of aircraft because I wanted it to feel as real as possible” he told Comic Book Movie.com this week. “So every detail of that is based on reality the way the aircraft functions the way it looks all the switches and stick are actually taken out of real experimental aircraft.”

And in the spirit of creating as many Top Gun: Maverick’s effects in the real world vs. the digital “We built a full-scale model a full-scale mock-up of the Darkstar aircraft that you see Maverick fly in the movie. Yeah I just wanted to show the audience that the first few minutes definitely feels like a Top Gun movie but once he gets in that jet I do also want you to know that we’re telling a whole new story and that sequence kind of helped set that tone up for the movie.”

A very good shot of the Darkstar is featured in Lady Gaga’s video for her song for the film “Hold My Hand.” See it below.

Maverick’s Darkstar in the hangar Vemo

“The reason it looks so real is because it was the engineers from Skunk Works who helped us design it” the director told Sandboxx News. “So those are the same people who are working on real aircraft.”

So did Cruise — or someone — actually fly a hypersonic plane for the film? The short answer is likely “No.”

Not only would the SR-72 — if a prototype actually exists — be prohibitively expensive to operate even on a blockbuster-level budget bringing such a plane itself out into the open would have national security implications.

To that point Bruckheimer made news earlier this month when he told Sandboxx that the Chinese government kept an eye on the plane used in the film.

“The Navy told us that a Chinese satellite turned and headed on a different route to photograph that plane. They thought it was real. That’s how real it looks.”

According to production documents obtained and verified as authentic by Deadline the scenes involving the Darkstar were scheduled to be shot between November 7 and 9 2018 out in the Mojave Desert at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake near Ridgecrest.

The Darkstar was filmed both inside and outside a hangar at China Lake including VFX plate shots and drone shots of the hypersonic clone rolling onto the tarmac. The plane was housed outside over night but under a “temporary hangar” likely frustrating interested parties overseas.

If it had been visible those interested parties might have noticed one crucial difference between what we know of the SR-72 and the plane that Cruise’s Capt. Pete Mitchell flies in the film: Lockheed’s plane is unmanned and has no windows which would be a problem for a wow-factor aircraft in a film about naval aviators. One other big difference is that the Darkstar being Tom Cruise’s plane goes to Mach 10.

For an even closer look at Maverick’s Darkstar inside and out here’s a video review of the expansion pack for it which was just released in Microsoft Flight Simulator.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc3VwZXJjYXJibG9uZGllLmNvbS9uYXNhLXg1OS1haXJjcmFmdC1sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tc2t1bmstd29ya3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Concorde with a silencer: NASA's X-59 brings back supersonic travel with no sonic boom – Supercar Blondie,"NASA’s experimental X-59 will break the sound barrier without causing a thunderous sonic boom.

If everything goes to plan the X-59 will bring back supersonic commercial flights – which are banned over land because of the insane noise they create.

The famous Concorde was only able to go supersonic over water on transoceanic flights because of the sonic boom it would make.

IMAGE: NASA

It was so fast it cut the flight time it takes to get from London to New York from eight hours down to three-and-a-half hours.

But when the Concorde fleet was grounded forever in 2003 ultra-fast commercial travel became a forgotten dream.

But NASA Quesst (that’s not a typo – the extra s is for “supersonic”) has created the X-59 – and the technology is unreal.

NASA says the X-59 will “dramatically reduce passenger air travel time” without being a burden to the people who live under flight paths.

The design of the aircraft means it can fly faster than sound but it only makes a sonic “thump”.

CHECK THIS OUT!

NASA says people on the ground may not even hear the “thump” at all.

The project also involves Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works in California.

Those are the maniacs who created the fastest plane ever – the SR-71 Blackbird.

IMAGE: NASA

When will the X-59 fly?

Scientists have been testing a scaled-down model in a wind tunnel and it’s been working really well.

So well that the first flight for the real aircraft is planned for late 2022.

But before then the NASA Quesst team need to do what’s called “ground testing”.

To do this the team has moved the X-59 from Lockheed Martin’s base in California to Texas.

The ground testing makes sure the aircraft can handle the loads and stresses it would face in a flight there’s a lot of energy at play when you break the sound barrier.

READ MORE: Bombardier’s $78 million private jet can ‘BREAK the sound barrier’

The team will also test the fuel systems before the X-59 is shipped back to California for the finishing touches of the build.

Then in 2024 the X-59 will be flown over actual communities to test the sonic thump and see how people react.

How does a sonic boom work?

When an aircraft breaks the sound barrier shockwaves are created.

These shockwaves merge as they push away from the aircraft and that is what causes the massive noise known as a sonic boom.

You can hear the noise for kilometers on either side of the flight path.

IMAGE: NASA

The X-59’s shape means the shockwaves still form but they never merge together.

So you only get a “gentle” thump.

The specs of the X-59

It’s a single-seat aircraft

It will cruise at an altitude of 16764m (55000 ft)

The cruise speed will be Mach 1.4 (1488km/h/ 925mph)

The aircraft is 30.3m (99.ft) long

The X-59 is 9m (29.5ft) wid

The Chervon Group (not to be confused with the energy company Chevron) is the owner of Flex Power Tools.

Who Is The Chervon Group?

Chervon is a global manufacturer out of China and its North American operations are based in Naperville Illinois. While we don’t have an exact number internet sources suggest it employs roughly 200 people in North America.

Chervon’s vision statement is:

“Better Tools. Better World.”

Its mission statement is:

“Providing superior products to users worldwide through continuous innovation we are determined to become a global leader in power tools and outdoor power equipment in the lithium-ion intelligent and digital era.”

In 2021 Cervon reported more than $1.7 billion in revenue with a profit of just under $150 million. Both represent significant increases over the previous three years and a trend of increasing sales and profit.

Today Chervon owns several well-known tool brands in North America including Flex EGO and Skil/Skilsaw. They also manufacture power tools for other brands.

Based on our experience with each of these brands we find they offer excellent quality and typically outperform competitor products at the same price point.

Chervon’s History of Owning Flex Power Tools

Flex as a power tool brand has been around for far longer than the 24V professional-grade tools you can buy at Lowe’s and other select manufacturers.

Flex tools with the red color scheme are the same brand and have been well-known in the automotive industry in particular. It made its first appearance in 1922 in Germany—100 years ago as we’re writing this! Among its many innovations Flex developed the world’s first handheld grinder with a flexible shaft back in 1954.

In 2013 the Chervon group acquired Flex.

Over the past several years Chervon has used Flex’s reputation for high-quality engineering and manufacturing to expand it into a more far-reaching 24V cordless system targeting professional contractors across multiple trades.

Just in the past two years we’ve seen Flex redefine the limits of core tools such as the hammer drill. We’ve seen the development of Stacked Lithium pouch cell batteries in higher capacity batteries than anyone has. With each new launch we consistently see technology innovation and design that attacks specific pain points or limits contractors find with other tools.

Unfortunately for the Brit the end result didn’t meet his Mugello expectations after a tangle with his teammate Tony Arbolino at turn two three laps to the end saw him crash out of fifth.

Lowes had shown his intentions from the first lap taking second position from Aron Canet at the downhill Savelli turn before running in podium contention as the race bedded in. Having dropped to the edge of the top six as the second half wound down the 31-year-old was regrouping and upping the pace once again before the teammates came together and he slid out.

“I’m gutted” Lowes said simply.

“It was an unfair end to a really good race considering the great work we did throughout the weekend.

”I had a good start and was showing some good pace. After the tough results in the last few races I felt confident enough to get a solid top five finish today. I didn’t deserve a finish like this.”

“I want to apologise to Sam and the team for what happened as I didn’t mean to harm anyone” Arbolino responded. “It was a long and intense race and at the time of the incident it was difficult for me to control the bike and I did everything possible to avoid falling and taking both of us off the track. But unfortunately the contact caused Sam to fall. It’s a real shame because after Le Mans we had both taken an important step forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZXh0cmEuaWUvMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9zcG9ydC9ydWdieS9qYW1lcy1sb3dlLWV2b2x1dGlvbi1pcmVsYW5kLWxlaW5zdGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How did written off James Lowe evolve into Leinster's greatest threat?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='extra.ie', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/05/28/sport/rugby/james-lowe-evolution-ireland-leinster (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533E7B8C70>, 'Connection to extra.ie timed out.

[Great Yarmouth Borough Council]

A £5.8m landscaping project will be a ""real refresh"" and complete the regeneration of a town centre according to a council.

The money will fund new paving lighting seating and trees around the new £5.2m market building in Great Yarmouth Norfolk which opened in 2023.

The money has come from government grants including the Future High Streets and Town Deal for which the authority had to bid through a competitive process.

Work is expected to start in early June and be completed by March 2025.

Great Yarmouth Borough Council chief executive Sheila Oxtoby said the work would complete the vision the authority set out more than five years ago.

""We're going to see a newly revised market place with new landscaping new planting a new lighting scheme new seating"" she said.

""It's going to be a real refresh and revitalisation of the market place.""

The council has given assurances that summer shopping disruption would be minimised and said delaying the work until the winter could increase costs.

Shoppers in Great Yarmouth broadly welcomed the improvements but some had reservations about whether it would bring regeneration.

One who did not wish to be named had been an employee at H Samuel's jewellery shop which closed it's branch in the town three years ago.

She said: ""I think they wasted too much money on it [the market].

""It looks nice but all they're going to do is make it look nicer and for what?

""I just don't think it's a good idea and I don't think we should be wasting taxpayers money.""

""Curly"" Jones 60 from Milton Keynes said: ""I think it's good. It needs to be tidy and feel nice and clean.""

Tina Goodman 78 from Ormesby ""Seems like an awful lot of money. But it needs sprucing up a bit smartening up.""

Her daughter Mandy 55 added: ""You need the shops to get the footfall. If they reduced the rates that would help.""

Caroline Read 63 from Leicester said she had visited the town's market since her childhood.

""To be honest I prefer the old market"" she said.

""But they've got to do something and you can't go backwards.

""It's a lot of money but you have to gamble in life to do something.""

Caroline Read and her partner Ian Ashton from Leicester said while they preferred the old market they accepted modernisation was needed [Andrew Turner/BBC]

Sex conversations are having a moment in Australia. There’s been a rise in women creating racy content online and it has led to plenty of chatter about modern sexuality trends and kinks.

Now four creators have revealed what men are still getting wrong about sex in 2024 and why the most common mistake is an exclusively Aussie issue.

Alicia Davis who was a correctional officer bringing home $1100 per week before she became an X-rated creator via a subscription service said Aussie men can be quite “egotistical” when it comes to sex.

Davis 31 said they’re often far too eager to rush in which can ruin the experience.

“They think it’s all about getting in and getting the job done rather than the little things that can add to the moment.”

She explained that many don’t care if a woman is satisfied as long as they are.

Davis went as far to say that European men are better in bed.

“Whenever I’ve slept with an Irish or British guy they have been much more communicative and sensual. It makes a world of difference” she argued.

Similarly creator Annie Knight 26 who previously went viral for revealing that she’d slept with 300 people in the past 12 months said Aussie men tend to have a “jump straight in” approach to sex which isn’t ideal.

“What they don’t understand is you have to go slowly. Start by kissing and light touching” she said.

Kay Manuel who is also an X-rated creator said the issue is once again that Aussie men “rush” to reach the finish.

Manuel said this can often lead to women “faking it” because they want to appease men who aren’t making enough effort.

One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending.

The international money laundering ring operated by exploiting the flight crew’s “trusted positions” and airport security privileges according to a complaint filed by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

US officials said the investigation had “exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry” and shone a light on the methods employed by drug traffickers.

Charlie Hernandez 42 Sarah Valerio Pujols 42 Emmanuel Torres 34 and Jarol Fabio 35 were arrested by agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New York on Tuesday.

They are accused of taking a cut of each shipment they smuggled through airport security checkpoints and onto flights bound for the Dominican Republic.

Prosecutors said the flight attendants who worked on different international airlines that flew between the two destinations smuggled approximately $8m in cash from the sale of drugs such as fentanyl over several years.

Code word ‘lotions’

They allegedly used the code word “lotions” to mean drug proceeds and referred to the smuggling ring’s drug-dealing clients as “los tigres”.

The flight crew all had a special clearance with the US Transport Security Administration which permitted them to go through a designated security lane at John F Kennedy International Airport with less scrutiny than normal passengers.

All four flight attendants have been charged with one count each relating to unlicensed money transmission which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

They have also been charged with one count each of violating airport security requirements which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

Mr Hernandez of West New York in New Jersey and Ms Pujols from the Bronx in New York were additionally charged with a conspiracy count which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Ms Pujols faces a further charge relating to bulk cash smuggling which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Ivan J Arvelo the HSI special agent overseeing the case said: “This investigation has exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry and has illuminated methods that narcotics traffickers are utilising.”"

In the fall of 2019 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hired a helicopter equipped with a leak-detecting infrared camera to criss-cross the Permian Basin looking for gaseous emissions part of a monitoring program undertaken at the behest of and in partnership with the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED). Over the course of nine days the EPA found leaking valves leaking hatches unlit and partially lit gas flares on wells leaking tank batteries and compressor stations. In all the flights documented 111 emissions at facilities run by 24 different oil and gas companies.

In 2020 the EPA did it again this time undertaking 15 days of flights and expanding their range to include part of the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico. They found 244 facilities emitting gases. At least one site had five separate emission sources. Then in March of this year the EPA issued consent agreements with 11 companies — some of the biggest producers in the country including Chevron ConocoPhillips and Occidental — for violations of the Clean Air Act based on the 2019 flights. Yet under those agreements two and a half years in the making only one company was fined for environmental violations despite the fact that all of the companies were cited for “directly releasing emissions to atmosphere.” The EPA fined another company for a paperwork violation.

Chisholm Energy (purchased by Earthstone Energy in December) operated three wells drilled without proper state permits and received a $162385 fine. All three wells had multiple leaks which were not noted in the settlement. BTA Oil Producers received a $75500 fine for operating two unregistered leaking wells. Based on estimates from the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division those wells produced oil and gas worth roughly $17 million for Chisholm and $30 million for BTA since they began production in 2018. The other 21 operators of leaking wells weren’t fined anything at all.

The Permian Basin where the majority of the flights took place isn’t much to look at. It’s 75000 square miles of mostly flat mostly treeless scrubland straddling the Texas-New Mexico border. This one-time ranchland is now the nation’s most productive oil and gas field with more than 38000 active wells and associated facilities just on the New Mexico side. But that wealth of resources comes at a cost. Recent studies show that Permian wells emit much more methane — a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO2 in its first 20 years in the atmosphere — than previously thought a finding backed up by new reporting requirements from the state’s Oil Conservation Division. Operators themselves are reporting dramatically more venting flaring and leaks than ever. And that’s on top of the unreported releases documented by the EPA flights.ere conducted in 2021.

All of these emissions fuel climate change which poses a deep and immediate threat to New Mexico. Massive forest fires supercharged by long-term aridification have charred more than a half-million acres across the state already this year months before the usual start of fire season. This includes the largest single fire in the state’s recorded history. The need for proper monitoring and crackdowns on violators could hardly be more pressing but the EPA has been slow in enforcement. Its recent consent agreements cover only what the agency found on the first round of flights. According to an EPA spokesperson the 2020 flights are still being assessed a year and a half after they concluded. No flights were conducted in 2021.

The EPA spokesperson also says that the agency can’t disclose the companies in the 2020 assessments because the investigations are ongoing. But a comparison of coordinates of the 2020 leaks provided by NMED with a list of the state’s oil and gas wells shows that 10 of the 11 companies cited in 2019 again had leaks in 2020 including Chisholm and BTA. Those leaks were sometimes at the exact same sites as shown in 2019 and 2020 videos of a site operated by Chisholm.

But it’s not clear what the EPA will do about what it found in 2020 — those flights happened before the EPA began notifying operators of the previous year’s violations.

It’s also not clear why the EPA didn’t fine companies for their violations of the Clean Air Act. After days of costly helicopter flights infrared camera rentals and more than two years of office and inspection work confirming that the companies had vented unknown amounts of methane and other gases into the atmosphere the EPA wrote to most of the companies: “Upon review EPA hereby confirms that you have completed all requirements … satisfactorily.”

No fines. No punishment. According to EPA documents the companies simply fixed the leaks and pledged not to do it again.

NMED Secretary James Kenney who requested the flights in the first place thinks that’s unlikely to happen.

“Unless there is significant deterrence there’s no change in behavior” he says. “And what you want to see from an enforcement program is a change in behavior.”

The above videos show EPA infrared footage of the same tank battery operated by Chisholm Energy in 2019 (top) and 2020. The black wispy clouds are escaping gases that led to the EPA’s Clean Air Act violation notice to the company.

Kenney asks to meet in person at NMED’s Albuquerque office to discuss the EPA flights. It’s a surprise he has the time: His agency is about to implement historic new clean car rules while simultaneously monitoring the environmental fallout of the colossal wildfires but he wants to be sure that NMED’s commitment to monitoring gaseous emissions is clear. Kenney is tall and rangy and he answers questions directly. The environmental engineer in him fills those replies with detailed background information and he taps the table when he’s making a point.

He also loves to talk about getting his hands dirty in his early years as an inspector. “I’ve climbed things gone under things grabbed samples of things” he says. “Had a shotgun pulled on me one day.”

At an oil site? “It was actually a dry cleaner” he says. “I probably should have just left but I stayed.”

Soon after New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took office in 2019 she hired Kenney to lead NMED. He had spent the previous 19 years working enforcement cases at the EPA often targeting the oil and gas industry in other parts of the country. Now the two wanted to undo eight years of neglect and chronic underfunding in the department by the previous administration of Republican Gov. Susana Martinez and then-NMED Secretary Ryan Flynn. The latter left his state office in 2016 to become the head of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association the state’s most prominent lobbying and interest group.

“It’s taken me three years to get to this point where I feel like we should have been in 2019” Kenney says. “We’re still cleaning up the prior administration’s problems.”

One of the first things he did was call a group with the resources and expertise to investigate some of the largest most powerful companies in the country: his former employer — the EPA.

“In the Martinez administration EPA wasn’t allowed in New Mexico” Kenney says. “In the Lujan Grisham administration the first thing we did is invite EPA in.”

Together the EPA and NMED set up what would become the 2019 and 2020 aerial programs to find leaks and emissions at oil and gas wells and other facilities and then prosecute offenders for violations they found. While Kenney won’t discuss details he says that the EPA’s toothless consent decrees don’t mean that prosecution is out of the question for offending companies. He says that NMED has several oil and gas producers on its prosecution radar based on the overflights and he hopes to be able to announce them by the end of this summer.

If that also seems even slower than the EPA that’s because it is.

Kenney takes pains to point out that while the feds have the money and staff to hire helicopters and track down systemic corporate offenders no one knows New Mexico wells and production better than the air quality inspectors in his office. Problem is Kenney has been able to keep only three of seven positions filled. Except for when someone quits and only two are filled. And there is only one lawyer to vet and write cases against offending oil and gas companies. In the last legislative session Kenney made waves as he fought for more positions and increased salaries for the people who keep an eye on the petroleum industry in the state — to little avail.

“We can’t deliver on everything given the budget that the Legislature gives us. We just can’t” Kenney says.

So when it comes to the state prosecuting fossil fuel operators “It’s dreadfully slow” he says.

And that’s why he invited the EPA to New Mexico. It has people money an ongoing oil and gas aerial monitoring program — and the ability to prosecute and fine companies that operate in violation of the Clean Air Act.

But to this point it hasn’t.

Of the 111 leaks from 24 companies that the EPA recorded that first year the agency acted on just 27 infractions by 11 companies.

When asked why Kenney said: Ask the EPA. “I’d be curious how they answer it.”

As of publication the EPA hasn’t answered.

* * *

Even some of the offending companies were expecting a penalty. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded companies to inform shareholders of impending legal matters and sizable fines and five of the 11 that received violation notices listed the EPA violations in their quarterly and annual SEC filings.

The wording differed from company to company but the gist of all was similar to what Marathon Oil told its shareholders in a quarterly financial report from September 2021. “In January 2020 we received a Notice of Violation from the EPA related to the Clean Air Act” the company reported. “However we believe that any penalties mitigation costs or corrective actions that may result from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows.”

According to the EPA website the agency could have assessed a penalty of up to $25000 a day up to a total of $200000 for each infraction with penalties doubled for subsequent convictions. That may seem like small potatoes to a large corporation but multiple violations can add up. Marathon Oil had to prepare its shareholders for that eventuality. But in the end the company suffered no adverse effects at all. Five months after issuing the notice of violation the EPA sent Marathon Oil a final notice closing its case without one dollar in fines.

Kayley Shoup knew about the EPA flights and as the Carlsbad-based director of Citizens Caring for the Future did her best to follow up on their findings. Over the past year she has traveled around the Permian Basin with field workers from the environmental group Earthworks looking at wells and facilities with their own infrared camera spotting emissions and reporting them to NMED. They used the EPA flight data to choose which wells to check among the tens of thousands in the region.

“We could check maybe four of those in a given day” she says. “And the ones that were emitting when [the EPA] flew over were still emitting.”

But Shoup didn’t know that the EPA had found leaks but closed most of the investigations without penalties.

“I’m not shocked” she says “but that’s horrifying.”

Last year the state developed new rules to reduce so-called ozone precursors — airborne chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOC) that contribute to ozone pollution and smog. The regulations which will likely receive their final approval and implementation from NMED’s governing board this month require producers to stop leaks of ozone-causing chemicals from oil and gas wells. The rules have the added effect of penalizing operators whose wells emit methane a fellow traveler of the ozone precursors.

The rules were triggered in part by seven New Mexico counties on an air pollution watchlist. They are within 95% of the maximum ozone level allowed by the EPA. Of those counties one contains a suburb of Albuquerque the state’s largest city and another contains Las Cruces the second-largest city. The other five counties encompass the state’s two oil and gas producing regions — including Eddy County where Shoup lives.

“Clearly this has impacts” she says. Shoup knows families with endocrine issues reproductive issues a family with a premature baby. As with so many diseases there are no definable single causes but “these people live basically right in the middle of the oil field” where the air smells of oil gas and other VOCs.

In light of this her group is trying to get indoor air purifiers that filter VOCs from people’s homes. She says it’s a new idea that will take a lot of time as well as money that people don’t have. “But you know we are trying to start it.”

Shoup talked just after driving down state highway 285 between Artesia and Carlsbad through one of the more productive — and destructive — regions of the Permian Basin. On the east side of the highway was a mature oilfield. On the other side companies are drilling new wells in a gas field and the air is banked in smog.

“It looks like Los Angeles” she says “but like 10 times worse and dusty and disgusting.”

* * *

Kenney is trying to fix that.

“It is excruciatingly painful to have the information the evidence the understanding of environmental impact the understanding that our ozone levels are getting worse the understanding that communities are affected” he says.

He says it slowly and carefully to drive the point home.

“I know how to do this and my only Achilles heel is resources right now” Kenney says. “We don’t have the resources to be the regulator that people expect us to be.”

His department is trying out new technology that can do the work of several on-the-ground inspectors. He talks of working with Sceye to deploy High-Altitude Platform Stations (aka automated blimps) to monitor methane and other leaks in the state’s oil and gas fields in unprecedented detail and in real time. He also says NMED recently tested a car outfitted with a sniffer that can immediately detect methane and other VOCs in the surrounding air. But the systems aren’t deployed yet.

“I am very clear about my role on enforcement and it’s shaped by 20-plus years of working these cases” Kenney says.

“I am not just making shit up” he says tapping the table. “I have a plan.”

Part of that plan is continuing to work with the EPA — and continuing to press for enforcement. The agency conducted another round of monitoring flights earlier this year. Details of those flights are not yet available even to Kenney. Again he suggests asking the EPA.

The EPA didn’t respond to questions about the 2022 flight program — nor to questions about the pace of prosecutions why so few companies were singled out for violation letters or why companies weren’t fined for violating the Clean Air Act one of the agency’s signature duties. Since the federal overflight program began New Mexico has implemented tougher oil and gas emission regulations but without a parallel increase in enforcement staffing. It’s not clear if additional federal monitoring will effectively fill the gap.

In late April the EPA did send out its first two violation letters from the 2020 flights. One went to Murchison Oil and Gas for a pair of leaking wells. The other went to Occidental Petroleum which received a notice in 2019 for a leaking valve on a tank battery. In 2020 the new letter reveals the EPA found leaks at nine Occidental sites including multiple leaks at the same tank battery. To date the EPA has not issued any fines to Occidental for those emissions.

Trading activity was muted due to a public holiday in the United States.

The Brent crude futures contract for July which will expire on Tuesday settled up $2.24 or 1.9% at $121.67 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up $1.99 or 1.7% to $117.06 a barrel at 18.03 GMT extending solid gains made last week.

""One reason being cited for this is the imminent lifting of coronavirus restrictions in Shanghai which is sparking hopes that oil demand will pick up again in China"" analysts at Commerzbank said in a note to clients.

Shanghai announced an end to its two-month-long COVID-19 lockdown and will allow the vast majority of people in China's largest city to leave their homes and drive their cars from Wednesday.

Meanwhile the EU is meeting on Monday and Tuesday to discuss a sixth package of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine which Moscow calls a ""special military operation.""

""Europe has been haggling about this for the better part of a month but increasingly the market is pricing (additional sanctions) in as a risk"" said Daniel Ghali senior commodity strategist at TD Securities in Toronto.

EU countries failed to agree on a Russian oil import ban despite last-minute haggling before the summit got under way in Brussels. But leaders of the 27 EU countries will agree in principle to an oil embargo a draft of their summit conclusions showed while leaving the practical details and hard decisions until later.

Any further ban on Russian oil would tighten a crude market already strained for supply amid rising demand for gasoline diesel and jet fuel ahead of the peak summer demand season in the United States and Europe.

Underscoring market tightness the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia a group dubbed OPEC+ are set to rebuff Western calls to speed up increases in output when they meet on Thursday.

They will stick to existing plans to raise their July output target by 432000 barrels per day six OPEC+ sources told Reuters.

In the fall of 2019 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hired a helicopter equipped with a leak-detecting infrared camera to criss-cross the Permian Basin looking for gaseous emissions part of a monitoring program undertaken at the behest of and in partnership with the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED). Over the course of nine days the EPA found leaking valves leaking hatches unlit and partially lit gas flares on wells leaking tank batteries and compressor stations. In all the flights documented 111 emissions at facilities run by 24 different oil and gas companies.

In 2020 the EPA did it again this time undertaking 15 days of flights and expanding their range to include part of the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico. They found 244 facilities emitting gases. At least one site had five separate emission sources. Then in March of this year the EPA issued consent agreements with 11 companies — some of the biggest producers in the country including Chevron ConocoPhillips and Occidental — for violations of the Clean Air Act based on the 2019 flights. Yet under those agreements two and a half years in the making only one company was fined for environmental violations despite the fact that all of the companies were cited for “directly releasing emissions to atmosphere.” The EPA fined another company for a paperwork violation.

Chisholm Energy (purchased by Earthstone Energy in December) operated three wells drilled without proper state permits and received a $162385 fine. All three wells had multiple leaks which were not noted in the settlement. BTA Oil Producers received a $75500 fine for operating two unregistered leaking wells. Based on estimates from the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division those wells produced oil and gas worth roughly $17 million for Chisholm and $30 million for BTA since they began production in 2018. The other 21 operators of leaking wells weren’t fined anything at all.

The Permian Basin where the majority of the flights took place isn’t much to look at. It’s 75000 square miles of mostly flat mostly treeless scrubland straddling the Texas-New Mexico border. This one-time ranchland is now the nation’s most productive oil and gas field with more than 38000 active wells and associated facilities just on the New Mexico side. But that wealth of resources comes at a cost. Recent studies show that Permian wells emit much more methane — a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO2 in its first 20 years in the atmosphere — than previously thought a finding backed up by new reporting requirements from the state’s Oil Conservation Division. Operators themselves are reporting dramatically more venting flaring and leaks than ever. And that’s on top of the unreported releases documented by the EPA flights.ere conducted in 2021.

All of these emissions fuel climate change which poses a deep and immediate threat to New Mexico. Massive forest fires supercharged by long-term aridification have charred more than a half-million acres across the state already this year months before the usual start of fire season. This includes the largest single fire in the state’s recorded history. The need for proper monitoring and crackdowns on violators could hardly be more pressing but the EPA has been slow in enforcement. Its recent consent agreements cover only what the agency found on the first round of flights. According to an EPA spokesperson the 2020 flights are still being assessed a year and a half after they concluded. No flights were conducted in 2021.

The EPA spokesperson also says that the agency can’t disclose the companies in the 2020 assessments because the investigations are ongoing. But a comparison of coordinates of the 2020 leaks provided by NMED with a list of the state’s oil and gas wells shows that 10 of the 11 companies cited in 2019 again had leaks in 2020 including Chisholm and BTA. Those leaks were sometimes at the exact same sites as shown in 2019 and 2020 videos of a site operated by Chisholm.

But it’s not clear what the EPA will do about what it found in 2020 — those flights happened before the EPA began notifying operators of the previous year’s violations.

It’s also not clear why the EPA didn’t fine companies for their violations of the Clean Air Act. After days of costly helicopter flights infrared camera rentals and more than two years of office and inspection work confirming that the companies had vented unknown amounts of methane and other gases into the atmosphere the EPA wrote to most of the companies: “Upon review EPA hereby confirms that you have completed all requirements … satisfactorily.”

No fines. No punishment. According to EPA documents the companies simply fixed the leaks and pledged not to do it again.

NMED Secretary James Kenney who requested the flights in the first place thinks that’s unlikely to happen.

“Unless there is significant deterrence there’s no change in behavior” he says. “And what you want to see from an enforcement program is a change in behavior.”

The above videos show EPA infrared footage of the same tank battery operated by Chisholm Energy in 2019 (top) and 2020. The black wispy clouds are escaping gases that led to the EPA’s Clean Air Act violation notice to the company.

* * *

Kenney asks to meet in person at NMED’s Albuquerque office to discuss the EPA flights. It’s a surprise he has the time: His agency is about to implement historic new clean car rules while simultaneously monitoring the environmental fallout of the colossal wildfires but he wants to be sure that NMED’s commitment to monitoring gaseous emissions is clear. Kenney is tall and rangy and he answers questions directly. The environmental engineer in him fills those replies with detailed background information and he taps the table when he’s making a point.

He also loves to talk about getting his hands dirty in his early years as an inspector. “I’ve climbed things gone under things grabbed samples of things” he says. “Had a shotgun pulled on me one day.”

At an oil site? “It was actually a dry cleaner” he says. “I probably should have just left but I stayed.”

Soon after New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took office in 2019 she hired Kenney to lead NMED. He had spent the previous 19 years working enforcement cases at the EPA often targeting the oil and gas industry in other parts of the country. Now the two wanted to undo eight years of neglect and chronic underfunding in the department by the previous administration of Republican Gov. Susana Martinez and then-NMED Secretary Ryan Flynn. The latter left his state office in 2016 to become the head of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association the state’s most prominent lobbying and interest group.

“It’s taken me three years to get to this point where I feel like we should have been in 2019” Kenney says. “We’re still cleaning up the prior administration’s problems.”

One of the first things he did was call a group with the resources and expertise to investigate some of the largest most powerful companies in the country: his former employer — the EPA.

“In the Martinez administration EPA wasn’t allowed in New Mexico” Kenney says. “In the Lujan Grisham administration the first thing we did is invite EPA in.”

Together the EPA and NMED set up what would become the 2019 and 2020 aerial programs to find leaks and emissions at oil and gas wells and other facilities and then prosecute offenders for violations they found. While Kenney won’t discuss details he says that the EPA’s toothless consent decrees don’t mean that prosecution is out of the question for offending companies. He says that NMED has several oil and gas producers on its prosecution radar based on the overflights and he hopes to be able to announce them by the end of this summer.

If that also seems even slower than the EPA that’s because it is.

Kenney takes pains to point out that while the feds have the money and staff to hire helicopters and track down systemic corporate offenders no one knows New Mexico wells and production better than the air quality inspectors in his office. Problem is Kenney has been able to keep only three of seven positions filled. Except for when someone quits and only two are filled. And there is only one lawyer to vet and write cases against offending oil and gas companies. In the last legislative session Kenney made waves as he fought for more positions and increased salaries for the people who keep an eye on the petroleum industry in the state — to little avail.

“We can’t deliver on everything given the budget that the Legislature gives us. We just can’t” Kenney says.

So when it comes to the state prosecuting fossil fuel operators “It’s dreadfully slow” he says.

And that’s why he invited the EPA to New Mexico. It has people money an ongoing oil and gas aerial monitoring program — and the ability to prosecute and fine companies that operate in violation of the Clean Air Act.

But to this point it hasn’t.

Of the 111 leaks from 24 companies that the EPA recorded that first year the agency acted on just 27 infractions by 11 companies.

When asked why Kenney said: Ask the EPA. “I’d be curious how they answer it.”

As of publication the EPA hasn’t answered.

* * *

Even some of the offending companies were expecting a penalty. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded companies to inform shareholders of impending legal matters and sizable fines and five of the 11 that received violation notices listed the EPA violations in their quarterly and annual SEC filings.

The wording differed from company to company but the gist of all was similar to what Marathon Oil told its shareholders in a quarterly financial report from September 2021. “In January 2020 we received a Notice of Violation from the EPA related to the Clean Air Act” the company reported. “However we believe that any penalties mitigation costs or corrective actions that may result from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows.”

According to the EPA website the agency could have assessed a penalty of up to $25000 a day up to a total of $200000 for each infraction with penalties doubled for subsequent convictions. That may seem like small potatoes to a large corporation but multiple violations can add up. Marathon Oil had to prepare its shareholders for that eventuality. But in the end the company suffered no adverse effects at all. Five months after issuing the notice of violation the EPA sent Marathon Oil a final notice closing its case without one dollar in fines.

Kayley Shoup knew about the EPA flights and as the Carlsbad-based director of Citizens Caring for the Future did her best to follow up on their findings. Over the past year she has traveled around the Permian Basin with field workers from the environmental group Earthworks looking at wells and facilities with their own infrared camera spotting emissions and reporting them to NMED. They used the EPA flight data to choose which wells to check among the tens of thousands in the region.

“We could check maybe four of those in a given day” she says. “And the ones that were emitting when [the EPA] flew over were still emitting.”

But Shoup didn’t know that the EPA had found leaks but closed most of the investigations without penalties.

“I’m not shocked” she says “but that’s horrifying.”

Last year the state developed new rules to reduce so-called ozone precursors — airborne chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOC) that contribute to ozone pollution and smog. The regulations which will likely receive their final approval and implementation from NMED’s governing board this month require producers to stop leaks of ozone-causing chemicals from oil and gas wells. The rules have the added effect of penalizing operators whose wells emit methane a fellow traveler of the ozone precursors.

The rules were triggered in part by seven New Mexico counties on an air pollution watchlist. They are within 95% of the maximum ozone level allowed by the EPA. Of those counties one contains a suburb of Albuquerque the state’s largest city and another contains Las Cruces the second-largest city. The other five counties encompass the state’s two oil and gas producing regions — including Eddy County where Shoup lives.

“Clearly this has impacts” she says. Shoup knows families with endocrine issues reproductive issues a family with a premature baby. As with so many diseases there are no definable single causes but “these people live basically right in the middle of the oil field” where the air smells of oil gas and other VOCs.

In light of this her group is trying to get indoor air purifiers that filter VOCs from people’s homes. She says it’s a new idea that will take a lot of time as well as money that people don’t have. “But you know we are trying to start it.”

Shoup talked just after driving down state highway 285 between Artesia and Carlsbad through one of the more productive — and destructive — regions of the Permian Basin. On the east side of the highway was a mature oilfield. On the other side companies are drilling new wells in a gas field and the air is banked in smog.

“It looks like Los Angeles” she says “but like 10 times worse and dusty and disgusting.”

* * *

Kenney is trying to fix that.

“It is excruciatingly painful to have the information the evidence the understanding of environmental impact the understanding that our ozone levels are getting worse the understanding that communities are affected” he says.

He says it slowly and carefully to drive the point home.

“I know how to do this and my only Achilles heel is resources right now” Kenney says. “We don’t have the resources to be the regulator that people expect us to be.”

His department is trying out new technology that can do the work of several on-the-ground inspectors. He talks of working with Sceye to deploy High-Altitude Platform Stations (aka automated blimps) to monitor methane and other leaks in the state’s oil and gas fields in unprecedented detail and in real time. He also says NMED recently tested a car outfitted with a sniffer that can immediately detect methane and other VOCs in the surrounding air. But the systems aren’t deployed yet.

“I am very clear about my role on enforcement and it’s shaped by 20-plus years of working these cases” Kenney says.

“I am not just making shit up” he says tapping the table. “I have a plan.”

Part of that plan is continuing to work with the EPA — and continuing to press for enforcement. The agency conducted another round of monitoring flights earlier this year. Details of those flights are not yet available even to Kenney. Again he suggests asking the EPA.

The EPA didn’t respond to questions about the 2022 flight program — nor to questions about the pace of prosecutions why so few companies were singled out for violation letters or why companies weren’t fined for violating the Clean Air Act one of the agency’s signature duties. Since the federal overflight program began New Mexico has implemented tougher oil and gas emission regulations but without a parallel increase in enforcement staffing. It’s not clear if additional federal monitoring will effectively fill the gap.

In late April the EPA did send out its first two violation letters from the 2020 flights. One went to Murchison Oil and Gas for a pair of leaking wells. The other went to Occidental Petroleum which received a notice in 2019 for a leaking valve on a tank battery. In 2020 the new letter reveals the EPA found leaks at nine Occidental sites including multiple leaks at the same tank battery. To date the EPA has not issued any fines to Occidental for those emissions.

Senate Buck Newton is Wilson County’s only 2022 legislative primary candidate who’s already shown the fundraising prowess of a seasoned incumbent.







Political action committees Republican legislators and statewide business leaders poured money into Newton’s campaign coffers which swelled by $102827 from January through April for an election cycle total of $160727 as of May 16 the day before Newton won the GOP primary for Senate District 4.

Newton defeated Joe Democko a Goldsboro chiropractor and former Wayne County school board member with nearly 68% of the vote.

Democko raised $40246 in the first quarter amassing more than $140386 heading into Election Day. Campaign finance reports show the bulk of Democko’s war chest was a $100000 loan he made to his own campaign.

With $76766.40 in cash on hand at the close of North Carolina’s first quarter plus reporting period which covers the first four months of the year Newton starts his general election race with a substantial head start over Democratic state Sen. Toby Fitch who raised just $19210 and had $18968.38 left over heading into the primary.

Before the May 17 primary narrowed the field Senate District 4 candidates raised a combined total of more than $333000.

In N.C. House District 24 Republican candidate Ken Fontenot collected $17877 from January through April and has raised $23537 overall as of May 10 the deadline for submitting first quarter reports to the N.C. State Board of Elections. His Democratic opponent Rep. Linda Cooper-Suggs received $2602.70 in the first four months of 2022 which accounts for all of her campaign’s fundraising in the election cycle thus far.

Both candidates can expect considerable support from their parties’ major donors but since neither faced a primary opponent the District 24 money race has only just begun.

FIGHTING FOR FITCH

Wilson County’s two-term incumbent state senator held off a primary challenge from Rep. Raymond E. Smith Jr. D-Wayne on a shoestring budget.

Fitch raised $18460 in the first four months of the year for a total of $19210 in the 2022 election cycle. His opponent collected $12685 from January through April a sum that matched Smith’s overall total.

Fitch received a combined $3600 from U.S. Rep. G.K. Butterfield’s congressional campaign. Butterfield endorsed Fitch his longtime friend and former law partner in the waning days of the primary campaign. Other notable donors include a half dozen PACs state Sen. Paul Lowe of Forsyth County Wilson insurance agency owners John Hackney and Dewey Sheffield and Rochelle Small-Toney Rocky Mount’s former city manager.

The company has announced the signing of the Royalton Splash Riviera Cancun to its all-inclusive portfolio with plans to open at the end of this year.

The property is owned and managed by Blue Diamond Resorts; it will join the fast-expanding All-Inclusive by Marriott Bonvoy portfolio which now includes almost 30 properties in the Caribbean and Latin America.

It’s yet another addition to Marriott’s major push in to what is easily the hottest concept in the travel industry particularly in the Caribbean: all-inclusive.

“We are thrilled to continue working with Blue Diamond Resorts to add another exciting all-inclusive resort to the All-Inclusive by Marriott Bonvoy portfolio” said Laurent de Kousemaeker Chief Development Officer Caribbean and Latin America Marriott International. “The Autograph Collection Hotels brand champions individuality with each hotel being a product of passion making this brand an exceptional fit for this significant project and the other 20 Blue Diamond Resorts that have joined the collection.”

The 1049-room hotel which also includes a waterpark will have amenities like a theater a bowling alley 12 different dining concepts and nine bars.

It’s the latest step in the two companies’ growing alliance; last year Marriott announced a long-term agreement with Blue Diamond that added 20 hotels in the region to the Marriott all-inclusive portfolio.

Marriott’s current all-inclusive resorts are located in Antigua Barbados Costa Rica the Dominican Republic Grenada Jamaica Mexico and Saint Lucia.

“We are excited for Royalton Splash Riviera Cancun to join Marriott’s Autograph Collection brand” said Jordi Pelfort President of Hotels and Resorts at Sunwing Travel Group Blue Diamond’s parent company. “Today’s announcement reinforces Blue Diamond’s position as one of the fastest growing hotel chains in the Caribbean.”

President Ratu Wiliame Katonivere made the commendation during the official opening of the refurbished Sheraton Fiji Golf & Beach Resort in Nadi on Friday.

“At the outset allow me to congratulate the Fiji National Provident Fund the proud owners of this beautifully upgraded resort” Ratu Wiliame said.

“The vision and the decision to purchase two iconic Denarau resorts in 2018 and the additional investments to refurbish this hotel are indeed magnificent.

“It is evidence of the organisation’s commitment to building for the future of its members’ interest.”

Ratu Wiliame said the refurbishment project created activity and confidence in the local tourism sector when borders were closed and at a time when the economy was contracting.

The president mentioned that the Sheraton Fiji Golf and Beach Resort continued to provide employment to as many as 600 people and offered innovative guest programs undertook community engagement and contributed to sustainable efforts.

“Importantly this fine establishment is 100 per cent local well done to FNPF.”

Ratu Wiliame also congratulated the management of Marriott International for the back-to-back opening of three world-class Sheraton resorts since March 16.

He added the resilience of Fijians and the collaborative true ‘duavata’ spirit across all sectors was just remarkable and that resilience helped us navigate the pandemic."

The confidence is buoyed by recent revelations by the Financial Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism that New York-based insurance broker Marsh McLennan will come on board as the insurance arranger. This brought optimism after global insurers Swiss Re AXA and Zurich last year declined to cover the $5 billion pipeline that has faced a fierce campaign from climate and environmental activists who describe it as “toxic”.

In March reports showed that Eacop’s promoters TotalEnergies were banking on European and Asian export credit agencies to provide a financial guarantee for the project to bring on board commercial banks to provide loans.

Officials in Kampala are guarded on which financiers are involved but indicate that the wheels are starting to turn.

Negative campaigns

Eacop deputy managing director John Bosco Habumugisha said that potential lenders had travelled to Uganda and Tanzania to evaluate the project and that the authorities will announce the financiers within two months.

“What I can say is that we have very many entities that are willing to fund the project” he said on May 19 while giving an update on Eacop’s execution in Kampala.

Insiders say arranging Eacop’s financing has been a “headache” a “slow and complex process” due to the environment concerns and negative campaign by climate activists.

“It has been difficult” a source said.

“Every time something is said or written about this project a financier drops out.”

The project financial advisors are Standard Bank of South Africa through its Uganda subsidiary Stanbic Chinese giant Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (which owns a 40 percent stake in Standard Bank) and Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.

A fortnight ago climate activist Dominika Lasota confronted France President Emmanuel Macron in Brussels asking him to denounce Eacop cut off support and stop the project in which the French major TotalEnergies holds a 62 percent stake.

Such campaigns have seen major lenders desert the company as the push for clean energy sources gains currency.

“Total and allies were in a hurry to announce their final investment decision in early February this year. Since then the list of banks and insurers staying away from Eacop has been growing” Omar Elmawi the coordinator of the #StopEacop Coalition said last week.

Last week alone five banks — Deutsche Bank Citi JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley — confirmed they would not finance the Eacop. Insurer Beazley Group and the Italian export credit agency SACE also opted out.

Another 13 banks — including two TotalEnergies’ traditional lenders — abandoned the French giant-headlined project between 2020 and 2021 but experts argue that there is a way back in for some of these lenders if Total is on course for a low-carbon transition.

TotalEnergies said in its 2021 presentation to shareholders that for the Lake Albert project it has set a carbon intensity target of 13 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of crude oil produced (13kgCO2/boe).

Globally carbon intensity for crude oil ranges from 10.1-72.1kgCO2/boe and the French giant’s Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne says the firm is transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy and remains on course achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

World’s longest pipeline

Upon completion in 2025 Eacop will be the world’s longest heated pipeline transporting 216000 barrels of oil per day from Hoima in Uganda’s Lake Albert region to the Tanzania Indian ocean port of Tanga spanning a distance of 1443km.

The pipeline whose construction will start in the second half of 2022 will generate up to 34 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year but Mr Habumugisha says activists are failing to recognise measures the project promoters are deploying to mitigate environmental impact.

“We are introducing intrusion detection technologies we have added leak detection systems we have added general physical surveillance and in addition” he said adding that the activists’ campaigns will not stop the project.",,,,,,

The consumer watchdog alleges between November 2017 to at least November 2020 that Mastercard had a ""substantial degree of power"" in the market for the supply of credit card acceptance services under the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) least-cost routing initiative.

The least-cost routing initiative aimed to give merchants the ability to choose which debit card network processed their contactless dual-network debit card payments -- whether that was Mastercard Visa or Eftpos -- and was intended to increase competition in the supply of debit card acceptance services while reduce payments costs associated with processing debit card payments for businesses.

For dual-network debit card payments the fees paid by a merchant can vary depending on the debit card network used for processing the transaction.

The ACCC alleges that in response the least-cost routing initiative Mastercard entered into agreements with more than 20 major retailers including supermarkets fast food chains and clothing retailers to offer cheaper interchange rates for processing credit card payments if they agreed to process Mastercard-Eftpos debit card transactions through the Mastercard network rather than the Eftpos network even though Eftpos was often the lowest cost provider.

""We allege that Mastercard had substantial power in the market for the supply of credit card acceptance services and that a substantial purpose of Mastercard's conduct was to hinder the competitive process by deterring businesses from using Eftpos for processing debit transactions"" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said.

""We are concerned that Mastercard's alleged conduct meant that businesses did not receive the full benefit of the increased competition that was intended to flow from the least cost routing initiative.""

The ACCC is now seeking declarations penalties costs and other orders.

""Reducing costs for businesses enables them to offer their customers better prices. Making sure the major card schemes Mastercard Visa and Eftpos compete vigorously is important for both those businesses and their customers"" Cass-Gottlieb said.

In March 2021 the ACCC accepted a court-enforceable undertaking from Visa after the company was accused of taking similar actions and offering certain merchants cheaper interchange rates if they agreed to process Visa branded dual-network debit card payments through the Visa network rather than other ones like Eftpos.

Mastercard is not the only financial services business currently in hot water. On Monday the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said it has commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) for allegedly overstating how much available funds and balances customers had on their credit card accounts and charging fees and interest to customers who relied on this information when making withdrawals.

According to ASIC the alleged misconduct is the result of ""system errors"" that misled customers between May 2016 and September 2021 and from September 2021 to believe their credit card balance and available funds were in credit and that the balance would be available to withdraw from without incurring fees or interest.

His comment was part of a panel discussion held on Tuesday at the Global Blockchain Business Council’s (GBBC) Blockchain Central Davos Conference in Switzerland.To conclude the panel discussion the moderator asked each panellist whether SWIFT would still be around after five years. The panel included Jennifer Lassiter executive director of the Digital Dollar Project David Treat a director at Accenture and co-founder of the Digital Dollar Project Jon Frost senior economist at the Bank of International Settlements and Yuval Rooz the CEO of Digital Asset.Considering its stature and importance in the global payments network every other panel member responded positively barring Miebach who responded ‘no’. His answer astounded the group of executives attending the blockchain conference which is running parallel to the World Economic Forum.SWIFT stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is a financial payments protocol that facilitates cross-border payments. It is worth noting that SWIFT is not completely a payments facilitator but a messaging system which transfers payment instructions.It does not actually send money from one bank to another. It simply notifies one bank to credit/debit another bank account through encrypted messages.Let’s say you want to send money to a friend in the US. While filling out the money transfer request you would have to enter the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) of your friend’s bank his account number the amount you want to transfer etc. Once you hit send the money is debited from your account.Now what SWIFT does is it simply encrypts the details of your payment and sends it over to the recipient’s bank. Now your friend’s bank is notified of an incoming payment request so it credits your friend’s account. Of course this only happens after the funds bounce around from one bank to another until they reach your friend’s bank account. And then voila the money has been transferred.According to the official website SWIFT harnesses a network of 11000 financial institutions spread across two hundred countries to process over forty-six million transactions daily. It is widely used by central banks corporates financial institutions and custodians to make payments and settle trades. This is precisely why Miebach’s answer came as a surprise to those attending the panel discussion.However soon after the comment Mastercard released a statement via e-mail which read “Let us clarify the intent of the on-stage comment as it’s not as simple as a yes or no answer. Michael was simply reinforcing what SWIFT has previously said — their operations continue to evolve. Its current form will not be the same in the future. They are adding more functionality and moving past just being a messaging system.”SWIFT plans to leverage the capabilities of CBDC s to improve upon its offerings. CBDCs are gaining traction as cryptocurrencies have been at the receiving end of several central banks and governments. Many nations consider cryptocurrencies unfavourable due to their decentralised nature and the potential malfeasance that may follow. Hence countries and central banks view CBDCs as the next best alternative.One may argue that CBDCs shall be designed to simplify the role of a sovereign currency within a nation’s borders. It is also possible that all CBDCs may not be built upon the same technology. In such a case how will SWIFT unify multiple CBDCs? Several questions have been raised since the digital form of fiat currencies became the talk of the town.Well SWIFT has been tinkering with CBDCs since 2021. The messaging platform believes that linking various CBDCs is the key to unlocking their true potential and it could significantly simplify cross-border payments.In their experiments they were successfully able to execute a cross-border transaction between a CBDC network and the traditionally used RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement) system. On 19th May 2022 SWIFT announced on Twitter its collaboration with French IT firm Capgemini to build interlinking systems that would enable such payment combinations. According to its official blog post three use cases are being worked on - “CBDC to CBDC CBDC to fiat and fiat to CBDC. ““Navigating decentralisation is complex with many technology choices operating models and policy considerations. Our well-defined taxonomy has helped us accelerate our efforts to build CBDC interlinks with SWIFT” wrote Sudhir Pai Chief Technology & Innovation Officer Financial Services at Capgemini. “We look forward to continue to collaborate in building industry standards and frameworks with SWIFT” he added.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVhdGxhbnRhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RleGFzLWF1c3Rpbi1rYWl0bGluLWFybXN0cm9uZy1tb3JpYWgtd2lsc29uLW11cmRlci1jeWNsaXN0LWxhcmNlbnktYm90b3jSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g1YXRsYW50YS5jb20vbmV3cy90ZXhhcy1hdXN0aW4ta2FpdGxpbi1hcm1zdHJvbmctbW9yaWFoLXdpbHNvbi1tdXJkZXItY3ljbGlzdC1sYXJjZW55LWJvdG94LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fugitive Kaitlin Armstrong previously charged with larceny after not paying for $650 Botox procedure,"Texas fugitive Kaitlin Armstrong who is wanted by U.S. Marshals in connection with the May 11 shooting death of 25-year-old cyclist Moriah ‘Mo’ Wilson was charged with larceny in 2018 after she allegedly Botoxed-and-dashed according to court documents.

Larceny charge

A probable cause affidavit states that on March 6 2018 Armstrong received a $650 Botox procedure at a Travis County spa. After the procedure was completed she presented her MasterCard at the spa but said she had another card in her vehicle that she would rather use.

The now-34-year-old apparently left her MasterCard on the counter walked out of the spa and did not return to pay according to the affidavit.

Wilson's killing

Four years later the Austin Police Department (APD) issued a warrant on May 17 for Armstrong's arrest in connection with Wilson's killing.

Police responded to a 911 call from an East Austin residence on the 1700 block of Maple Avenue on May 11. Wilson was visiting Austin from San Francisco for a bike race.

The caller said her friend was ""bleeding and unconscious"" at the location. Police discovered Wilson suffering from ""multiple gunshot wounds"" upon arrival. Investigators determined that Wilson was shot inside the Maple Avenue residence. Authorities attempted CPR but ultimately pronounced Wilson dead at the scene.

The caller had also observed that Wilson's bike which she had told Wilson to move earlier in the day appeared to have been stolen according to an affidavit.

Officers later found Wilson's bike approximately 68 feet south of the Maple Avenue residence ""concealed in thick bamboo"" the affidavit states.

Love triangle

Austin professional cyclist Colin Strickland 35 who was in a long-term relationship with Armstrong at the time of Wilson's killing released a May 20 statement apologizing for his ""proximity to this horrible crime"" and explaining details that suggested the crime was related to domestic matters and a possible love triangle scenario according to KVUE reporter Tony Plohetski.

""I am so sorry and I simply can not make sense of this unfathomable tragedy"" Strickland said. ""Although it will be a matter of no small consolation to anyone else who cared for Mo I want you to know that I have fully cooperated with investigators ever since I learned the terrible news and I will continue to do so until some form of justice is served.""

He added that he ""had a brief romantic relationship"" with Wilson while she was visiting Austin in 2021 during a break in his relationship with Armstrong.

Strickland told police that he had picked up Wilson on his motorcycle to go swimming on the day of her death and lied to Armstrong about his whereabouts. He dropped her off later that night after they got food but he apparently did not see ""anyone nearby.""

Evidence

Security footage obtained by police apparently shows a black SUV with a large bike rack parking near the Maple Avenue residence a minute after Wilson returned home on the evening of May 11. The next day the U.S. Marshals Texas Lone Star Fugitive Task Force drove to Strickland's address where Armstrong was living and observed a 2012 black Jeep Cherokee with a large bike rack ""that appeared to be the same vehicle observed on surveillance footage."" Strickland told police that the Jeep belongs to Armstrong.

Officers discovered two 9 m.m. guns in Strickland's home one of which investigators determined to be ""significant to the investigation."" The professional cyclist told authorities he purchased two firearms between December 2021 and January 2022 including one for Strickland.

On May 14 an anonymous caller told police that when Armstrong found out about Wilson's relationship with Strickland in January she was ""shaking with anger"" and said she wanted to kill Wilson according to the affidavit.

On the run

On May 12 detectives apprehended Armstrong on an outstanding class B warrant for her arrest. Authorities interviewed the 34-year-old but mistakenly released her from custody on the misdemeanor warrant because her date of birth in the department’s report management system did not match the date of birth on the warrant APD Homicide Det. Richard Spitler said during a Wednesday press conference.

She had been on the run ever since.

Texas Deputy US Marshal Brandon Filla told The New York Post that Armstrong’s background in flipping houses may have provided her with ""the funds to continue to hide.""

""[Armstrong’s escape] wasn’t something that was abrupt this was something that was methodical that was timed. She had somewhat of a plan"" he told the outlet.

Now six months after it first arrived in stores it has launched one the best Sky deals we've ever seen on the custom-designed Glass 4K TV. Anyone who makes the jump to Sky Glass will be handed a £100 prepaid Mastercard to spend on anything they want.

This deal is available across all screen sizes (43-inch 55-inch and 66-inch) plus you can choose to have your new Sky Glass shipped in numerous fruity colours such as Dusky Pink Racing Green or Ocean Blue. Sky allows you to mix-and-match the colour of the telly and the protective fascia for the built-in soundbar – creating some unique colour-contrast looks that will look very striking in your living room. It's something we praised in our Sky Glass review when we took an in-depth look at the custom-designed QLED TV earlier this year.

Along with the £100 Mastercard debit card those ordering Sky Glass will also be offered a £50 Stream Puck without paying a penny for it. This mini streaming box can be plugged into any existing TV you have dotted around the home with it then bringing the full Sky experience to the screen.

If you weren't already Sky Glass and the Stream Puck both use your internet connection to beam content into your home. Everything you watch is streamed with both live TV and catch up services available as part of this platform.

Unlike older set-top boxes from Sky like Sky Q there's no hard disk tucked inside with users adding shows they like to a special Playlists section on the home screen. Anything that's been previously aired on channels such as BBC ITV Channel 4 and Sky Atlantic is then stored via cloud services with Sky promising that almost all content should be available to watch at any time without needing to fill up a hard disk."

The Ohio Tennis Coaches Association team tournament always takes place the following day.

Both teams boarded their buses for a friendly ride south as Sycamore swept Solon 3-0 for the Division I championship and Indian Hill took down Pepper Pike Orange for Division II bragging rights.

The Greater Miami Conference champion Sycamore Aves came in with an undefeated team record representing Division I in Southwest Ohio by defeating defending champion Mason. It was Sycamore's first appearance since 2016 when they were team champions. The Division I matches were played at New Albany.

Coach Mike Teets' players didn't lose a match Sunday sweeping New Albany in the semifinal on their home court before ending Solon's season in the final.

""We have been talking about this for a long time"" Teets said of the championship. ""This along with the GMC. We have been talking about it for 365 days. It's very rewarding to finally get here.""

Considering Mason had the state OHSAA singles and doubles champions Sycamore's triumph in the Greater Miami Conference and in the state team tournament is pretty impressive let alone running the table as a team.

""2015's team did it also"" Teets said. ""Two different groups of players. The similarity is there was a lot of talent and every single one of them was committed to the team goal.""

Their lineup was identical in both contests. In the final No. 1 singles went to Chad Miller with No. 3 Nicholas Choo also victorious. The clinching match was the No. 2 doubles team of Kevin Dong/Andrew Wittenbaum.

The victory made all forget about Saturday's OHSAA individual tournament which was still far from a disappointment. At the Lindner Family Tennis Center Nick Meyers/Mark Karev were Division I doubles runners-up and Southwest District champ Miller finished third in state singles with Choo fourth. Dong and Arjun Rajagopala were also state qualifiers.

The Aves roster included sophomore Choo senior Dong sophomore Kyle Friedrich senior Kareve sophomore Dhruv Kota sophomore Meyers senior Miller sophomore Arjun Rajagopala and sophomore Andrew Wittenbaum.

""We have a great returning group"" Teets said of what lies ahead. ""We certainly have six very strong sophomores returning so I'm pretty excited about that.""

In Division II Indian Hill returned to the OTCA tourney after finishing as state runner-up last year. The Braves last won the team tournament in 2007. The Division II matches were played at Upper Arlington.

Coach Wade Ward's Braves swept Bexley 3-0 then needed all of the matches to defeat Pepper Pike's Orange squad. In the semi the OHSAA Division II state doubles champion team of Tejas Pisati/R.J. Poffenberger returned to singles with Pisati winning second singles and Poffenberger third. A first doubles win by OHSAA state qualifiers Michael Ryu/Max Berghausen made it a semi sweep.

Ward flipped his lineup around for the championship match. This time Eshaan Gandhi delivered in second singles and OHSAA state qualifier Ethan Camp won third. His second doubles team was freshman Ryu/senior Pisati.

""Eshaan Gandhi really stepped up for us today"" Ward said. ""He hasn't really played a lot of singles this year but today was his time to shine. He played steady and won most of the pressure points. (Ethan) Camp has been undefeated at No. 3 singles so we put him out there to do his thing. Guess what? He's still undefeated!""

Ward then got the ""must-win"" at second doubles by pairing Ryu who was in first doubles in the semi with veteran Pisati who had himself quite a weekend to end his prep tennis career.

""Putting a state doubles champion with a solid freshman really made the difference in that match"" Ward said.

Indian Hill's only team losses came to Louisville St. Xavier and the Division I champs Sycamore in April. They were unbeaten in the Cincinnati Hills League and twice beat Division I St. Xavier.

Indian Hill's roster included sophomore Senuka A junior Berghausen sophomore Camp sophomore Gandhi senior Pisati sophomore Poffenberger sophomore Jack Pollack senior Sam Rhoad and freshman Ryu.

""I'm super excited for our players and parents"" Ward said. ""I know everyone works extremely hard in the off-season and we have the best parents in the state.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydGluZ25ld3MuY29tL3VzL3NvY2Nlci9uZXdzL2NoYW1waW9ucy1sZWFndWUtcHJpemUtbW9uZXktYnJlYWtkb3duLTIwMjItaG93LW11Y2gtd2lubmVycy9hbHlqenF2dGpqaHhrMzExb2l2aWVyem7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Champions League prize money breakdown 2022: How much do the winners get?,"The UEFA Champions League is the pinnacle of cup football altering the financial stratosphere of the clubs who are able to qualify for the competition through their domestic leagues.

The 2022 Champions League final will herald an enormous package for the winners though slightly reduced compared with the last campaign's prize money because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Further doubts were cast over the fitness of England white-ball captain Eoin Morgan who left the field of play during Middlesex's four-wicket win over Glamorgan with a ""twinge in his groin"" and did not bat.

At 35 Morgan's career is in its twilight period. A reputation built on the basis of being a world-class batter as well as a ruthless and inspirational leader has given him the power to write his own script as to how he wishes his career to end. The problem however has been whether he still has the ability to do so as he wishes.

Morgan is without a T20 half-century since November 2020 which even by his own feast-or-famine standards of form is a particularly lean run and Sunday's game was just his second in four months after tweaking his quad in Barbados in January and going unselected in the IPL auction.

For years Morgan was a banker for England on the pitch and an ever-present in the world's premier T20 tournament. Now he is neither with the added salt in the wound being that as Morgan walked off the field at Radlett CC in front of not many more than a thousand people his likely successor as white-ball captain Jos Buttler was walking out in front of a 100 times that figure in the IPL final in Ahmedabad. Radlett may be the hometown of Hollywood staple Simon Cowell but the glitz and glamour of this English village does ultimately end there.

Earlier this week in an interview with the Evening Standard  Morgan said that he would not be playing in back-to-back matches in this Blast campaign in the hope of avoiding injury. With England's ODI series against the Netherlands likely to see him miss a handful of games in mid-June he has also handed over the Middlesex T20 captaincy to Stephen Eskinazi.

But even after missing Middlesex's match against Hampshire two days ago he was unable to complete 20 overs in the field with the time he spent off then preventing him from being able to bat any higher than No. 7 during the home side's successful chase of 168. With the side then almost home when the fifth wicket was lost Middlesex decided against taking any undue risk though confirmed he would have batted if needed.

Morgan also explained in the interview how ""there's nothing specific [injury wise]"" that is troubling him adding: ""I'm just old I think."" While honest that further highlights the concern for England that their captain might not be fit enough to lead them through the summer and to the T20 World Cup in Australia this winter. Not being able to play back-to-back games is all well and good if the second of the two games is in the group stage of the Blast; less so if it's the World Cup final.

This was a comfortable victory for Middlesex after restricting Glamorgan to a total of 168 that never looked enough. Against Gloucestershire at this ground on Thursday Middlesex scored 229 and even then there was some feeling that they were a dozen or so short after they had been 122 for 2 after 8.5 overs.

To one side this is a very small ground where boundaries fly; to the other it is a vast expanse where threes are available regularly if the ball hasn't already crashed into the advertising hoardings. The result is runs aplenty a fact exemplified by the first ball of both innings being dispatched for six.

Labuschagne top scored for Glamorgan with 38 off 24 an innings of two halves where only nine runs came from his first 12 deliveries while 29 came from the second. The problem for Glamorgan was that the moments where their innings was showing the potential of what could be was in actual fact what had to be.

Much of the credit for Glamorgan's restriction to 168 was thanks to a fine bowling performance from slow left-armer Thilan Walallawita who recorded career best figures of 3 for 18 off his four overs. Walallawita spoke after the game of playing with a sense of freedom and how he knew the ground where Middlesex often play second XI fixtures like the back of his hand.

Comfortable in his surroundings the young spinner shone. From his fledgling T20 career he has a career economy rate of 6.33 and has taken six wickets at an average of 12.67. Meanwhile Toby Roland-Jones ' fine start to the season continued as he picked up 4 for 22 three of which arrived in the final over.

In reply Middlesex flew out of the blocks the powerplay coming to an end with the side on 62 for no loss - Eskinazi on 25 off 16 and Max Holden racing to 37 off 20.

Continuing the recent tradition of English cricket the opening stand broke the back of the chase and despite a middle-over wobble arriving thanks to the spin of Prem Sisodiya - who bowled with control to return figures of 2 for 26 - Middlesex eased their way home with an over to spare thanks to a Joe Cracknell flourish the 22-year-old finishing with 47 off 28 balls.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydGluZ25ld3MuY29tL3VzL3NvY2Nlci9uZXdzL3VlZmEtY2hhbXBpb25zLWxlYWd1ZS1maXh0dXJlcy0yMDIyLTIwMjMtdWNsLWdhbWVzLXNjaGVkdWxlL3ByM29ibXY4Y3FoZHJjdHR0czBqY3R4bNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UEFA Champions League fixtures 2022-2023: When are UCL matches on next season's schedule?,"As one UEFA Champions League campaign comes to a close attention quickly turns to the next.

After that three further rounds of two-leg aggregate-goal qualifiers will be held in July and August before the group stage proper kicks off in early September.

Due to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar being held at the end of the year the Champions League group stage will be accelerated and last less than two months concluding on Nov. 2.

There will then be a three-month break in Champions League action before the competition's knockout stages begin in mid-February.

The 2022-23 Champions League final will then be held a bit later than usual on June 10 in Istanbul.

Changes in Champions League format coming

UEFA confirmed in May 2022 that the UEFA Champions League group stage will grow from 32 to 36 teams from the 2024-25 season onwards.

Along with an increase in clubs the format of the competition is also set to change considerably.

Rather than the current group stage which consists of six matches the competition will soon adopt a system where teams must play eight games prior to the knockout stage with all sides placed in a single league table.

The top eight teams in the standings after eight matches will progress directly to the next round while sides sitting ninth to 24th will compete in two-legged playoffs.

Those format changes will alter the competition's overall schedule with more group stage games needing to be played.

UEFA are yet to release any possible dates for the Champions League from 2024 onwards but expect some scheduling alterations."

(NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP via Getty Images)

Dave McCormick forged a relationship with Ray Dalio the founder of Bridgewater Associates in early 2008 and was rewarded with a job at Bridgewater after Dalio made $780 million on the financial collapse.

Much like his upbringing Dave McCormick the Republican challenger for US Senate in Pennsylvania can attribute his wealth and his career as the president and CEO of the world’s largest hedge fund to being in the right place at the right time.

McCormick served as the president of Bridgewater Associates the world’s largest hedge fund from 2009 when working Pennsylvanians were reeling from the financial collapse to 2020 and served as its CEO from 2020 to 2022.

A recent book titled “The Fund” by Rob Copeland is a biography that focuses on Ray Dalio’s rise as the founder of Bridgewater Associates.

It also shines a spotlight on how McCormick got rich thanks to the proverbial revolving door and his friendship with Dalio while he was serving as the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs in 2008.

“When you look at something like the recession where millions and millions of people lost their pensions or were severely hurt millions lost their jobs and to hear that someone benefited during that time it’s heartbreaking” Darrin Kelly President of the Allegheny/Fayette County Labor Council said in in an interview.

McCormick began working under former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2007 and went to Bridgewater Associates in 2009.

During this time Copeland explained in his book that McCormick met with Dalio multiple times in early 2008 when Dalio predicted an impending financial crisis and at these meetings Dalio was encouraging McCormick and other officials from former President George W. Bush’s administration and the Treasury to print money in order to stave off a financial crisis.

Once the great recession started the federal government would heed Dalio’s advice and print trillions of dollars throughout the end of 2008.

According to Copeland Dalio was betting against the dollar by investing in gold treasury bonds and commodities as the government was pumping trillions of dollars into the struggling economy in the fall of 2008.

“While Bridgewater’s automated trading systems were positioned relatively conservatively in 2007 and 2008 Dalio himself ordered a number of manual adjustments so the fund would profit more heavily from an overall decline investment staffers there then recall. Throughout this period he had placed a series of bets that would pay off if central bankers printed money to revive the economy—the exact move he had predicted” Copeland wrote in the book.

Dalio made $780 million dollars in 2008 as Bridgewater Associates’ Alpha fund saw a 9% increase. Other hedge funds were witnessing 20% losses during that time.

Dalio then rewarded McCormick by hiring him as Bridgewater Associates’ president in 2009. McCormick would then go on to earn $21 million in 2021 as the hedge fund’s CEO.

To put things into perspective over 191000 Pennsylvanians lost their jobs in 2008 and 2009 and the state’s unemployment rate peaked at 9.3% in October 2010. Home foreclosures in the state skyrocketed by 173% during that time and over 44000 properties were foreclosed on in 2009.

All of this happened while McCormick began working at Bridgewater Associates.

“You look at it right now there are still pension funds that have not gotten fully back. There are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of union members whose pensions were literally wiped out or were taken to the point where they’re still not back. People are still struggling from that day” Kelly said.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 2022 that McCormick and his wife Dina Powell a Goldman Sachs executive are worth between $116 million to $290 million and possibly more.

McCormick lived in Connecticut while working for Bridgewater and the Associated Press reported that he rents a $16 million mansion on Connecticut’s “Gold Coast” one of the densest concentrations of wealth in the country. The mansion includes a 1500-bottle wine cellar an elevator and a private beachfront resort overlooking the Long Island Sound.

McCormick’s wealth and lavish lifestyle are already focal points in his upcoming campaign against US Sen. Bob Casey.

Casey is campaigning on a progressive economic platform that includes supporting unions going after junk fees and going after corporations for price gouging during and after the pandemic.

Casey is also using his opponents out of state residence and wealth whenever he gets a chance to on the campaign trail.

“He doesn’t live in Pennsylvania. He lied about living in Pennsylvania. We know that and he continues to try to make that case that he’s living here” Casey said to supporters in Lancaster last month.

“So here’s a candidate who’s an out-of-state candidate being supported by out of state billionaires. We don’t want a senator like that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9jaGFkLXJldXRlci1iZWxpZXZlcy1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stY2FuLWNvbXBldGUtZm9yLXN0YXJ0ZXItc25hcHMtYXMtcm9va2llL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chad Reuter Believes Mason McCormick Can Compete For Starter Snaps As Rookie,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9jaGFkLXJldXRlci1iZWxpZXZlcy1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stY2FuLWNvbXBldGUtZm9yLXN0YXJ0ZXItc25hcHMtYXMtcm9va2llL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533D39CB80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9jaGFkLXJldXRlci1iZWxpZXZlcy1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stY2FuLWNvbXBldGUtZm9yLXN0YXJ0ZXItc25hcHMtYXMtcm9va2llL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhZ2xlY291bnRyeW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2JyYXVuLXdpbnMtZ29wLXByaW1hcnktam9pbnMtbWNjb3JtaWNrLWluLXJhY2UtZm9yLWdvdmVybm9yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Braun Wins GOP Primary Joins McCormick in Race for Governor,"Jennifer McCormick was unopposed in the Democratic primary.

Hong Kong's versions of popular American fast-food chains are sometimes better than the original ones in the US.

For example the city is famously home to the McDonald's Next concept a version of the fast-food franchise that strives to be ""modern and progressive.""

I visited the location in Admiralty which has been called the ""fanciest McDonald's in the world."" Here are seven things that surprised me when I visited.

The build-your-own-salad bar was one of the first things I noticed

Customers could make their own salad while they waited for their burgers. Kaitlyn Cheung

Modeled after Chipotle's fast-casual concept the build-your-own-salad bar has 19 ingredients including different types of greens quinoa and sauces.

Customers can take a few minutes to build their own salads while waiting for their made-to-order burgers to be served from the kitchen to the table.

Each meal was customizable and there were a variety of options

I could customize the meat and toppings on my burger. Kaitlyn Cheung

I excitedly ordered my own burger at one of the many ""Create Your Taste"" kiosks. I could choose my preferences for bread meat and vegetables for my burger as I sifted through the screen's many options.

The burger selection offered choices of bun or bun-less and meat or Portobello mushroom and the addition of top-notch ingredients such as Parmesan cheese guacamole caramelized onions and even truffle sauce.

Some of the menu items were themed. Kaitlyn Cheung

Even more surprising to me was that my custom burger cost less than $10.

The advertising and menu were sleek and elegant

The menus and posters of food looked elegant. Kaitlyn Cheung

The cold-brew coffee looked like something straight out of a TV ad and pictures of special menu items like pizza and tiramisu were plastered on posters and looked delectably delicious.

Even the different coffee beans were nicely advertised as if they were a choice between sauvignon blanc or chardonnay.

The service reminded me of a restaurant-quality experience

I placed the number on my table after I made my order. Kaitlyn Cheung

Once I placed my order at the kiosk I was dispensed a number to place on my table. A staff member brought my order so I never even had to get up.

Getting to dine in added a touch of the slow-food movement to the Happy-Meal experience. The different seating arrangements catered to a variety of diners and groups reminiscent of a restaurant-quality experience.

There were some themed food items on the menu

I ordered a My Melody-themed meal with a drink a burger and fries. Kaitlyn Cheung

For roughly $1 I ordered Sanrio My Melody-themed curly fries and a peach soda. The soda was fizzy with bits of peach jelly at the bottom of the drink and the fries were Cajun-style and slightly soggy from being cooked in oil.

Neither of these food items has remotely anything to do with My Melody but the packaging was endearing and aesthetically pleasing.

The burger had lettuce tomato and a brioche bun. Kaitlyn Cheung

One can't order curly fries or a brioche bun at the franchise in the US so this was another perk of dining at McDonald's Next.

The restaurant was equipped with wireless charging stations

This McDonald's seemed to be designed to make patrons want to stay for the whole day.

Equipped with wireless charging technology the comfort and convenience of the restaurant's amenities gave a nod to Hong Kong's fast-paced urban culture.

I was impressed with the chic interior design

Even the exterior of McDonald's Next looked chic. Kaitlyn Cheung

The space was decorated with untreated oak polished concrete flooring and understated line drawings of McDonald's classic menu items.

The interior of McDonald's Next had an industrial design and a warehouse feel. Kaitlyn Cheung

Open ceilings with visible ductwork and walls with exposed studs and joint work created a warehouse-style aesthetic that took the emphasis away from the setting and shifted my focus to the food.

This McDonald's Next concept stole the show with a minimalist metallic design.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3JlZy5jb20vbmV3cy8xLWtpbGxlZC0xLWluanVyZWQtaW4td2hpdGVoYXZlbi1tY2RvbmFsZHMtc2hvb3Rpbmcv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93cmVnLmNvbS9uZXdzLzEta2lsbGVkLTEtaW5qdXJlZC1pbi13aGl0ZWhhdmVuLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1zaG9vdGluZy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 killed 1 injured in Whitehaven McDonald’s shooting,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3JlZy5jb20vbmV3cy8xLWtpbGxlZC0xLWluanVyZWQtaW4td2hpdGVoYXZlbi1tY2RvbmFsZHMtc2hvb3Rpbmcv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93cmVnLmNvbS9uZXdzLzEta2lsbGVkLTEtaW5qdXJlZC1pbi13aGl0ZWhhdmVuLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1zaG9vdGluZy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533D130700>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3JlZy5jb20vbmV3cy8xLWtpbGxlZC0xLWluanVyZWQtaW4td2hpdGVoYXZlbi1tY2RvbmFsZHMtc2hvb3Rpbmcv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93cmVnLmNvbS9uZXdzLzEta2lsbGVkLTEtaW5qdXJlZC1pbi13aGl0ZWhhdmVuLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1zaG9vdGluZy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2t0bGEuY29tL25ld3MvbmV4c3Rhci1tZWRpYS13aXJlL2xhd3llci1mb3Itd29tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtYXQtbWNkb25hbGRzLWFjY3VzZXMtc2hlcmlmZi1vZi1yaWRpY3VsaW5nLWhlci13aXRoLWhhcHB5LW1lYWwtY29tbWVudC_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9rdGxhLmNvbS9uZXdzL25leHN0YXItbWVkaWEtd2lyZS9sYXd5ZXItZm9yLXdvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWF0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1hY2N1c2VzLXNoZXJpZmYtb2YtcmlkaWN1bGluZy1oZXItd2l0aC1oYXBweS1tZWFsLWNvbW1lbnQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lawyer for woman arrested at McDonald’s accuses sheriff of ridiculing her with ‘Happy Meal’ comment,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://ktla.com/news/nexstar-media-wire/lawyer-for-woman-arrested-at-mcdonalds-accuses-sheriff-of-ridiculing-her-with-happy-meal-comment/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2t0bGEuY29tL25ld3MvbmV4c3Rhci1tZWRpYS13aXJlL2xhd3llci1mb3Itd29tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtYXQtbWNkb25hbGRzLWFjY3VzZXMtc2hlcmlmZi1vZi1yaWRpY3VsaW5nLWhlci13aXRoLWhhcHB5LW1lYWwtY29tbWVudC_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9rdGxhLmNvbS9uZXdzL25leHN0YXItbWVkaWEtd2lyZS9sYXd5ZXItZm9yLXdvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWF0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1hY2N1c2VzLXNoZXJpZmYtb2YtcmlkaWN1bGluZy1oZXItd2l0aC1oYXBweS1tZWFsLWNvbW1lbnQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvbWNkb25hbGRzLW5ldy1saWQtbWFjaGluZS_SATtodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWRvdC5jb20vaXJsL21jZG9uYWxkcy1uZXctbGlkLW1hY2hpbmUvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘No more spilt delivery drinks’: McDonald’s employee reveals new lid machine sparking debate,"The Fast Food Industry as a whole generated a whopping $278.6 billion in revenue in 2021 and a lot of that can be contributed to companies following the basic principles of great food service: maintaining ingredient quality getting orders right and preparing meals that are tasty and distinct to a company’s branding. Sure there’s a lot of clever marketing that reels customers in but if your fare isn’t tasty and patrons can’t expect more or less the same experience every time they visit one of your franchises then you’re probably not going to establish a devoted group of folks willing to throw money your way.

But all of these factors are also enhanced by technological advancements that help businesses stay ahead of the curve. A slew of innovations are constantly being devised/tested in order to keep folks coming back for more while increasing profits. Sometimes these advancements don’t even necessarily pertain to enhancing a food’s flavor.

One example is the new take-out drink lid system McDonald’s is apparently trying out at some of its franchises as evidenced by a now viral TikTok video. Take a gander for yourself.

In the clip uploaded by a creator who goes by Ollie (@oll3_02) we see someone take an uncovered drink placed in a machine designed to hold a single cup. Once the cup is inserted the machine retrieves it whirs a little bit and then ejects the beverage—it’s now covered by a single film of plastic on top sealing the carbonated goodness inside.

This kind of “drink enclosure” system is typically seen in many bubble tea shops. Judging from Ollie’s caption which reads “No more spilt delivery drinks” it appears that the traditional lids aren’t going anywhere. He further explained the machine’s function in the comments section of the post.

“Just to clear up a few things the machine has been put in our store as a trial and is for delivery only” he says. “It looks slow but we have an automatic drinks machine so don’t spend time anymore making the fizzy drinks as a machine makes them for us.”

The “automatic drinks machine” that Ollie is referring to is an impressive piece of tech if you haven’t seen it before. That in combination with the special lid contraption makes for a pretty much hands-free beverage consumption experience which after the COVID-19 pandemic is probably a relief for many customers.

There were some commenters who expressed their excitement at the plastic film applying machine.

“As a delivery rider this is HUGE no other drinks spill apart from mcdonalds” one viewer wrote.

“Wait that’s actually huge drinks was always what slowed down orders when I worked there” a former employee said.

Others however thought that the lid machine would ultimately slow down orders and eventually run into a litany of issues sort of like how Mickey D’s ice cream machines are almost always out of order.

“‘Can I have a coke please’ ‘can’t love the lid machine ain’t working’” one user joked.

“Bro I know how slow that automatic drinks machine is don’t lie” another said.

And then there were some who were concerned about the ecological impact of the plastic film.

“Ah yes replacing recyclable lids with unrecyclable plastic film” one commenter argued.

According to Earth 911 “Plastic wrap and film packaging are generally #2 and #4 plastic both of which are recyclable. It is often recycled into composite lumber but it can become a wide variety of products. Unless your local recycling service tells you otherwise plastic wrap and film must be taken to a drop-off location for recycling.”

McDonald’s lids are also not considered recyclable according to QuerySprout.

However the plastic film along with all recyclable items needs to be clean and free of any residue—a requirement that may be difficult to meet if the film is attached to the cup.

There’s no word yet as to whether or not lid closing machines will become a staple of McDonald’s but with the rise in popularity of food delivery apps more and more take-out orders are coming from the franchise’s locations every day.

The Daily Dot has reached out to Ollie on TikTok for further comment on the machine.

Many appear excited and happy to start the day one is upset and teary and the rest are somewhere in between. Standing ready to greet the children are Alison Dula data manager and receptionist and Penny Smith bookkeeper and administrative assistant to the principal.

Stationed at the front office they call out to students. “Good morning girls. Buenos dias.” “Good morning boys stop running!” “How’s my baby?” “Good morning Elena how are you?” “Good morning Josh! You need a note.”

Some children wave and walk on to the cafeteria but a regular group of youngsters stops by the reception area and lines up to receive morning hugs smiles and words of affirmation. Skylyn my granddaughter gets a daily hug from Alison and Pedro makes a bee-line to Penny.

“Y’all have a good day. I love you.” “I missed you yesterday Angel” the cheerful chatter continues.

The positive vibes spread as many of the youngsters affirm their greeters in return. “I like your necklace Ms. Penny.” A few even spread the sunshine to other students as they walk down the hall.

A second grader is having a difficult morning and needs some one-on-one attention. Mrs. Penny hugs her and brushes back her hair then takes her hand and walks her to the cafeteria to pick up a bagged breakfast of orange juice a chicken biscuit a cheese stick and a banana. She walks her back to the office a little more composed and ready to start the day.

Meanwhile Ms. Alison is having her daily check-in with Luis also a second grader. “Did you read last night Luis?” she asks to which he responds “I read Wednesday night.” The adults nearby break into laughter because Wednesday was six days ago. Luis shrugs in mild irritation and walks away.

Breakfast in hand hugs and greetings completed a group of youngsters moves toward the media center several forming the sign-language symbol for “I love you” as they file past the large office window.

Ms. Alison and Mrs. Penny give out another dose of positivity. “Have fun.” “I like your shirt!” “Be good to your sub today!” “You can do it!”

By all appearances this is the favorite part of the day for both women but they say the children bring the same enthusiasm all through the day as they parade past the office window. Both ladies appreciate how sincerely the children respond to them and Penny laughingly calls some of their comments a “Hot Mess Express.”

Many of the students are from low-income families. Alison tells how the school held a Facebook fundraiser to help the Kindergarten first and second graders go to Tweetsie Railroad this year. The fundraiser brought in enough money to pay for the trip and will allow the school to purchase some outdoor furniture for teachers and students.

As mothers themselves Alison and Penny consider it their jobs to establish relationships with the parents and assure them that their children are looked after. Many of the parents work very hard and must entrust their children’s transportation and daily care to designated adults. They want the parents to know their children are safe and loved.

I ask the ladies what makes them so passionate about their work at Hillcrest. They tell me they were able to follow their hearts back to the school they both attended as children and now they can give back.

Penny says “I think what connects me is I grew up across the street. I know what it’s like to be in this neighborhood. I know what it’s like to go to bed hungry. I know what it’s like to go to this school. I can relate to them.”

Alison attended Hillcrest during fifth and sixth grades because her grandmother lived in the district and could make sure she did her homework after school while her mother worked. Having been a latchkey kid for a while Alison now has a special affection for the kids who need a little extra support.

With school ending for the summer next week the daily routines will change. Lots of students look forward to summer vacation but Alison says “Some of our kids ask to go to summer school even though they don’t need to.” Both women speak of how much they will miss the children during the break.

Ultimately Alison and Penny both feel a Christian calling to their work with the children and to their work with each other.

“We’re a pair. We come in with the intent to be a blessing to the children” says Penny “but they are a blessing to us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy8zLXN0b2Nrcy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1qdXN0LWJvdWdodC10aGF0LWRlc2VydmUtYS1wbGFjZS1pbi80Mjg0NzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks Warren Buffett Just Bought That Deserve a Place in Your Portfolio,"The stock market has been under immense pressure since the beginning of the year due to several macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.

In Minnesota's strong economy choice becomes harder,"Kai Westby always assumed he would need a four-year degree to work in corporate business.

Higher Ed Fewer Learners An occasional series about how declining enrollment is reshaping higher education.

He started at Minnesota State University Mankato in fall 2020 but realized after just one semester that the traditional college path was not for him. Westby 20 left the university and soon discovered a new apprenticeship program with Aon insurance company that could also lead to his dream corporate career.

Now a year into the program Westby works for Aon while pursuing an associate degree in marketing and management at Normandale Community College. The company pays him a salary covers his tuition and is offering him a chance to move into a higher position — such as insurance specialist human resource specialist or IT analyst — once he completes his two-year apprenticeship.

""I thought about leaving four years of college and I'm like 'That's just four years with a piece of paper and a lot of debt'"" Westby said. ""But this is a great experience with absolutely no debt left behind.""

In a historically tight labor market a growing number of employers are wooing Minnesotans like Westby by eliminating four-year degree requirements for jobs and offering to train new hires themselves. Those companies in Minnesota and the U.S. are prioritizing specific skills and experience over educational background opening more careers to people without degrees and raising questions about whether a college education is as necessary as it used to be.

Kai Westby an Aon apprentice worked in a conference room at Aon's office in Bloomington. Westby prefers this to his desk due to the extra space privacy and white board access.

Minnesota colleges many of which lost 25% of their enrollment over the past decade are responding by partnering with employers and launching accelerated programs to get students into the workforce more quickly. To remain relevant they will have to convince employers and increasingly skeptical families that costly degrees are still valuable.

""Our colleges and universities should be ready to meet the workforce demand not only of today but also of the work of the future"" said Devinder Malhotra chancellor of the Minnesota State colleges and universities system.

Workers without degrees are in high demand in Minnesota. Eight of the state's top 10 in-demand occupations require only a high school diploma. And more than 40% of the roughly 206000 job vacancies in the second quarter of 2021 had no educational requirements according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development's most recent data.

Registered trade apprenticeships — only some of which require education at a technical college — have also been on the rise in Minnesota more than doubling since the late 1990s according to the state Department of Labor and Industry.

Degrees not required

In recent years some major companies have begun considering workers without college degrees for white-collar jobs if they have relevant skills and experience. Those removing four-year degree requirements say it is helping diversify their workforce and expand applicant pools.

""We're trying to bring a new group of people into the professional workforce and while we're doing it we're helping solve a talent shortage"" said Ray Longo Aon's Upper Midwest market leader who manages the company's corporate apprentice program in Minnesota.

Aon is working with Accenture and other partner companies to establish corporate apprenticeship networks in several U.S. cities including Minneapolis.

The Minnesota apprenticeship network is off to a strong start with participation from Aon Accenture economic development partnership Greater MSP and locally headquartered companies such as Best Buy and Cargill. The companies hope to collectively hire at least 1000 apprentices in the Twin Cities by 2025.

""This isn't a debate about whether a bachelor's degree is a valuable qualification in today's economy. It's a recognition that a four-year degree isn't necessary for success in many entry-level roles"" said Peter Frosch president and CEO of Greater MSP. ""Minnesota employers would be smart to be on the forefront of that change because opening hiring to more potential employees is a competitive advantage.""

Between 2017 and 2019 U.S. employers loosened college degree requirements for 46% of middle-skill jobs and 31% of high-skill occupations according to a report released this year by the Burning Glass Institute a nonprofit research center that analyzed millions of online job postings. The trend accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic researchers found and they projected a million more jobs could open to people without degrees in the next five years if employers keep lowering requirements.

Apprentices from Aon and Accenture mingled with company leaders and other invitees during a Minnesota Apprentice Network professional mixer at Aon's office in Bloomington.

More than 80 of America's largest employers — including Minnesota-based companies Best Buy Target and Medtronic — recently pledged to change their hiring and promotion practices to emphasize skills over college degrees.

Medtronic has removed college degree requirements for about 25% of its information technology jobs replacing them with skills-based criteria such as competence in certain software and technology.

Since doing so about a third of Medtronic's new hires have been people without four-year degrees and a quarter of the medical device company's promotions have gone to employees without a bachelor's degree said Amy Wilson human resources director on Medtronic's global talent acquisition team.

""It's highlighting for us that we are having the impact that we are considering and hiring talent that wouldn't have otherwise been considered"" Wilson said. ""External candidates who would have never been able to join the company now have a pathway in.""

Colleges set new course

The shift in workforce needs and hiring practices presents a new problem for colleges and universities: People who had questioned the affordability of college now may also question the necessity.

That could bode ill for colleges here and nationwide. In Minnesota total undergraduate enrollment has plummeted by almost a third since 2010 to levels last seen in the late 1990s.

Between 2010 and 2020 the share of Minnesota high school students who enter the workforce after graduation increased from 19% to 24% while the share who enroll in college decreased from 70% to 62% according to state data.

A bachelor's degree remains a time-tested path to success however. Research shows college graduates earn significantly more money over their lifetime than high school graduates and are less likely to be unemployed or live in poverty. Degree holders also vote and volunteer more often divorce less frequently and even have longer life expectancy.

""There's nothing like a college education for economic mobility. That is still true"" said Lori Carrell chancellor of the University of Minnesota's Rochester campus.

St. Cloud State University President Robbyn Wacker said she believes employers may lose out on well-rounded workers by hiring for specific skills. In college people learn secondary skills such as professional communication conflict management and leadership which help them be more effective in the workplace she said.

""Don't you want an employee that can do all of these things?"" Wacker said.

But Wacker and other college leaders acknowledge that higher education institutions must adapt to meet the needs of people who want to quickly enter the workforce.

St. Cloud State is considering upending the traditional college model by letting new students begin their studies at several points throughout the year instead of just the start of the fall or spring semesters. The university also may offer degree programs with accelerated graduation timelines.

Students are increasingly showing interest in faster programs. Nearly half of the more than 5000 U.S. high school students surveyed by the Minneapolis-based ECMC Group between February 2020 and January 2022 said they want their post-high school education to last less than four years. Those students also said they would prefer to learn on the job or in hands-on classroom settings.

The University of Minnesota Rochester is among the first colleges to pilot an accelerated bachelor's degree program. It's launching a health sciences degree program this year called ""Nxt Gen Med"" in which students will take a mix of online and in-person classes year-round allowing them to graduate in 2½ years instead of four. Students participating in the program will be guaranteed paid internships at the Mayo Clinic.

Carrell said she thinks accelerated bachelor's degree programs can lower college costs and reduce the likelihood of students dropping out. She's leading a national ""College in 3"" project that has tapped 13 colleges to explore and possibly create three-year degree programs.

""Dropping out with debt is bad for the individual"" Carrell said. ""It's also bad for society broadly when we talk about economics and we look at the incredible workforce demands right now.""

The Minnesota State colleges and universities system is focused on increasing its partnerships with employers.

Many of the system's community colleges have received grants of up to $400000 from the state Department of Employment and Economic Development in recent years to develop and deliver custom training for local businesses. Anoka-Ramsey Community College for example just received funding to provide medical device production training to employees of a manufacturer in Ramsey.

Larry Lundblad Minnesota State's executive director for workforce and economic development said these partnerships will be important as the college system seeks to educate more working adults amid an impending decline in the U.S. high school student population.

Colleges and universities will need to offer more specific career pathways Lundblad said.

""I know a lot of people that got a degree in something because they were in college and they needed to declare a major and they got out and they did something totally different"" Lundblad said. ""I think long term once we've changed systems and ways of doing business we'll see ... people being more focused in what they're doing and what they need.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHA6Ly93d3cucHRjYS5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA1MjlfTUVEVFJPTklDX1NQWVJBTC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Renal Denervation for Controlling Hypertension Featured at EuroPCR,"Renal Denervation for Controlling Hypertension Featured at EuroPCR

Panel discusses renal denervation

at EuroPCR 2022 May 29 2022 -- At this year's EuroPCR meeting in Paris the largest European conference in the field of interventional cardiology the topic of renal denervation (RDN) resurfaced with significant positive results from several trials across devices. One panel titled "" Hypertension management in 2022: control it live longer "" discussed both the six-month outcomes from the RADIANCE-HTN trial and the three-year data from SPYRAL HTN-ON MED and GSR-DEFINE trials part of the SPYRAL HTN Global Clinical Program. (Note: to view the panel discussion above you must have registered with EuroPCR for this year's meeting.)

Dr. Ajay Kirtane The bottom line was that in these sham-controlled trials renal denervation provided an additional therapeutic avenue for those patients who are unable to control their hypertension with lifestyle changes and medications. In all the studies presented RDN lowered blood pressures whether the patient was on or off medications. Dr. Ajay Kirtane Director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center presented the data from the RADIANCE_HTN study. You can see a video recap of his presentation on YouTube . The press release regarding the SPYRAL studies from Medtronic follows: EuroPCR: Medtronic Renal Denervation System Shows Better Blood Pressure Control with Significantly More Time in Target Range

Medtronic Adds to SPYRAL HTN Global Clinical Program with Late Breaking Clinical Data for SPYRAL HTN-ON MED and GSR-DEFINE May 17 2022 -- Dublin and Paris -- Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) a global leader in healthcare technology today announced data showing the benefits of the Symplicity Blood Pressure Procedure with the Symplicity Spyral Renal Denervation (RDN) system on achieving target blood pressure level ranges. As part of the SPYRAL HTN Global Clinical Program three-year data from SPYRAL HTN-ON MED and GSR-DEFINE were presented at EuroPCR 2022 as late-breaking clinical trials on May 17 2022. Time in target range (TTR) plays an important role in the management of many chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension measuring how well a parameter (e.g. blood pressure) is controlled in patients. Specifically for hypertension increasing TTR has been shown to be an independent predictor of reductions in cardiovascular risks including stroke heart attack and death.[1] In a recent consensus statement(opens new window) by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions and the National Kidney Foundation TTR is recognized as an effective measure of blood pressure control. As part of the statement TTR is also noted as an important consideration to include as an endpoint in clinical trials and registries. ""The data presented today at EuroPCR provide meaningful insights into the benefits of RDN through a patient lens looking at how much time they spend within a target BP range"" said Jason Weidman senior vice president and president of the Coronary & Renal Denervation business which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""This new data reinforces RDN's effectiveness as a complementary solution for achieving better blood pressure control and reducing cardiovascular risk."" SPYRAL HTN-ON MED 3-Year Data

Results from the first 80 patients in the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED trial demonstrate improved BP control with significantly higher TTR after radiofrequency RDN when compared to sham through three years regardless of anti-hypertensive medications. TTR for patients treated with RDN (33.7% TTR) was nearly double of sham patients (18.8% TTR) through three years (p=0.023). SPYRAL HTN-ON MED is a global randomized sham-controlled trial investigating the blood pressure lowering effect and safety of RDN with the radiofrequency-based Medtronic Symplicity Spyral system in hypertensive patients prescribed one to three anti-hypertensive medications. The trial enrolled 80 typical uncontrolled hypertensive patients randomized to RDN (n=38) or sham control (n=42). The findings build upon the recent three-year safety and efficiency data presented at ACC.22(opens new window) which demonstrated safe and sustained blood pressure reductions through three years.

Dr. David Kandzari ""By focusing on TTR in patients with uncontrolled hypertension we can better understand how RDN can help control blood pressure and sustain a healthy level"" said Dr. David Kandzari chief Piedmont Heart Institute and Cardiovascular Services and SPYRAL HTN-ON MED lead principal investigator. ""These three-year data showed us that RDN nearly doubles the time patients spend in their target blood pressure range regardless of anti-hypertensive medications reinforcing the long-term benefit of the procedure.""

GSR-DEFINE 3-Year Data

In the GSR-DEFINE study improved blood pressure control after radiofrequency RDN is associated with lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) through three years in real-world patients. RDN patients spent 34.9% time in TTR through three years. There was also a 16% decrease in MACE associated with every 10% increase in TTR at 6 months. GSR-DEFINE is a prospective all-comer observational study in 222 sites across 42 countries including 3000 patients from the GSR study and enrolling up to an additional 2000 patients.

Dr. Felix Mahfoud ""Results from this real-world patient setting closely mirror and build upon data from the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED trial showing improved blood pressure control with RDN. The findings from GSR-DEFINE further underscore the long-term safety and effectiveness of the Symplicity system in patients with uncontrolled hypertension while also lowering their risk of major cardiovascular events"" said Prof. Felix Mahfoud M.D. cardiologist at Saarland University Hospital in Homburg Germany and member of the SPYRAL HTN executive committee. About the Medtronic Symplicity Spyral Renal Denervation System

The Medtronic RDN procedure uses a minimally invasive procedure that delivers radiofrequency energy to specific nerves near the kidneys that can become overactive and cause high blood pressure. Approved for commercial use in more than 60 countries around the world the Symplicity Spyral renal denervation system is limited to investigational use in the United States Japan and Canada.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

On Monday Gossamer and the Italy-based Chiesi Farmaceutici announced a collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and eventually sell the drug which is called seralutinib. Gossamer has been testing seralutinib as a potential treatment for an uncommon disease known in short as PAH and is currently recruiting patients in a late-stage clinical trial meant to serve as the basis for approval applications.

PAH or pulmonary arterial hypertension is a form of high blood pressure in the lungs. The pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood over time causing the organ to weaken or even fail. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several blood vessel-widening medicines that help alleviate the symptoms of PAH and more recently cleared a first-of-its-kind therapy from Merck & Co.

Unlike other treatments Merck’s Winrevair inhibits a protein that thickens the walls of blood vessels. The therapy is injected every three weeks and is seen as a valuable product by both Wall Street and Merck which acquired it through an $11.5 billion buyout of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Analysts have predicted Winrevair could generate annual sales anywhere between $1 billion to $8 billion at its peak.

Gossamer believes there’s still room in the market for its drug as it also works differently than available treatment options and comes as an inhaled powder. Results from a smaller PAH study encouraged the company to advance seralutinib into that late-stage trial titled “Prosera” which will enroll 350 participants and complete by late 2025.

While Gossamer remains confident in its drug company investors have questioned the strength of those earlier trial results and whether seralutinib can truly compete with Winrevair. Shares of Gossamer lost three-quarters of their value in late 2022 when findings from the smaller study were announced. As of Monday morning they traded at about 75 cents apiece.

Joseph Schwartz an analyst at investment firm Leerink Partners wrote in a note to clients that the new deal with Chiesi “could address many of the concerns investors have” with Gossamer. Chief among those concerns according to Schwartz is the company’s ability to enroll and fund Prosera.

The collaboration “bodes well” for Gossamer “based on the amount of diligence that typically precedes a collaboration” the analyst wrote.

Story continues

Per deal terms Gossamer will continue leading the development of seralutinib in PAH as well as another related indication the companies are interested in: pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Though Gossamer and Chiesi will evenly split development costs the former is responsible for financing Prosera.

In the U.S. the partners plan to evenly share commercial profits and losses. Gossamer will helm commercialization efforts for those two diseases while Chiesi will take the lead for any additional indications.

Chiesi will also have the exclusive right to commercialize seralutinib outside of the U.S. Gossamer will get mid-to-high teens royalties on net sales.

A nonprofit advocacy group says a researcher's avatar was raped in the metaverse.

Other Meta users have also said they were sexually harassed or abused on the metaverse.

Meta investors wanted a report on the harm metaverse users faced but shareholders rejected the idea.

A researcher entered the metaverse wanting to study users' behavior on Meta's social-networking platform Horizon World. But within an hour of her donning her Oculus virtual reality (VR) headset she says she was raped in the virtual space.

""Metaverse: another cesspool of toxic content"" a new report published by nonprofit advocacy group SumOfUs on May 24 details the researcher's violent encounter in Meta's Horizon World.

According to SumOfUs's account users invited the researcher to a private party on Horizon World earlier this month. Users in the same room then asked her to disable a setting that prevented others from getting within four feet of her

The report linked to a video that the group said shows what happened to the researcher's avatar from her perspective. In the video a male avatar is seen getting very close to her while another male avatar stands nearby watching. A bottle of what appears to be alcohol is then passed between the two avatars per the 28-second video. Two male voices are heard making lewd comments in the video.

In a part of the video SumOfUs opted not to share but describe the researcher ""was led into a private room at a party where she was raped by a user who kept telling her to turn around so he could do it from behind while users outside the window could see – all while another user in the room watched and passed around a vodka bottle"" per the report.

Even though it happened in virtual reality the incident left the researcher ""disoriented"" she said in the report. The researcher noted her controller vibrated when the male avatars touched her resulting in a physical sensation that was a result of what she was experiencing online.

""One part of my brain was like wtf is happening the other part was like this isn't a real body and another part was like this is important research"" she said in the report.

SumOfUs researchers also reported experiencing homophobic and racial slurs in Horizon World and said they witnessed gun violence on the platform.

Meta launched Horizon Worlds last December to users 18 and up in the US and Canada. By February there were at least 300000 users on the platform according to The Verge.

Four other users also recently claimed that their avatars were sexually assaulted or harassed in Horizon World and other Meta's VR platforms according to the SumOfUs report.

In November a beta tester reported that her avatar had been groped on Horizon Worlds.

At the time Meta spokesperson Kristina Milian told the MIT Technology Review that users should have ""a positive experience with safety tools that are easy to find—and it's never a user's fault if they don't use all the features we offer. We will continue to improve our UI and to better understand how people use our tools so that users are able to report things easily and reliably. Our goal is to make Horizon Worlds safe and we are committed to doing that work.""







But the next month metaverse researcher Nina Jane Patem disclosed in a post on Medium that within 60 seconds of her joining Horizon Worlds her avatar was gang-raped by three to four male-looking avatars.

That same month The New York Times reported that a female player's avatar was groped on a Meta-owned shooter game. Separately a player on the sports game Echo VR said a male player told her he had recorded her voice so that he could ""jerk off"" to her cursing.

SumOfUs and Meta did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comments. In response to the SumOfUs report a Meta spokesperson told the Daily Mail it doesn't recommend ""turning off the safety feature with people you do not know.""

At least two major metaverse investors expressed concern over emerging details of harassment and abuse on its metaverse platforms

Meta has staked its future on building its immersive metaverse virtual reality. It plowed $10 billion into designing the metaverse. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is playing the long game with his investment recently saying that the project could continue to lose money for the next three to five years Insider reported.

However at least two major Meta investors were alarmed by emerging details of harassment and abuse on its metaverse platforms.

In December investors Arjuna Capital and Storebrand Asset Management together with SumOfUs and several other advocacy organizations co-filed a motion demanding that Meta publish a report that would examine the potential harms users could face on its metaverse platforms they said in a press release.

""Investors need to understand the scope of these potential harms and weigh in on whether or not this is a good idea before we throw good money after bad"" Arjuna Capital's managing partner Natasha Lamb said in the release.

At Meta's May 25 shareholder's meeting a proposal was introduced to complete a third-party assessment of ""potential psychological and civil and human rights harms to users that may be caused by the use and abuse of the platform"" and ""whether harms can be mitigated or avoided or are unavoidable risks inherent in the technology.""

However the proposal was voted down.

Earlier this month Nick Clegg president for global affairs at Meta Platforms said in a blog post that ""the rules and safety features of the metaverse — regardless of the floor — will not be identical to the ones currently in place for social media. Nor should they be.""

But he continued ""In the physical world as well as the internet people shout and swear and do all kinds of unpleasant things that aren't prohibited by law and they harass and attack people in ways that are. The metaverse will be no different. People who want to misuse technologies will always find ways to do it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MtdGVjaG5vbG9neS9tZXRhLWNvcGllZC12ci10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWtleS10by1tZXRhdmVyc2UtZ2FtaW5nLWltbWVyc2lvbi1jbGFpbXMtNzk0MTk5Mi_SAZIBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGVjaC1uZXdzLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvbWV0YS1jb3BpZWQtdnItdGVjaG5vbG9neS1rZXktdG8tbWV0YXZlcnNlLWdhbWluZy1pbW1lcnNpb24tY2xhaW1zLTc5NDE5OTIvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta copied VR technology key to metaverse gaming immersion claims,"Meta Platforms Inc. built its industry-leading virtual reality headset by infringing Immersion Corp.’s patents the smaller company alleged in a lawsuit.

The Meta Quest 2 which dominates the market infringes six patents covering haptic technology Immersion said in a complaint filed Thursday in federal court in Waco Texas. In video game systems and controllers haptics allow users to experience vibrations that mimic real-life forces — such as blocking a punch in a virtual boxing game.

Immersion is seeking a court order blocking Meta’s use of the infringing technology and unspecified damages.

Meta representatives didn’t immediately respond outside regular business hours to a request for comment.

Immersion which specializes in haptics patents is known for taking on some of the world’s largest companies in licensing disputes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vZXhwbGFpbmVkL3RoZS1rZXktdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLXRoYXQtcG93ZXItdGhlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The key technologies that power the Metaverse,"How does the Metaverse work? Jon Radoff (an entrepreneur novelist and game designer) proposed a seven-tiered conceptual framework to define the Metaverse market's value chain. As per the framework seven layers make up the Metaverse including experience discovery creator economy spatial computing decentralization human interface and infrastructure. Experience The Metaverse will give us a plethora of three-dimensional (3D) visuals and even two-dimensional (2D) experiences that we are currently unable to enjoy. Discovery Inbound and outbound discovery systems continue to exist in the Metaverse ecology. When people are actively hunting for information this is known as inbound discovery. Meanwhile outbound marketing refers to sending communications to people regardless of whether they requested it. Creator economy Creators of earlier incarnations of the internet needed some programming knowledge to design and construct tools. However developing web applications without coding is now possible owing to web application frameworks. As a result the number of web creators is rapidly expanding. Spatial computing Spatial computing refers to a technology that combines VR and AR. Microsoft's HoloLens is an excellent example of what this technology can accomplish. Even if you haven't been able to get your hands on Hololens yet consider face filters on Instagram as an example of spatial computing. Decentralization Developers can leverage online capabilities through a scalable ecosystem enabled by distributed computing and microservices. Moreover smart contracts and the blockchain empower creators to their own data and products. Human interface Users can receive information about their surroundings use maps and even build shared AR experiences by simply gazing around at the physical world using a combination of spatial computing and human interface. Infrastructure Technological infrastructure is critical for the existence of other layers. It includes 5G and 6G computing to reduce network congestion and improve the network's bandwidth.

Which technology is used in the Metaverse? The latest development of the Metaverse was made possible due to technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) the Internet of Things (IoT) AR VR 3d modeling and spatial and edge computing. Artificial intelligence AI paired with Metaverse technology ensures the Metaverse infrastructure's stability while also delivering actionable information for the upper layers. NVIDIA technologies are a good example of how AI will be crucial in developing digital spaces where social interactions will occur in the Metaverse. Internet of things While IoT will allow the Metaverse to study and interact with the real world it will also serve as a 3D user interface for IoT devices allowing for a more personalized IoT experience. Both the Metaverse and the Internet of Things will assist organizations in making data-driven judgments with minimal mental effort. Augmented and virtual reality The idea of a Metaverse combines technologies like AI AR and VR to let users enter the virtual world. For instance virtual items can be embedded in the actual environment using augmented reality technology. Similarly VR helps immerse you in a 3D virtual environment or 3D reconstruction using 3D computer modeling. While wearing a virtual reality headset or other gear isn't required in the Metaverse experts believe VR will become an essential part of the virtual environment. However it is essential to note that the Metaverse is different from AR and VR. If you are curious to know how you can enter the Metaverse the answer is that augmented and virtual reality technologies are a way to get into the dynamic 3D digital world. 3D modeling 3D modeling is a computer graphics approach for creating a three-dimensional digital representation of any surface or object. The Metaverse's 3D reality is crucial to ensuring the comfort of its consumers. A lot of image collecting and graphic design are required to create a 3D world. The 3D graphics in most games like The Sandbox (SAND) provide the impression that the player is actually in the game. The Metaverse needs to be built on the same foundation. Spatial and edge computing The practice of leveraging physical space as a computer interface is known as spatial computing. With technologies like the HoloLens Microsoft is a pioneer in the field of spatial computing in the metaverse space. In contrast edge computing is a network-based cloud computing and service delivery paradigm. Edge provides end-users with computation storage data and application solutions like cloud computing services. To deliver the same level of experience as in reality keeping the user interested and immersed in the Metaverse is critical. In light of this the response time to a user's action should essentially be reduced to a level below what is detectable to humans. By hosting a series and combination of computing resources and communication infrastructures close to the users edge computing provides quick response times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkLzIxLXllYXItb2xkLXdvbWFuLXZpcnR1YWxseS1yYXBlZC1oYXJhc3NlZC1pbi1tZXRhdmVyc2UtcmVwb3J0LTQ4MzA0M9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkLzIxLXllYXItb2xkLXdvbWFuLXZpcnR1YWxseS1yYXBlZC1oYXJhc3NlZC1pbi1tZXRhdmVyc2UtcmVwb3J0LTQ4MzA0My9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,21-year-old woman virtually raped harassed in metaverse: Report,"Metaverse was launched with much fanfare and optimism by Mark Zuckerberg for connecting people online that encompasses augmented and virtual reality.

However as is the case with social media platforms where bullying and cybercrime are rampant Metaverse too has its own share of vices.

According to an online watchdog within an hour of entering the Metaverse a 21-year-old woman was sexually assaulted and harassed virtually.

A report — titled “Metaverse: another cesspool of toxic content” — said that the woman was raped within one hour of being in the metaverse according to a new report from SumOfUs a “nonprofit advocacy organization and online community that campaigns to hold corporations accountable” for a variety of alleged infractions reports Daily Mail.

The unnamed woman who works as a researcher for SumOfUs‚ claimed that her avatar was raped while other users watched after he led her into a private room at a party on “Horizon Worlds”—a metaverse platform released by Meta last December in the US and Canada that allows users to gather with others play games and build their own virtual worlds.

Even though everything is happening virtually the woman could sense the unwanted touch and grope through the VR controllers.

In the Metaverse when a user is touched by another the hand controllers vibrate “creating a very disorienting and even disturbing physical experience during a virtual assault.”

“It happened so fast I kind of disassociated. One part of my brain was like ‘WTF is happening’ the other part was like ‘this isn’t a real body’ and another part was like ‘this is important research’” the unnamed researcher said in the report.

The watchdog also pointed out that “VR users have long reported problems with sexual harassment verbal abuse racial slurs and invasion of personal space on a myriad of apps.”

Responding to the incident a representative for Meta told the Daily Mail “We don’t recommend turning off the safety feature with people you do not know.”

The SumOfUs report also listed other cases of sexual harassment that have occurred in the metaverse.

“Australian news ban took down pages that are not news sources” the note said pointing to blocked government pages fire and emergency services official health pages and domestic violence charities.

“We should be proactive here not reactive given the damage this is doing to Facebook’s reputation in Australia.”

Some pages including the Bureau of Meteorology and 1800Respect were quickly restored but others such as WWF-Australia and Women’s Legal Service were not.

Whistleblowers within Facebook’s parent company Meta have now come forward labelling the move a negotiating tactic in a long-running fight over legislation that would have required Meta and Google to negotiate with news organisations over payment for their content.

The submission from Whistleblower Aid to lawmakers in the US and the competition regulator in Australia was made public this month containing screenshots of the internal Facebook conversation.

A tactic that worked

Facebook’s Australian newsban was the peak of the standoff between Meta and the former Morrison government over its news media bargaining code – the legislation which forces digital platforms to negotiate with news media companies.

Platforms that are “designated” under the code are subject to its terms meaning they must reach an agreement with all media companies that meet the criteria of the code otherwise they must go to an arbiter to determine the level of payment.

Platforms that refuse to negotiate with media companies face fines of $10m or 10% of their annual Australian turnover or three times the benefit obtained – whichever is greatest.

During consultation on the code Meta warned it would mean news would disappear from Facebook. The move to ban it as the legislation was moving through parliament was a show of force.

Publicly the company was arguing that the blocking of non-news pages was an accident but the whistleblowers allege the company deliberately blocked non-news sites as a ploy – one that ultimately worked.

After the news ban the former treasurer Josh Frydenberg and former communications minister Paul Fletcher cut a deal with Meta that stopped it from being designated under the law as long as it could demonstrate it had made deals with enough media companies.

Soon Meta had signed agreements with the largest news publishers in Australia to pay for their news content but because it wasn’t designated under the code it didn’t have to enter agreements with all of them.

Senior Meta executives including CEO Mark Zuckerberg sent out congratulatory emails to the staff involved in the ban.

“This is something we’d been preparing for but the last couple of weeks were intense” Zuckerberg said in a screenshot included in the submission. “We were able to execute quickly and take a principled approach for our community around the world while achieving what might be the best possible outcome in Australia.”

The whistleblowers’ lawyer Andrew Bakaj said the employees felt compelled to speak out to set the record straight about what really went on.

“The motivation was pretty clear in terms of why they did the Australian takedown and how they did it” he told Guardian Australia. “So I think that having experienced that and seeing that the whistleblowers felt that it was time to come forward to set the record straight for the Australian people.”

According to the allegations made in the document Meta had established a specialised internal team to respond to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) which was developing the legislation. Members of the team were required to sign non-disclosure agreements which the whistleblowers have described as outside the norm for the company.

During the shutdown multiple employees outside the team tried to raise the alarm about the blocking of pages other than news but the screenshots of conversations in the submission show they were either ignored or placated even when proposing simple technical solutions that would have quickly restored the wrongly blocked pages.

Meta has refused to comment on the allegations made in the submission.

What’s the long game?

At the time of the news ban Frydenberg said Australia had been a “proxy battle” for the rest of the world on the regulation of Google and Facebook.

“I have no doubt that so many other countries are looking at what is happening here in Australia because of this innovative code the Morrison government is now pursuing so Facebook and Google have not hidden the fact that they know that the eyes of the world are on Australia and that is why they have sought to get a code here that is workable” he said.

Other countries are now looking to replicate what Australia has done but there’s no immediate way to stop Facebook from running the same playbook.

“I think that seeing that this has happened in Australia and effectively they can hold the Australian people and the Australian government hostage … they could do that anywhere” Bakaj said. “This could have repeated itself and I would hope that the likelihood is less now because it’s so public but one can only hope.”

In Australia Meta and Google have signed dozens of deals worth millions to a number of news organisations including Guardian Australia but Meta has been a reluctant negotiator even for those with whom it has struck deals.

Only about 41% of publications in Australia have been able to secure agreements with Meta and the company is refusing to negotiate with at least two larger publishers: the academic news site the Conversation and the multicultural public broadcaster SBS.

There is a renewed push to have Meta designated under the code to force more negotiations with the former ACCC chair Rod Sims calling for Meta to be designated after a Treasury review of the code is completed in September.

The new Labor government had been supportive of the code in opposition but has not yet indicated whether it would make changes.

Bakaj said his team had not had a response from Meta US Congress or the ACCC to the submission but he is hopeful it will spark an investigation. He said in the United States where most of Meta’s operations take place there was close to a bipartisan agreement between Democrats and Republicans that Meta holds too much power but that is as far as it goes.

“There was a legislator who told me ‘Democrats and Republicans do agree that there is a problem with Facebook the problem is they don’t agree on what the solution is’” he said.

“And so there is I think an effort to move forward but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re in lockstep in terms of how to fix it.”"

The controversial wide receiver who was interviewed during a Fan Controlled Football game on Saturday said he is done with the NFL at least for next season.

“Obviously we live the game but you can’t play forever” Brown said. “I think I’m a great player that’s done everything in the game.”

Brown asked if he would suit up in 2022 then said: “Nah don’t play yourself looking at me to play.”

Brown told TMZ in March nearly three months after his controversial exit that he had yet to undergo surgery on his ankle and wouldn’t get it repaired until he signs with a new NFL team.

“I need to get my ankle fixed but I just want to make sure I’ve got an obligation or a commitment from a team” Brown told the website. “It’s a lot for a guy to go through surgery without an idea of where you’re gonna work or who you’re gonna work for. I think as a player I understand that I can do all the things in my physical life and move and function normally.”

Earlier this month Brown said on social media that he wanted to retire as a Steeler but did not want to play for Pittsburgh again. The 33-year-old receiver also was recently caught up in an Instagram drama with R&B singer Keyshia Cole and said in another interview that he didn’t want to be compared to former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

The Eagles gave a concert and hosted a voyage on Saturday night on the Strip.

“This is a three-hour vacation from the real world” founding member Don Henley told the packed crowd at MGM Grand Garden. He later added that the band was celebrating the 50th anniversary of being on the radio with “Take it Easy.”

“It was a fast 50” Henley said. “Thank you for supporting us on this journey.”

Guitarist Joe Walsh was steering his own time machine.

“I had a hell of a lot more fun when I was in my 20s in the ’70s then I do when I’m in my 70s in the ’20s” Walsh said. The crowd cheered that too. They got it. Most of those who crammed into the Grand Garden creating a sea of silver hair could identify.

The band performed “Hotel California” in its entirety then broke for a few minutes (for the inevitable restroom break as Henley called out) then finished with a stream of hits to fill that three-hour performance. The band had started this road trip at MGM Grand Garden Sept. 27-28 and Oct. 5 2019. Bassist Timothy B. Schmit called the arena the band’s Las Vegas home as it has headlined Grand Garden several times over the years following their in 1994 show at Sam Boyd Silver Bowl (now Sam Boyd Stadium) through 2016 with the late Glenn Frey.

Country-rock great Vince Gill has since replaced Frey onstage. The band again played flawless renditions of the full “Hotel California” album released in 1976. The album has since sold 32 million copies (26-times platinum). The hits dropped on the crowd like a springtime rainshower. The sing-alongs were led by the title song “New Kid In Town” “Life in The Fast Lane” the singles from the album.

Post-intermission it was “One Of These Nights” “Take It To The Limit” and “Heartache Tonight.” Walsh had a turn with “Life’s Been Good.” It’s a joy to watch Gill grinning over at the guitarist as he growls through the lyrics “My Maserati goes 185. I lost my license now I don’t drive.” Henley’s brilliant “Boys of Summer” slid into the night’s mellow culmination “Best Of My Love.”

The four primary members bowed it out with Walsh tailing the group and giving a final wave. It might be the last Vegas show for this band for the ages. But we thought that last time and even back to ‘94. But we are sure that by every measurable means they do not make ‘em like the Eagles anymore.

Give it to the locals

The Eagles could well track a 22-person choir and 39-member string section. But no. The band hired Vegas artists to back select numbers on Friday night. Lady Gaga and Michael Buble have also recently filled full orchestras largely with Vegas musicians and Buble also added singers.

Those Las Vegas entertainers who co-starred with the Eagles deserve a nod and also some intense bold-faced action here:

Michelle Johnson’s Desert Angels sang on “The Last Resort.” Those Las Vegas singers were Johnson Cynthia Abney Kathryn Arianoff Danyel Arianna Ryan Baker Avana Christie Lannie Counts Fred Crescente Eileen Deadwiler Viqtory Destined Aretha Harden Robert Hyatt Patty Janura Amanda Kaiser Jen Mrozik Christopher Lash Naomi Mauro Caleb McKee Karen Michaels Jennifer Mrozik Carol Pritchard Ethena Profit. Hector Ramos and Robin Vincent.

And from the Angela Chan-Stopa contracted Sin City Strings (“I don’t name ‘em I just read what’s on the teleprompter” Henley said) we had:

Violins: Alexandria Pritchard Ferenc Cseszko Nataliya Karachentseva James Harvey Christina Levi De Ann Letourneau Susan Kim Geri Thompson Adriana Thurber-Shaw Chandra Meibalane Peter Goomroyan Shakeh Ghoukasian Kevork Mikaelian Melanie Schiemer and Erika Syroid.

Violas: Tianna Harjo John Pollock Dmitri Kourka Carlene San Filipo Omar Shelly Taras Krysa Ivie Etkins-Turner Yunior Lopez Crystal Yuan and Hope Bowden

Cellos: Lindsey Springer Moonlight Tran Mandy Andreasen Elena Kapustina Mert Sermet Mariko Muranaka Jeremy Russo Ted Hartwell and Andy Smith.

Double Bass: Ryan Dudder Paul Firak Chris Davis and Josh Jones.

“It was surreal” Johnson said after the show. “It was incredible to be singing along with songs you have listened to your whole life.” Springer who has performed with Celine Dion among a host of other superstars called it “The show of a lifetime!” Can’t argue that.

May 29 2022 Jon Sofen Senior Editor U.S.

Getting to and from the 2022 World Series of Poker (WSOP) will be a bit more complicated than in year's past given the switch from the Rio to the Strip and one method of transportation you might wish to consider is the monorail.

The Rio whether you loved it or hated it was conveniently located off the Strip but nearby and the parking lot just outside the WSOP area doors was spacious enough to be replaced by a Major League Baseball stadium (there were even rumors of this happening).

Moving forward those luxuries are gone but that doesn't mean attending the WSOP on the busy Las Vegas Strip will be a nuisance. It just means that players media and visitors must make some adjustments in their planning starting with the method in which they travel to and from Bally's and Paris the new World Series of Poker host site.

What is the Las Vegas Strip Monorail?

Poker players competing in the 2022 WSOP will be staying all around the city in hotels AirBnB's and of course their own homes. And not everyone will have a car to drive to Bally's or want to pay the hefty parking fees (up to $23 per day for those who don't have at least a Caesars Rewards Platinum card).

So how do you avoid those fees and heavy Las Vegas Strip traffic? One option is the monorail a quick and convenient solution depending upon where you're staying.

The monorail is located on the east side of the Strip and runs north and south. Due to the route running behind the casinos facing Koval Lane instead of Las Vegas Boulevard (The Strip) the drop-off and pick-up spots can be found in the back of the casinos. Monorail trains arrive approximately every 4 to 8 minutes with station announcements to keep you up to speed on the next arrival time.

The Las Vegas Monorail Map

There are seven stops along the route including one at Bally's. Starting from the south end of the Strip the first (or last if you're traveling from the north) train stop is at MGM Grand followed by Bally's & Paris Flamingo Harrah's & The Linq Las Vegas Convention Center Westgate and Sahara.

The monorail is a convenient and cost-efficient way to move about the Strip without having to pay Uber/taxi and parking fees or walk a mile (or longer) in the 110-degree summer heat.

For those who are staying on the Strip but not at one of the hotels near Bally's the monorail just might be your best option in terms of expenses and convenience.

Cost Hours and Discount for Locals

Las Vegas Strip monorail stop at MGM Grand.

The monorail costs $5 per ride $13 for 24 hours of unlimited use $23 for a two-day pass $36 for a four-day pass and $56 for a seven-day pass. Children five-and-under ride for free.

There is a significant discount available for locals. If you present a Nevada ID to the cashier you can purchase up to two rides per day for $1 each. You must show your ID and provide a phone number at the time of purchase. Should you require more than two rides in a single day you'll have to pay regular fare for the additional rides.

Discounts for locals can only be purchased from a cashier which can occasionally be a problem if that employee at the stop you're at is on break. For everyone else you can buy your tickets online at lvmonorail.com or from the kiosks available at each train stop.

Monorail Costs

Ticket Type Price Single Ride $USD 5.00 24 Hour Pass $USD 13.00 2-Day Pass $USD 23.00 3-Day Pass $USD 29.00 4-Day Pass $USD 36.00 5-Day Pass $USD 43.00 7-Day Pass $USD 56.00

Monorail hours are fairly convenient for tournament poker players except on Mondays — only runs 7 a.m. to midnight. Tuesday to Thursday the hours are 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. to 3 a.m. Friday to Sunday.

The train runs frequently so you'll never have a long wait when you're in a hurry. It only takes a minute or two to go from one stop to the next. You could conceivably hop on the monorail on dinner break and return to your hotel room to eat depending on where you're staying and make it back in time.

Where to Catch the Monorail

As mentioned there are seven stops along the route on the east side of Las Vegas Boulevard. That means if you're staying at a hotel on the west side of the Strip (Luxor for example) you'll have to walk across the street and then through the nearest casino with a monorail stop to hop on board.

This can be a bit of an inconvenience for those staying in certain hotels. Take for example Mandalay Bay which is located at the furthest south end of the Strip on the west side of LVB. In this case your hike to the closest monorail stop (MGM Grand) is about a half mile and even a bit further in actual walking distance once you factor in moving through MGM Grand to get to the train.

That said your walk won't be too long to the monorail from most Strip hotels.

The pick-up and drop-off spot at Bally's is fairly convenient for those competing in the World Series of Poker. It will take approximately five minutes to walk to the train stop from the Bally's convention area and add a few extra minutes if you're playing over in the Paris convention area.

The train stop is located downstairs right by the Bally's pool entrance.

Comparing Transportation Options

Taking the monorail back and forth from your hotel to the WSOP is really only convenient for those staying on the Strip at hotels that are a decent hike to Bally's and Paris. Or for those who don't want to move their parked cars to grab a bite to eat on dinner break outside the WSOP area.

Poker players who have a Platinum or higher Caesars Rewards card and a car in Las Vegas would be better off driving to and parking at Bally's because it's free.

There are two major parking facilities and valet services available to guests:

Paris Las Vegas Parking Garage — Park here walk the path take the escalator and you will end up right next to the Paris Conference Center (where the Main WSOP Cage cash games and Day 1 tables are located)

— Park here walk the path take the escalator and you will end up right next to the Paris Conference Center (where the Main WSOP Cage cash games and Day 1 tables are located) Bally’s Parking Lot (located directly behind Bally’s with access off either Koval Lane or Flamingo) – Park here walk upstairs into the Bally’s Event Center (where all Final Tables streaming and TV production Day 2 and restart tables are located)

(located directly behind Bally’s with access off either Koval Lane or Flamingo) – Park here walk upstairs into the Bally’s Event Center (where all Final Tables streaming and TV production Day 2 and restart tables are located) Valet services will also be available at the main hotel entrances of both properties.

How Much Is It to Park?

Hours Cost 1st Hour free 1 - 3 Hours $15 3 - 24 Hours $18 Over 24 hours per day $18 Hotel Lodger $18

Locals with valid Nevada ID: Rates apply after the first 3 hours excluding during event pricing

Caesars Rewards Platinum Diamond Seven Stars: Free

Rates on Friday and Saturday increase to $23/day for non-lodgers but remain at $18/day for hotel guests.

Reduced price weekly parking passes for extended stays are available for purchase at the WSOP Main Cage inside the Champagne Ballroom in Paris for $100 a 40% discount.

Caesars Rewards Credit Card: Free. Apply for free at the Caesars Rewards Desk inside Caesars Palace or Planet Hollywood.

There are some other transportation options to attend the WSOP for those staying on the Strip. First off you can always walk and get some exercise which is also a great way to clear your mind after a rough poker session. Keep in mind however it's going to be sunny and scalding hot outside nearly every single day in Las Vegas during the series and there's very little shade in the desert.

Uber Lyft and taxis are available at every hotel but those are far more expensive and arguably less convenient than the monorail. One other alternative for those staying on the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard is the multiple free trams available.

If you're staying at Mandalay Bay or Luxor you can avoid any transportation expenses by taking the free tram from Mandalay (or Luxor) to Excalibur and then walking from there to Aria/Park MGM (takes about 10 minutes) to catch another free tram to Bellagio. All you'll have to do from there is to walk through the Bellagio shops and across the walkway to Bally's to reach the WSOP.

Getting to and from the World Series of Poker isn't one-size fits all. But there are numerous options available so choose the best one for your situation.

This week we’d like to take a look at the career of another stand up comic whose haters cannot manage to rob him of any sleep on his king-sized bed made of cash - Carrot Top.

Scott Thompson better known as Carrot Top has always been the redheaded stepchild of the stand up comedy community. The prop comic has been a punchline at the hands of people who think that prop comedy is “hack” and who would rather laugh at Carrot Top than with him. Despite the nay-sayers Carrot Top’s massive success over his almost 40 year career has earned him a net worth of a whopping $75 million making him the the most wealthy working comedian who we’re “supposed” to feel ashamed for liking.

Like many comedians Carrot Top came from humble beginnings - only the son of a NASA engineer and the brother of a fighter pilot he crawled from his meek roots in Cocoa Florida to Florida Atlantic University in nearby Boca Raton the “Harvard of Florida” as he would say. Carrot Top tried comedy for the first time at a campus open mic during his freshman year quickly taking a liking to the craft more so than his studies.

As far as we can tell the first instance of Carrot Top tapping into his propensity for props was at one such show. Said Carrot Top “The street in the center of town was Butts Road. I stole the sign and told the audience ‘This must be where the a-holes live.’” This got a huge laugh maybe the most consequential laugh of his career as it set him down the path of object-assisted bits. After the show he said “I went home and thought up more visual jokes coming up with props like high heels with training wheels for young girls.”

From there Carrot Top’s prop repertoire grew exponentially. He graduated from Florida Atlantic University in 1983 took some odd jobs and worked at his act until he had two entire trunks full of specialized props. He almost quit comedy after working at it for years with limited success but he was too drawn to the stage to escape it for any extended period of time.

He wouldn’t book a gig outside of the Sunshine State until 1990 when he appeared at a nightclub in North Carolina but that one show was all he needed to get his foot in the door. A talent manager approached him that same night and helped him take his act across the country.

Carrot Top made his first appearance on TV just a year later when he booked Comic Strip Live a televised showcase of the top acts at New York’s historic Comic Strip comedy club. A year after that Carrot Top landed his first of over two dozen appearances on The Tonight Show.

The ‘90s would end up being very kind to Carrot Top. His brand exploded and he toured the country playing to sold out venues. The trunk full of props evolved into a full truckload as he says – “I went from two trunks and a strobe light to an 18-wheeler and 35 trunks…from a Yugo to a tour bus for the crew and myself. Now I have people who carry my props.”

Carrot Top became a household name. He was the continuity announcer for Cartoon Network for four years and even had his own show on the channel a short-lived morning show called Carrot Top’s AM Mayhem. Numerous TV cameos and Late Night appearances peppered his peak as well as a starring role in the feature length film Chairman of the Board.

But around that time in the mid ‘90s it was very much “in vogue” for comedians and comedy fans alike to turn their noses up at anything considered “hack”. Hacks were second only to sell-outs on the list of the lamest things an entertainer could be in the ‘90s and many people saw Carrot Top as a gimmick comedian not worthy of the fame he enjoyed.

The late great Norm MacDonald was one of those people at least for the duration of this Conan interview in 1997:

Carrot Top was an easy target. His boundless enthusiasm and peculiar appearance paired with what some snooty people would call a “cheap” style drew the negative attention of some of the most prominent figures in comedy. Trey Parker and Matt Stone of Southpark were no fans of his nor was Mike Judge writer and creator of King of the Hill who parodied his act with the character of Celery Head a grating witless and unfunny prop comic with a familiar hairdo.

To Norm’s credit Chairman of the Board was an absolute flop and although it is unfair to pin its failure squarely on Carrot Top Hollywood had judged him to be unmarketable and his film career stalled out. Carrot Top would make guest appearances on TV shows and movies throughout the 2000’s but to the delight of his haters those spots would become fewer and farther between as the years went on.

But Carrot Top’s allure was never going to translate on camera – his theatricality fits theaters not screens which is why in 2005 Carrot Top signed on with MGM Resorts International and began his residency at the Luxor in Las Vegas a stage where he remains to this day. Carrot Top is the perfect comedian for Vegas since his shows look more like rock concerts than stand up sets.

Carrot Top made his fortune in Vegas and has shown no interest in ending his historic 17 year run a gig he’s called the “move that every comic dreams of.” We’re not going to make the claim that “successful = objectively good” but if you are one of those people who hates Carrot Top please contemplate whether you hate the comic himself or if you just can’t stand the idea of a comedian using visual aids.

According to Carrot Top ""(Jerry) Seinfeld came up to me one time and said `I really dig your stuff. I like the fact that the prop isn't the laugh. The laugh comes when I start acting on the prop."" This is the essence of his act the props are there to support his enthusiasm and his wit not the other way around. If Seinfeld can appreciate him then so can you. Maybe?

Not only is White a powerful man but he is also very influential.

The UFC stopped doing events at the palms after The Ultimate Fighter and certain UFC Fights used to take place at the palms for a long time. Recently in an episode of his podcast Rogan revealed the reason behind it.

On an episode of his podcast Rogan said “This was back when it was the palms…He won so much money I think the most he has ever won is $7million…like he is really wealthy. So for him to feel it to get that charge he is got to be betting big money.”

He further added “So he won so much money that they told him he is banned from the casino. And he said oh really? Guess what else is banned? And he pulled the UFC out of the palms.”

“So UFC we used to do The Ultimate Fighter and some of the smaller shows we do it at the palms and he pulled it from the palms…They told him he can’t gamble there he is like oh guess what else I can’t do here? I can’t have fights here.”

Why is Joe Rogan So Important to the UFC?

This story narrated by Rogan is a testament to the power and influence of Dana White. Even during the pandemic when every sporting event was shut down White and the UFC continued putting up events.

Dana White gave rise to UFC Fight Island

In 2020 because of the outbreak of the pandemic every sporting event around the globe came to a halt. While the future remained uncertain the one man who proceeded ahead and continued hosting events was UFC President Dana White.

While talking to TMZ Sports White said that he was a day or two away from securing a private island to conduct the fights. He said that since he could not fly in international fighters to the USA; he secured a private island to conduct fights from there. Although he did not reveal the location at first UFC Fight Island took place at Yas Island in Abu Dhabi.

The first event that took place at UFC Fight Island was UFC 251: Usman vs Masvidal. Since then Fight Island has played host in many successful PPV events and fight night events.

Moreover this move by Dana White to conduct fights in closed doors while maintaining all safety protocols is proof of his love and passion for Mixed Martial Arts. Credit to the UFC President and his team for putting up events in a time of crisis for people around the world to enjoy.

The information comes from Ukrainian intelligence. Some of the Russian weapons systems seized by the Ukrainians since the beginning of the war have been dismantled and the facts have been established.

The chips found in the Russian Kh-101 missile were manufactured by Texas Instruments Atmel Corp. Rochester Electronics Cypress Semiconductor Maxim Integrated XILINX Infineon Technologies Intel Onsemi and Micron Technology. A complete list of used American microchips has been sent to the Pentagon.

Ukrainian intelligence also claims that the Kh-101 is not a precedent. The Russian 9S932-1 a radar-equipped air defense command post vehicle that is part of the larger Barnaul-T system a Pantsir air defense system and the Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopter are also full of US-made chips. The total number of chips found in the listed weapons systems is 35 and together with those of the Kh-101 missile it is clear that in only four weapons systems the Russians have integrated 70 US-made microchips.

So far we do not know how many of Russia’s weapons systems developed in recent decades use US-made microchips but the components of Ukrainian intelligence found in the four weapons cited raise a logical question: Does Russia have the ability to produce critical components and semiconductors?

Despite the sanctions imposed on the Russian economy in recent years [since 2014 after the annexation of Crimea] in some way these chips have gone to Russian weapons developers and designers. There is no evidence of direct sales between the United States and Russia. This market is difficult to regulate: Moscow may have bought the chips from third parties. Another possibility is that these chips were delivered from China as this country is a world leader in chip recycling. However there are two other possibilities: someone has violated the provisions of the imposed economic sanctions or the chips are simply not military.

Experts in the United States [such as Skip Parish] are already saying that Western Western technology in Russian weapons speaks to two main things: “Russia’s dependence on Western technology” and “US failure or non-existent control of international arms trafficking rules.”

Let’s look at the situation with the Kh-101 stealth attack cruise missile. The two photos below show only part of the 35 microchips found in the rocket. Experts from BulgarianMilitary.com found that they look like microchips produced in the ’60s and ’70s in the United States. This confirms one of the supposed possibilities i.e. opportunity for recycled chips from China.

A Ukrainian expert says the chips used in the Kh-101 stealth attack cruise missile may not have been recycled in China but in the former Soviet-era plant the Voronezh Radio Parts Plant the Minsk Plant or the Integral Plant.

Phoot: Twitter

There is evidence that a significant number of Kh-101 missiles fired on the territory of Ukraine do not hit the targets which again raises the question: how old are the US-made chips discovered and how effective combined with Russian technology?

Microchips from the American company Onsemi have been found in some of Russia’s weapons systems. However the company is not responsible for this as this company does not produce military microchips but products that are publicly available on international civilian markets. The company cannot be blamed for anything. Other US companies have responded to allegations that they have not worked with the Russian market for a long time or that they do not find their products in the cited weapons systems.

All this raises a general question: if Russia buys chips and recycled Western chips from China are technology sanctions against Russia effective? Especially against the background of the fact that as it turned out some microchips can be found in the neighborhood store or the most ordinary online store.

Russia’s Most Advanced Weapons Are Shockingly Packed With ‘American Components’ — Ukrainian Intelligence,"Ukraine has revealed the use of US-made microchips in the Russian military hardware thereby raising questions about Moscow’s ability to produce the technological components.

When the Ukrainian military started dismantling Russian weapons many pieces of captured or partially destroyed equipment had an abundant use of foreign microchips particularly those manufactured in the US.

According to the list of components shared by Ukrainian Intelligence with The War Zone Ua US defense portal the chips were found inside a recovered example of the 9S932-1 a radar-equipped air defense command post vehicle that is part of the larger Barnaul-T system a Pantsir air defense system a Ka-52 “Alligator” attack helicopter and a Kh-101 (AS-23A Kodiak) cruise missile.

List Of Components

Barnaul-T is Russia’s most high-end air defense command and control subsystem within the larger integrated system for air defense of the Russian Army Marine units and Airborne forces.

The 9S932-1 is a radar-equipped reconnaissance/control module of the Barnaul-T subsystem which conducts round-the-clock reconnaissance and exercises command and control of subordinate troops and their armaments in warfare on combat positions.

This module is directly linked to units equipped with various Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) Systems including Tor-M-series (SA-15) and 9K35 Strela (SA-13) surface-to-air missile systems 9K33 Osa (SA-8) wheeled surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems 2K22 Tunguska (SA-19) tracked air defense systems and 9K333 Verba (SA-25) MANPAD systems.

The Ukrainian Intelligence said they found eight micro-chips in the communications systems of the 9S932-1 module sourced from US manufacturers like Intel Micrel Micron Technology and Atmel Corp.

The Pantsir air defense system is a well-known medium-range SAM and an anti-aircraft artillery system. The Ukrainian specialists reportedly found five US-made chips – manufactured by AMD Rochester Electronics Texas Instruments and Linear Technology – inside the direction finder of this air defense system.

The Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM) have been in the news for their unexpectedly high rate of failure in long-range attacks against Ukrainian targets. In the words of a US Defense official during a briefing in March “either they’re failing to launch or they’re failing to hit the target or they’re failing to explode on contact”.

In addition to the reportedly high failure rates the Kh-101 also appears to be heavily dependent on foreign-made chips as the Ukrainian intelligence claimed to have found at least 35 US-made chips including those manufactured by Texas Instruments Atmel Corp.

The high rate of failures and latest findings of such heavy dependence on foreign chips in Kh-101 ALCM should be concerning for Moscow as the missile’s Kh-102 variant is the Russian Air Force’s main air-launched nuclear-armed cruise missile.

Coming to the Ka-52 Alligator Russia’s twin-seat all-weather attack helicopter the Ukrainian specialists opened up its turreted electro-optical system in which they found 22 US-made chips and one Korean-made chip.

The US manufacturers included Texas Instruments IDT Altera USA Burr-Brown Analog Devices Inc. Micron Technology Linear Technology and TE Connectivity.

Chips Not Necessarily Sourced From Manufacturers

These chips may not have necessarily been sourced directly from the manufacturers as there is a massive and unregulated market for recycled chips emerging from China which could be a more likely source of these chips as many of them appear to be quite old according to Ukrainian specialists.

Also as reported earlier by EurAsian Times researchers in the UK revealed in April that Russia has been sourcing British-made dual-use components such as electronic chips and switchboards for its weaponry through intermediary businesses in India and China.

Earlier this month Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo who recently met Ukraine’s Prime Minister said during a Senate hearing “We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground it’s filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators.”

Components found in weapon systems are difficult to prevent from falling into the wrong hands but experts say that the US officials do have the authority to prevent shipments of such dual-use chips.

NATO Members Arming Russia?

The news comes after an astounding revelation in late April that how NATO members had used the ‘Grandfather Clause’ to bypass the EU embargo on Moscow.

According to an EU report at least ten NATO member states exported around €350 million ($378.6 million) in military hardware to Vladimir Putin’s regime out of which German and French companies accounted for 78 percent with €273 million ($295.4 million) worth of military export.

Despite an EU-wide embargo on arms supplies to Russia after the latter annexed Crimea in 2014 Germany and France delivered bombs rockets missiles and guns to Moscow.

In addition the French companies also delivered thermal imaging cameras as well as navigation systems for fighter aircraft attack helicopters and Russian tanks.

These member states took advantage of a loophole that allowed contracts signed before August 1 2014 or subsequent contracts that would help close those agreements to continue.

That said the latest findings have exposed the heavy dependence of Russian war machines on western technology in key sensitive areas such as targeting navigation communications and control systems of the weapons which could be deeply unsettling for Moscow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FnYWRnZXQuY29tL2VuLzEzNDUwOC1hbWVyaWNhbi1taWNyb2NoaXBzLWZvdW5kLWluLWNhcHR1cmVkLXJ1c3NpYW4tbWlsaXRhcnktZXF1aXBtZW50LWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS_SAXFodHRwczovL2dhZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9lbi8xMzQ1MDgtYW1lcmljYW4tbWljcm9jaGlwcy1mb3VuZC1pbi1jYXB0dXJlZC1ydXNzaWFuLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWVxdWlwbWVudC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American microchips found in captured Russian military equipment - intelligence,Not only Fallout: 7 series based on the plot of computer games that are also worthy of attention,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9waGlzb24tZTI2LXBjaWUtZ2VuLTUtc3NkLWNvbnRyb2xsZXItc2Vlbi1pbi1hY3Rpb24tb24tYXN1cy1yb2cteDY3MGUtaGVyby1tb3RoZXJib2FyZC13aXRoLWFtZC1yeXplbi03MDAwLWNwdS_SAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vcGhpc29uLWUyNi1wY2llLWdlbi01LXNzZC1jb250cm9sbGVyLXNlZW4taW4tYWN0aW9uLW9uLWFzdXMtcm9nLXg2NzBlLWhlcm8tbW90aGVyYm9hcmQtd2l0aC1hbWQtcnl6ZW4tNzAwMC1jcHUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phison E26 PCIe Gen 5 SSD Controller Seen In Action on ASUS ROG X670E HERO Motherboard With AMD Ryzen 7000 CPU Up To 12.5 GB/s Read Speeds,"Earlier this week Phison demoed its flagship E26 PCIe Gen 5 SSD controller on an ASUS ROG X670E HERO motherboard running a prototype AMD Ryzen 7000 CPU.

Phison Demos Next-Gen PCIe Gen 5.0 E26 SSD Controller on ASUS's ROG X670E HERO Motherboard With AMD Ryzen 7000 CPU

While we are expecting over 14 GB/s speeds for the enterprise segment it looks like consumer-tier PCIe Gen 5.0 SSDs won't be much far behind in terms of sequential read and write performance. In the demo Phison tested a PCIe Gen 5.0 SSD engineering sample featuring their upcoming E26 SSD controller and Micron's latest 3D TCL NAND Flash memory.

Tested Engineering Sample: Phison PCIe Gen5 E26 controller + Micron 3D TLC NAND Compatible with Two Leading Chipset Platforms Phison’s PCIe Gen5 SSD Controller E26 Reaches over 12GB/s and 10GB/s in Read and Write Performance via Phison

The demo system was running on a proprietary Phison test board which allows them to evaluate & test next-generation PCIe Gen 5.0 SSDs. The platform utilized for this demonstration was running an ASUS ROG X670E HERO motherboard with a prototype AMD Ryzen 7000 Desktop CPU. In terms of performance the demo yielded a sequential read of up to 12.5 GB/s and a sequential write rated at 10 GB/s. These are some blistering fast speeds compared to the maximum 7-7.5 GB/s speeds on current PCIe Gen 4.0 SSDs.

Phison can also be seen evaluating the same PCIe Gen 5.0 NVMe SSD on an Gigabyte Z690 AERO D board that utilizes an Intel Alder Lake-S Desktop CPU. Both the AMD Ryzen 7000 and Intel Alder Lake Desktop CPUs support native PCIe Gen 5.0 lanes and will be able to support such high-end SSDs when they launch later this year. Phison has already announced a collaboration with AMD to usher in the era of Gen 5 SSDs for the consumer segment.

Last week Microsoft responded with a promise to change its licensing to make this situation fairer. On Tuesday this week the company clarified that these changes don't apply to the serious rivals - ie the two largest ones Google and AWS.

Microsoft has revealed the small print in its response to an EU probe into possible antitrust activity in the cloud. If you run Office Windows and other products on the rival AWS or Google clouds Microsoft will still charge you extra.

""[The upcoming licensing is] aimed at increasing the opportunities and benefits for cloud providers other than hyperscale cloud companies"" Microsoft spokesman Stark Sutton said in an email reported on TechRepublic.

Microsoft president Brad Smith promised to alter its practices after the complaint so that Windows and Office customers can run the software in more ways on their own infrastructure and public clouds. This was in response to principles proposed by CISPE a European cloud service provider group that includes Amazon.

Brad posted an epic-length blog post about the changes while keeping the details obscure. Now it emerges that businesses will still have to pay extra for the privilege of running Office. Windows SQL Server or other products on AWS or Google.

""I want to see the goods"" said a comment from Francisco Mingorance secretary-general of CISPE quoted in TechRepublic.

Mingorance called on Microsoft to share the full new licensing language available for an audit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5kb3dzY2VudHJhbC5jb20vZ2FtaW5nL3hib3gvZXhjbHVzaXZlLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1jb250aW51ZXMtdG8taXRlcmF0ZS1vbi1hbi14Ym94LWNsb3VkLXN0cmVhbWluZy1zdGljay1jb2RlbmFtZWQta2V5c3RvbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: Microsoft continues to iterate on an Xbox cloud streaming device codenamed 'Keystone',"For a few years rumors have persisted that Microsoft was exploring building some form of streaming stick to offer Xbox Cloud Gaming via a more affordable dongle similarly to Chromecast and Google Stadia. The first hint was Project Hobart. More recently a code name ""Keystone"" appeared in an Xbox OS list lending fire to rumors that Microsoft was continuing to explore additional hardware for the Xbox lineup.

We can now confirm that that is indeed true and it pertains to a modernized HDMI streaming device that runs Xbox Game Pass and its cloud gaming service. Microsoft is however taking some time to explore additional iterations of the product before bringing it to market.

XBOX KEYSTONE pic.twitter.com/warAwisfKhMarch 9 2022

In a statement provided to Windows Central a Microsoft spokesperson described its commitment to lowering boundaries to Xbox content via low cost-hardware while acknowledging that the existing version of Keystone needs a little more time to bake before going live.

“Our vision for Xbox Cloud Gaming is unwavering our goal is to enable people to play the games they want on the devices they want anywhere they want. As announced last year we’ve been working on a game-streaming device codename Keystone that could be connected to any TV or monitor without the need for a console"" a Microsoft spokesperson stated.

""As part of any technical journey we are constantly evaluating our efforts reviewing our learnings and ensuring we are bringing value to our customers. We have made the decision to pivot away from the current iteration of the Keystone device. We will take our learnings and refocus our efforts on a new approach that will allow us to deliver Xbox Cloud Gaming to more players around the world in the future.”

From what we understand Keystone has been in development for a couple of years with Microsoft continuing to finalize the product's feature set.

This fan render from 4chan appeared last year in a supposed leak for the streaming device. We've confirmed that these aren't real but give us a glimpse at what a streaming device from Xbox might look like. (Image credit: @ElrondGaming (via 4chan))

To speculate Keystone could eventually run some sort of slimmed-down Windows or Xbox OS given that ""Keystone"" originally appeared in an OS list alongside the different Xbox platforms like ""ERA"" and ""GameOS."" Utilizing Windows instead of alternatives like Android would allow Microsoft to offer its own streaming media apps like Microsoft Movies & TV. Although using Android OSP would potentially be a quicker route to market leaning on apps like Netflix and perhaps Spotify.

The exact timeline for Keystone remains unclear but I wouldn't expect to see it any time soon — particularly not at the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase coming up on June 12.

A low-cost streaming device makes obvious sense from a business perspective as Microsoft pushes to bring Xbox Game Pass to more households who perhaps aren't interested in owning a full-blown console. Microsoft has also previously hinted at bringing TV apps for Xbox Cloud Gaming as well which would lower the barrier even further.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy90aGlzLTQwLXllYXItb2xkLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1leGNlbC1yaXZhbC1pcy1tYWtpbmctYS1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWNvbWViYWNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This 40-year-old Microsoft Excel rival is making a surprising comeback,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.techradar.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/this-40-year-old-microsoft-excel-rival-is-making-a-surprising-comeback (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002533D606F20>, 'Connection to www.techradar.com timed out.

Oh wait.

Yes a security researcher revealed this week that even DuckDuckGo which markets itself as ""the internet privacy company"" made an exception for its business partner Microsoft to its browser's blocking of some advertising trackers on websites sparking accusations of betraying its purported privacy ethos. The milkshake-ducking of DuckDuckGo comes amid a rising awareness of how the stakes of online surveillance are rising as signs grow that the US Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade’s protections on abortion rights: A new report this week from the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project laid out all the technological means available to law enforcement and private litigants to surveil those seeking abortions should Roe be struck down. And more than 40 members of Congress called on Google to stop tracking location data in Android ahead of a potential Roe reversal.

In other privacy news we looked at how the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation has failed to meaningfully curb Big Tech's privacy abuses four years after its passage. Australia's digital driver’s licenses turn out to be far too easy to forge. China has been saber-rattling with accusations about American cyberespionage. We spoke to the inventor of the browser ""cookie"" about how to handle cookie settings for privacy—and those ubiquitous cookie-related pop-ups on websites. And we also interviewed the CEO of Protonmail now rebranded as just Proton about its ambitions to offer a broader range of privacy-focused services beyond email—hopefully without ahem surveillance exceptions for its business partners.

But there's more. As usual we’ve rounded up all the news that we didn’t break or cover in-depth this week. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.

Cybersecurity and privacy researcher Zach Edwards discovered a glaring hole in the privacy protections of DuckDuckGo's purportedly privacy-focused browser: By examining the browser's data flows on Facebook-owned website Workplace.com Edwards found that the site's Microsoft-placed tracking scripts continued to communicate back to Microsoft-owned domains like Bing and LinkedIn. DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg responded to Edwards on Twitter admitting that ""our search syndication agreement prevents us from stopping Microsoft-owned scripts from loading""—essentially admitting that a partnership deal DuckDuckGo struck with Microsoft includes creating a carveout that lets Microsoft track users of its browsers. Weinberg added that DuckDuckGo is ""working to change that."" (A company spokesperson reiterated in an email to WIRED Weinberg's assertion that none of this applies to DuckDuckGo search adding that both its search and its browser offer more privacy protections than the competition.) In the meantime the revelation blew a glaring hole of its own in the company's reputation as a rare privacy-preserving tech firm. Turns out this surveillance capitalism thing is pretty hard to escape.

Staying on that surveillance capitalism theme Twitter agreed this week to pay a $150 million fine after the Federal Trade Commission and the US Department of Justice accused it of selling user data that it had collected under the guise of security. Twitter had asked users to share the emails and phone numbers for security purposes such as two-factor authentication and account recovery but had ultimately sold the data to advertisers seeking to target ads to its users. That bait-and-switch violated an agreement Twitter made with the FTC in 2011 after earlier privacy misbehavior.

If the world had any doubts that China's""re-education camps"" for Muslim minorities in its Xinjiang region were in fact prisons with euphemistic names a massive leak known as the Xinjiang Police Files should correct that delusion. The leak provided by an unknown source to researcher Adrien Zenz who in turn provided the info to a group of global media outlets includes a vast collection of tens of thousands of internal files manuals and even detailed photos revealing life in one of Xinjiang's prisons. The files reveal for instance shoot-to-kill orders for any prisoner attempting to escape the camps and guidelines for shackling the inmates when they're transferred between different parts of the facility—hardly the practices of a ""vocational school"" as China describes the camps to the world. It also includes photos of the camp's detainees who were as young as 15 and as old as 73 often jailed for years without trial for offenses as simple as studying Islamic texts.

In a strange replay of events from 2016 Google researchers and the UK government revealed that a site publishing leaked documents from a group of pro-Brexit UK politicians was in fact created by Russia-based hackers. The site called Very English Coop d'Etat described its collection of leaked emails as coming from an influential group of hardline right-wing Brexit supporters including former MI6 head Richard Dearlove. But Google's Threat Analysis Group told Reuters that the site appears to have been created by a Russian hacker group it calls Cold River. Former UK intelligence head Dearlove cautioned that the leak of his emails should be understood to be a Russian influence operation especially given the West's current icy relations with Russia over its illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

An accidentally unsealed warrant spotted by Forbes revealed that an Iraqi man had allegedly sought to assassinate former president George W. Bush in Dallas going so far as to take video of Bush's home in November. According to the warrant the FBI says it foiled the plot through the use of a confidential informant and surveillance of the would-be assassin's WhatsApp messages' metadata. The case shows how despite law enforcement's claims that end-to-end encryption can stymy its investigations the FBI has managed to monitor encrypted apps like WhatsApp and even penetrate communications on them through the use of undercover informants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN0b3JlLXNvbWV0aGluZy1oYXBwZW5lZC1vbi1vdXItZW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"How to Fix the ""Something Happened on Our End"" Error in the Microsoft Store","ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN0b3JlLXNvbWV0aGluZy1oYXBwZW5lZC1vbi1vdXItZW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

At that point “it felt very far away” he told Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell during a panel at South by Southwest in Austin this past March. “There was still this sense that you could keep it at bay. But it [quickly] became clear that this thing was going to spread like wildfire. It was not going to be stoppable.”

At the end of February Hoge and his team gathered in a conference room and began formulating an action plan debating if they should go all in.

“We knew it would shut down global economies. Millions of people were going to die” he said. “It started getting really dark. And then we thought well can we solve it?”

The solution: manufacturing a billion doses of an mRNA vaccine—and very fast. But to pull it off Hoge and his team knew that they would have to essentially bet the entire future of the company on one vaccine.

It paid off. “We never once looked back” he said. “It was an all-or-nothing moment for us.”

Leadership gut check

Hoge who started his career as a medical doctor before joining McKinsey as a consultant took a role at Moderna in 2012 as senior vice president of corporate development in the new oncology drugs concepts segment. The biotech company was just two years old but growing fast. In the early years Hoge said “we felt like we had to grow—and expand complexity—10-fold every year. Then during the pandemic it felt like it was every month another 10-fold.”

He was promoted to president in 2015 and Moderna’s hyper-growth forced him to quickly come to terms with what it means to be a good leader.

“Leadership is about surrounding yourself with really great people and putting them in places to succeed” he said. “If you can do that usually you end up looking good.”

Hoge says his core responsibility as a leader is to put people in positions where they can succeed as opposed to leaving them in roles that might have changed as the company grew. He saw the importance of bringing in additional support so workloads were more manageable in an effort to rebalance and continue innovating during the height of Moderna’s pandemic growth.

The company grew nearly 330% from 700 to about 3000 people over the course of the pandemic. It wasn’t always easy Hoge admits.

“Growth is really hard but we were trying to save the world—it turns out that’s a good recruitment tool. People get fired up about that” he said. “But it was still a tight labor market.”

Despite all the crazy hiring Hoge says they’ve remained 10% to 15% below their recruitment targets. To alleviate the issue he says his team has “thrown a tremendous amount of resources” into hiring training and retention including building a training site “Moderna University” for new-hire onboarding and a pharmaceutical industry crash course for newcomers.

The key to thoughtful efficiency Hoge says is empowering your workforce to go out and achieve the company’s goals. There was no time to micromanage the huge problems Moderna was trying to solve. Hoge didn’t care if it took a sledgehammer—he wanted to provide his team with the tools they needed.

“The key is communication” he said. “People need to understand the risks you’re taking why you’re taking them how you’re going to recover if something goes wrong. Lots of things did but we kept moving forward.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

TAP,Molson Coors Beverage Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9idXNpbmVzcy1mb29kL3N1bW1lci1hbGNvaG9sLXRyZW5kcy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9idXNpbmVzcy1mb29kL3N1bW1lci1hbGNvaG9sLXRyZW5kcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canned cocktails and bolder seltzers are set to dominate summer,"New York CNN Business —

When you crack open a cold one this summer you may be drinking something other than beer.

Drinkers will be tempted with a wide variety of new boozy beverages hitting shelves with big brands expanding their portfolios to offset slowing beer sales. Canned cocktails and spiked seltzers with upgraded flavors (sorry boring old lime!) are growing in popularity as Americans celebrate the warmer weather.

“This summer is going to be a reset” Jamie Wideman vice president of innovation for Molson Coors told CNN Business. “Last year people had one foot outside and one foot inside. I think the opportunity to explore and discover new beverages is going to be a big thing this summer.”

To that end the company is excited for the highly anticipated nationwide launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade on June 6. The alcoholic drink inspired by the Simply brand’s fruit juices is a collaboration between Molson Coors and Coca-Cola (KO). Flavors include strawberry lemonade watermelon lemonade blueberry lemonade and traditional lemonade.

“Consumers are already using the non-alcoholic Simply brand as part of their mixology regiment” Wideman said. “So bringing that into the ready-to-drink space was a no-brainer.”

Simply Spiked Lemonade is indicative of an overall trend blurring the lines between non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks with companies looking to bank on known brands and stretch their revenue. For example Boston Beer Company (SAM) recently partnered with PepsiCo to turn Mountain Dew into a caffeine-free alcoholic beverage and Molson Coors (TAP) is having success with its spiked Topo Chico lineup.

Even hard liquor companies are moving into the canned cocktail space. In recent months Cazadores Tequila rolled out canned margaritas and Jack Daniels introduced flavored whiskeys including apple cola and lemonade varieties.

Ready-to-drink cocktail sales have exploded as drinkers look for convenience and new flavors beyond wine and beer. That beverage category grew 53% last year and is projected to grow another 29% over the next three years according to data from IWSR Drinks Analysis.

Spiked seltzers remain popular too despite warning signs that the once-novel drink is losing market share. The category has grown nearly 4% in the past year falling well short of the gains seen with canned cocktails. The market is now saturated with more than 300 brands on shelves.

Sales of White Claw have slipped. Sftm/Gado/Getty Images

That has prompted companies to go back to the drawing board and unveil punchier flavors. White Claw which remains the top-selling seltzer brand has experienced a sales decline of 7% in the past year according to IRI a Chicago-based market research firm. It has recently rolled out bolder versions including White Claw Surf that uses exotic flavors (i.e. citrus yuzu smash) and an iced tea and lemonade pack called REFRSHR.

“As the category leader and originator White Claw understands the need for fresh innovation to maintain our status as the number one hard seltzer brand where last year we contributed over $2 billion to the category” John Shea White Claw’s chief marketing officer told CNN Business.

Truly Hard Seltzer remains the second-biggest brand with sales growing 13% year over year. The Boston Beer-owned brand has added a new Poolside variety pack with flavors like pina colada and strawberry melon fizz. It has even expanded into selling vodka.

Anheuser-Busch (BUD) also remains confident with its ever expanding Bud Light Seltzer lineup that now includes roughly two dozen flavors. “There is growth here and this is now coming from the rise of bolder flavors capturing consumer interest in products like Bud Light Seltzer Hard Soda” said Simon Wuestenberg the company’s chief sales officer. Anheuser-Busch (BUD) bolstered its lineup with cocktail-inspired seltzers and sour-flavored options.

However with more varieties to choose from Wideman warned that drinkers have the benefit of being picky.

“People are going to be less tolerant for things that don’t taste good” she said. “We know what’s happening in the world and in the economy. Dollars are important to them and they want to put their dollars in purchasing products that they know are going to deliver on their expectations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy91c2wtdG8tc2VsbC1vdmVyLTMwLWJyYW5kcy10by1pbmJyZXctYmV2ZXJhZ2VzLWZvci1ycy04MjAtY3ItMTE2NTM3MTE4NTQ4MjguaHRtbNIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy91c2wtdG8tc2VsbC1vdmVyLTMwLWJyYW5kcy10by1pbmJyZXctYmV2ZXJhZ2VzLWZvci1ycy04MjAtY3IvYW1wLTExNjUzNzExODU0ODI4Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USL to sell over 30 brands to Inbrew Beverages for ₹820 cr | Mint,"NEW DELHI : Liquor major United Spirits Limited (USL) on Friday announced the sale and franchising of over 30 popular brands to Inbrew Beverages for an estimated ₹820 crore the company said in a statement.

Investors in the ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund and Nikko AM SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF may potentially benefit from indirectly owning bonds denominated in the Singapore dollar given the local dollar’s tendency to appreciate against other regional currencies over time.

Over the past 10 years the Singapore dollar has strengthened by as much as 4 per cent per annum against regional currencies such as the Indonesian rupiah Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht10.

Looking ahead the Singapore dollar is likely to strengthen further following the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s recent decision to rein in inflation by increasing the local dollar’s rate of appreciation against a basket of other currencies11.

Bonds are an essential part of all investment portfolios since they provide greater certainty of income in the form of regular interest payments. Credit risks are also lower since bond issuers are legally required to repay the debt upon maturity.

As the world enters a new era of higher inflation and increased geopolitical uncertainties investors may want to focus more on managing risk and shift towards more balanced portfolios that include investment-grade bonds.

The most important thing to understand about Elon Musk’s public dickering over whether he will buy Twitter at $54.20 a share is that Elon has already signed a merger agreement committing him to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share. It’s a legally binding agreement and the Twitter board has said it intends to enforce it—M&A code for don’t mess with the deal unless you want a legal fight. Elon has a few ways to renege of course but not many. He can find “something” during his due diligence of Twitter that constitutes a reason for him to abandon the deal. But I don’t see what that could be and it’s certainly not an abundance of “bots.” Obviously if he can’t come up with the money he has committed to the $44 billion deal then he would have an out and then he could presumably pay his $1 billion break-up fee and walk away.

But from all appearances Elon is indeed still working hard to get his financing in order. Earlier this week he revised his plan in a regulatory filing eliminating his $6.5 billion of margin loans (secured by Tesla stock down from what was once a $12.5 billion margin loan) and thus raising his equity commitment to an astounding $33.5 billion. That should be a relief for Tesla shareholders who would have been exposed to a potential share price death spiral were Elon called upon by his bankers to unload his Tesla stock. The big question now is whether he can actually raise that much equity. If he can then Elon will own Twitter. If he can’t or decides he doesn’t want to he won’t own Twitter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudGVydGFpbm1lbnRkYWlseS5jb20vbmV3cy9waWVycy1tb3JnYW4tc29uLXN0YW5sZXktYWN0aW5nLWRlYnV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Piers Morgan reveals his pride as 'second son' Stanley makes acting debut,"Piers Morgan has hailed the beginnings of a performing career for ‘son number two’ on his Instagram and Twitter accounts.

Dad-of-four Piers congratulated his lad Stanley after watching him make his professional stage debut in north London.

What did Piers Morgan say about his son?

Attempting to turn theatre critic Piers bigged up Stanley’s performance to his social media fans.

The former GMB host also shared images showing him with his arm around his son as well a pic showing Stanley on stage that Piers might have taken from his theatre seat.

Piers wrote alongside the photos: “Congrats Stanley and the cast of The Breach on a fantastic run at Hampstead Theatre.

“Such a fascinating dark complex and challenging play which critics either loved or hated (always the mark of a good play!) but they all agreed the acting was superb.

“This was No2 son’s first big professional theatre role since leaving drama school and forgive my paternal pride when I say he absolutely killed it as did all the hugely talented young actors.”

Many of Piers’ followers were pleased to find out he has a budding thespian talent in the family with several offering their own congratulations.

Among them on Instagram was EastEnders star Jake Wood who commented: “Congrats Stanley enjoy!”

Someone else gushed: “Proud Dad! Well done Stanley and good luck for your future roles xx.”

Well done Stanley.

And a third contributed: “You have every right to be proud Piers. Well done Stanley.”

The work-from-home reality has reoriented people around their homes (necessitating home offices home gyms) and spurred homeowners to reassess design choices — often made by a faceless developer or previous owner. A shower wall or kitchen backsplash takes on more import when you’re looking at it all day every day. And the mosaic — an ancient art form popularized during the Roman Empire — is experiencing something of a renaissance amid the pandemic-spurred home design boom.

More from WWD

Before the great isolation says Cean Irminger a mosaicist and the creative director of Virginia-based mosaic company New Ravenna resale potential was top-of-mind when customers chose mosaic tile.

“People went for beiges and neutrals. They didn’t want anything with too much personality because they’re thinking I’m going to sell this house in a couple of years I should do something that will appeal to the masses and just be happy with that.”

Not anymore.

“Everybody’s realizing they’re going to be in their homes 365 days a year. They want it to be something that brings them joy” she adds. “They are no longer designing for a future unknown person.”

Even before the pandemic the minimalist aesthetic of the 2000s — which churned out so many white marble kitchens — was beginning to give way to color and creativity. “The whole 2000s it was white and gray white and gray maybe a little beige. But now it’s color it’s warm tones it’s things that catch the eye and have a lot of personality” says Irminger. “People aren’t scared of color anymore.”

New Ravenna stocks more than 1000 made-to-measure stone and glass mosaics. The recently released Biome collection includes patterns inspired by nature such as Gingko Reptile Sea Foam Sassafras and Geode. Each pattern is available in multiple colorways. All are hand-cut stone; a blue Geode ($715 a square foot) is made with honed Thassos polished Indigo Orchid Cornflower Hydrangea Aloe Lotus Periwinkle Celeste Carrara Blue Macauba and Aurum.

“We consider Geode like a painting” explains Irminger. “It does not have a pattern that repeats. Every time somebody orders the Geode we’re going to give them their own one-of-a-kind piece of art to fit their space.”

If the pandemic has inspired a reassessment of our interior spaces for Irminger more time at home also has animated her professional life. When the world went into lockdown in spring 2020 she found herself thrust into the role of teacher and playmate to her young daughters then 7 and 9. Luckily they live on a 100-acre farm in Exmore a tiny agrarian community on Virginia’s Eastern Shore peninsula where New Ravenna is headquartered. The outdoors became their classroom; there were “science walks” in the woods and plenty of space for messy crafts like tie-dye. Those experiences became the inspiration for Irminger’s newest collection of mosaics called Heyday. To Dye For evokes the burst of color and pattern of a tie-dyed shirt. There’s also Fire Fly and Phase to Phase a geometric mosaic that mimics the phases of the moon.

Says Irminger: “For me it was just a matter of how to translate that inspiration in a way that might be a little more sophisticated and less on the nose; to create something that can still enliven somebody’s living space with a jolt of childhood joy.”

New Ravenna ships about 16000 square feet of mosaics each month and has seen sales of its made-to-measure mosaics spike 20 percent compared to the past three years. (Made-to-measure mosaics represent 70 percent of orders; New Ravenna also has a ready-to-ship line.) Irminger is among five in-house designers while New Ravenna also regularly partners with guest designers including NewYork City-based interior designer Sasha Bikoff and architect and designer Caroline Beaupère whose association with New Ravenna began several years ago when she worked with the company to create bespoke glass mosaics for her clients including a meandering cherry blossom vine in the master bath of a Jersey City residence and a bird-and-vine motif for a kitchen backsplash in a small Kips Bay apartment.

“That is the silver lining of the pandemic — people are spending a lot of time in their homes and they want their homes to really reflect them instead of simply living in a space and then maybe one day selling it” says Beaupère who is working on her second collection for New Ravenna.

Beaupère prefers to design with glass for its infinite color possibilities from subtle pastels to the vivid jewel tones that have become more popular and that are not always achievable with natural stone. (Basalto a common volcanic rock can be glazed to achieve bright tones.)

Unlike wallpaper or paint or a piece of mass-produced furniture mosaics are customizable and durable.

“That’s something that clients love” says Beaupère. “A mosaic can bring life and energy into a space it’s unique and something that no one else in the world has.”

New Ravenna has seen a pandemic-era spike in bespoke customization requests; from incorporating family names into a floor medallion to incorporating a customer’s local flora and fauna into one of the company’s Chinoiserie-esque patterns. Bird motifs are particularly popular at the moment and costumers are requesting very bold color changes to existing patterns.

But off-the-wall requests are also not uncommon. Irminger has designed several quirky bespoke mosaics including a 5-foot-tall rabbit for the bottom of a pool a portrait of a cat shaved to look like a lion and a silhouette portrait of a man and woman wearing nothing but cowboy hats. “It’s the greatest outdoor shower installation of all time” she says.

And truly one-of-a-kind.

What does Mondu do?

Mondu is part of a new wave of B2B buy now pay later (BNPL) fintechs that provide loans to businesses rather than consumers — and is proving red hot among VCs even in the current climate. Just last week there were two other funding announcements from fintechs in the sector — Tranch and Previse.

B2B BNPL is designed as a short-term financing tool to help companies manage their cash flow. Mondu has built a payments product that gives online SME merchants and marketplaces flexible payment options at checkout.

Who's investing in Mondu?

US-based Valar Ventures PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel’s VC firm led the round

Existing VCs Cherry Ventures and FinTech Collective also participated…

... along with angels from leadership at Klarna Zalando and SumUp

What's the B2B BNPL market like?



There are nine B2B BNPLs in Europe right now including new entrants Tranch and Previse

Billie also based in Berlin is the most well-funded player valued at $640m after raising a $100m Series C last October. B2C BNPL king Klarna invested in that round and gave Billie a big boost by choosing it as its partner for the rollout of a B2B side to its business.

London-based Hokodo raised a $12.5m Mosaic Ventures-led Series A last summer to become the “Klarna for B2B” through many of the same methods as Billie and Mondu.

When Sifted asks cofounder and co-CEO Malte Huffmann how Mondu differs from Billie and will manage to capture market share he says the company believes B2B BNPL is “still a blue ocean opportunity” where there’s “enough space for multiple players to become very sizeable.” Mondu estimates that the B2B BNPL market will grow to $200bn in Europe and the US in the next few years.

What’s next for the company?

Mondu plans to expand into more European countries later this year beginning with Austria this summer.

Huffmann says that Mondu will be hiring “aggressively” going forward but wouldn’t put a number on it. Its current team stands at 100. The company is remote-first but its team will mainly be located in Germany.

Sifted’s take

Don’t expect investor interest in B2B BNPL tail off anytime soon — but startups in the space will need to start differentiating to really stand out. Can Mondu demonstrate that it has something Billie doesn’t?

However the stock has fallen more than 30% over the past six months.

The company's growth strategy has heavily leaned on its balance sheet leaving the business with a high debt load as we possibly head for a recession.

Investors shouldn't panic but there are legitimate reasons for some concern. Here is what you need to know and how it could impact the stock.

Domino's gushes free cash flow

Domino's Pizza has enjoyed a decade of strong growth; the company grew its store count from 10255 at the end of 2012 to 18848 at the end of 2021. Combine that with consistent same-store sales growth and the company as a whole has grown revenue by 10% annually on average over the past decade.

Domino's does numerous things to compete in a very fragmented industry. Customers can place their orders through a smartphone app making ordering a convenient experience. It uses a franchise model for its stores so the company isn't responsible for most of the day-to-day expenses of running the stores.

Its nearly 19000 stores also give the company economies of scale. Its larger size gives it buying power on raw ingredients and more efficient logistics. Local mom-and-pop pizzerias often struggle to compete on price because they don't have these advantages.

These factors have made Domino's increasingly good at generating free cash flow. You can see how the company once turned between $0.06 and $0.08 of every revenue dollar into cash flow but that has risen to nearly $0.13.

But does it have a spending problem?

Earnings-per-share (EPS) has grown an average of 22% annually over the past decade helping explain the stock's massive success. Profits will double in just over three years at that rate meaning the share price doubles if the stock's price-to-earnings ratio remains the same.

So how is Domino's growing profits so much faster than revenue? Share repurchases have played a significant role in that. The company buys its own stock which leaves fewer shares to spread profits across.

Management has used massive repurchase programs exceeding the company's total free cash flow multiple times over the past ten years. Domino's also pays a dividend which uses nearly 30% of its cash flow. In other words it's spending more money than it's making.

What impact could the balance sheet have on the stock?

You can see the evidence of this below in the balance sheet. Domino's is taking on increasingly higher debt over time now up to $5 billion against just $165 million in cash. Its debt is more than five times the company's EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes deprecation amortization) a higher ratio than I would feel comfortable with.

This is unsustainable and with interest rates rising amid a potential recession Domino's will likely get a lot more conservative moving forward. It's one thing when zero-percent rates make debt cheap but borrowing is harder when rates go up.

Management will probably need to dramatically scale back its share repurchases which will cause the company's EPS growth to slow down to something much closer to its revenue growth of 10% which is less than half of Domino's 10-year EPS growth rate).

The market could look at slowing profit growth and decide that the stock deserves a lower valuation and this ""chain reaction"" could explain why the stock has stumbled over the past six months.

Shares currently trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27 a discount to its 10-year median P/E of 32. However with a loaded balance sheet that could take years to pay down the stock could remain below its past valuation and investors should consider that before rushing to buy shares.

Created in 2020 it is an Etherum-based alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE) the meme coin made popular by Elon Musk.

After its launch the SHIB coin ranked as one of the biggest crypto in the world in October 2021. Shib appreciated close to a whopping 49000000% in 2021. If you had bought just $2.05 worth of SHIB on January 1 2022 by the end of the year you would have been a millionaire!

Shiba Inu has like most cryptocurrencies taken a beating this year but it is still up over 16000000% since the beginning of 2021. While mining Bitcoin now requires large warehouses of powerful mining machines you can still use the processing power of your personal computer's CPU or GPU to generate smaller cryptos like Shiba Inu.

Get a cryptocurrency wallet address

The first step is to set up a crypto wallet. Crypto wallets don't actually store crypto. They keep your private key -- password that gives you access to your crypto -- safe and accessible. The crypto you own is on the blockchain and your key is proof that you own your crypto and allow you to make transactions.

It is important you don't lose your wallet or else you lose complete access to your crypto. Your wallet can be a USB stick or software programs such as Coinbase or Crypto.com. To start mining SHIB you will need a crypto wallet to collect your rewards once you have reached the payout threshold.

Crypto mining on your computer

unMineable is a well-known crypto mining software program. It has an easy-to-understand user interface for beginner miners. The program lets you mine certain coins not typically mineable with GPUs such as Shiba Inu Aave Cardano Digibyte Dogecoin etc.

You can download the program to your PC and it is free to use. Currently there is no iOS version. It has a standard mining fee between 0.75% to 1% and your computer will need to be on in order for the program to run. Once you download the program it will detect your computer's hardware.

You then choose the coin you want to mine and input your wallet address. A window pops up showing your balance the crypto you are mining and your current hashrate. How much your computer will mine your current hashrate depends on your GPU.

Is it worth it?

After learning about this I downloaded the program onto my current laptop to test it out. I had to disable my antivirus program on my computer to download and run unMineable. I found that the website was a little difficult to understand so I watched some youtube videos to help me complete the setup.

My laptop can mine at 45 megahashes per second (MH/s). Hash rates essentially measure the computing power to mine crypto and measure the number of calculations per second which can be as high as the quintillions. In comparison the best Bitcoin miner has a hashrate of 10 terahashes per second (TH/s) which is about 200000 times more powerful than my laptop. I tested the program on my older laptop and could only mine about 400 kilohashes per second (kH/s).

Based on current rates I can mine about 39800 Shiba Inu a day or 1.2 million a month. My laptop would need to be running 24/7. This comes out to $0.48 a day or $14 a month. When Shiba Inu was at its height in October 2021 this would have been about 7 times more or $100 a month. If you take into account my power consumption of 105 watts the cost per KWh at $0.25 and the 1% pool fee the profit drops to $0.43 per month or $5.27 per year.

It doesn't seem like much given the wear and tear of my laptop and the amount of electricity I am using. However if you live in an area where electricity is cheaper and believe that SHIB will continue to grow in popularity then it may be worth it. For now unMineable seems to be safe to mine crypto but it is important to be aware of the market. Utility prices have been rising due to global events and cryptocurrencies across the board have dropped in value. Crypto is still quite volatile and the value of your returns are far less unpredictable especially with smaller coins such as SHIB.

Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY) is one of the largest gaming companies in the world and I think it fits all three of these criteria. Here's what the business could look like five years from now in 2027.

1. A successful -- or not -- next-generation gaming device

The key to Nintendo's success in video games has been its combination of unique hardware devices and fantastic in-house games from franchises like Mario Zelda and Animal Crossing. Its most recent hardware device launched in 2017 is the Nintendo Switch. The Switch is a hybrid mobile/console system and has essentially been the leader in unit sales since its release.

According to Nintendo's Investor Relations page the company has sold around 108 million Switch units around the world. This huge installed base leads to tons of software/game sales which drives the majority of Nintendo's profit. For example Nintendo did 235 million in software unit sales last fiscal year translating to $4.67 billion in operating profit.

But the big question is when Nintendo will release its next-generation device. The Switch is almost six years old now and needs a true upgrade with better graphics and processing power. Investors should look for this new device to be announced in the next year or two given Nintendo's historical device upgrade cycle.

A successful new hardware device is imperative for Nintendo's business because it is the engine that keeps people buying games. If Nintendo can build on the original Switch's success and continue selling hundreds of millions of games a year its business will likely be in great shape in 2027. If not we could be headed for some dark days like those experienced with the disappointing Wii U console which tanked Nintendo's stock price in the 2012-to-2014 period.

2. More robust subscription services

To get more consistent earnings Nintendo has recently built an online subscription service similar to Xbox and Playstation. Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) can play games like Mario Kart with their friends or other people online while also getting access to some legacy games from old Nintendo devices. The standard service costs $20 a year for individuals and $35 a year for families so it is very accessible for gamers to buy.

On top of the flagship service Nintendo released the NSO + Expansion Pack last fall which costs $50 a year for individuals and $80 a year for families. With the upgraded service players get access to Nintendo 64 games downloadable packs for popular franchises and access to SEGA Genesis games. It is too early to tell but hopefully this service can drive more revenue from subscription services with higher price points.

As of its latest update back in September Nintendo had 32 million subscribers across its various NSO tiers. Since then management hasn't given out a specific number but said NSO subscribers continue to grow especially by attaching downloadable packs for popular franchises like Mario Kart and Animal Crossing. By 2027 investors should expect Nintendo to have built out more robust subscription services. This means more legacy games better connectivity for online play and more downloadable packs within the Expansion Pack.

If Nintendo can get to 50 million global NSO subscribers who pay on average $30 a year (which seems very conservative given how many subscribers it already has) that will equate to $1.5 billion in annual subscription revenue. Likely with high-profit margins NSO can be very lucrative for Nintendo if it continues to grow over the next five years.

3. Expansion into non-gaming entertainment

The biggest change-up with Nintendo from now until 2027 will be moving outside of just being a gaming company. With its hugely successful franchises the company has decided to become more Disney-like expanding into theme parks and video entertainment.

Four Super Nintendo Worlds are set to open around the world within the next five years built by Universal Studios in a licensing agreement with Nintendo. One is already open in Japan and has gotten rave reviews highlighting how much families and kids love Nintendo characters. These parks will not only generate licensing revenue for Nintendo but also help strengthen the relationship it has with its fanbases.

Nintendo has also partnered with Illumination Studios to make an animated Super Mario movie coming in the spring of 2023. We don't know what other content is planned for the future (Nintendo is very secretive) but if this movie is successful you can bet more will be released over the next five years.

By 2027 Nintendo should have multiple theme parks open around the world along with a growing library of movies. Combined with its subscription services and the eventual new hardware device the company could double its annual operating profit to $9 billion by 2027. At a current enterprise value of only $36.8 billion the stock looks rather cheap for anyone focused on the long term.

(NASDAQ:ROAD) insiders who had purchased shares in the previous 12 months were rewarded handsomely. The shares increased by 7.8% last week resulting in a US$89m increase in the company's market worth. As a result the stock they originally bought for US$628k is now worth US$704k.

While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.

Construction Partners Insider Transactions Over The Last Year

Over the last year we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Senior Vice President John Harper for US$628k worth of shares at about US$21.05 per share. Although we like to see insider buying we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$23.45. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.

You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months below. If you click on the chart you can see all the individual transactions including the share price individual and the date!

There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.

Insider Ownership of Construction Partners

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually the higher the insider ownership the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Construction Partners insiders own about US$135m worth of shares (which is 11% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

What Might The Insider Transactions At Construction Partners Tell Us?

It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. Once you factor in the high insider ownership it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Construction Partners. One for the watchlist at least! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To help with this we've discovered 2 warning signs (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Construction Partners.

The media and entertainment industry prides itself on its mastery of classical storytelling's three acts: the setup the conflict and the resolution. It's safe to declare the first act of the streaming video wars over. Barring a surprise late entrant every major media and technology company that wants to be in the streaming game has planted a flag. Disney+ Apple TV+ Paramount+ Peacock and other new streaming services are spreading around the globe. ""Act one was the land grab phase"" said Chris Marangi a media investor and portfolio manager at Gamco Investors. ""Now we're in the middle act."" Last month the central conflict of the streaming wars came into focus. The industry was thrust into turmoil after Netflix disclosed its first quarterly drop in subscribers in more than a decade and warned subscriber losses would continue in the near term.

Second act problems Netflix's rapid decline after a pandemic-fueled boom has investors questioning the value of investing in media companies.

Streaming is the future of the business regardless of recent problems as consumers have gotten used to the flexibility the services offer.

There could be more consolidation to come and streamers are increasingly embracing cheaper ad-supported tiers.

That news set off worries about streaming's future and cast doubt on whether the growing number of platforms could become profitable. At stake are the valuations of the world's largest media and entertainment companies — Disney  Comcast  Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery — and the tens of billions of dollars being spent each year on new original streaming content. As recently as October Netflix whose hit series ""Stranger Things"" returned Friday had a market capitalization more than $300 billion topping Disney's at $290 billion. But its shares are down over 67% from the start of the year slashing the company's worth to around $86 billion. Legacy media companies that followed Netflix's lead and pivoted to streaming video have suffered too. Disney shares are among the worst performing stocks on the Dow Jones industrials this year down about 30%. That's even though series such as ""The Book of Boba Fett"" and ""Moon Knight"" helped Disney+ add 20 million subscribers in the past two quarters. The highly anticipated ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" premiered on Friday. Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO and HBO Max services also added 12.8 million subscribers over the past year bringing total subscribers to 76.8 million globally. But shares are down more than 20% since the company's stock began trading in April following the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery. Nobody knows whether streaming's final act will reveal a path to profitability or which players might emerge dominant. Not that long ago the formula for streaming success seemed straightforward: Add subscribers see stock prices climb. But Netflix's shocking freefall has forced executives to rethink their next moves. ""The pandemic created a boom with all these new subscribers efficiently stuck at home and now a bust"" said Michael Nathanson a MoffettNathanson media analyst. ""Now all these companies need to make a decision. Do you keep chasing Netflix around the globe or do you stop the fight?""

Stick with streaming

Traditional TV also lacks the flexibility of streaming which many viewers have come to prefer. Digital viewing allows for mobile watching on multiple devices at any time. A la carte pricing gives consumers more choices compared with having to spend nearly $100 a month on a bundle of cable networks most of which they don't watch.

More deals

Consolidation is another prospect given the growing number of players vying for viewers. As it stands Amazon Prime Video Apple TV+ Disney+ HBO Max/Discovery+ Netflix Paramount+ and Peacock all have global ambitions as profitable streaming services. Media executives largely agree that some of those services will need to combine quibbling only about how many will survive. One major acquisition could alter how investors view the industry's potential said Gamco's Marangi. ""Hopefully the final act is growth again"" he said. ""The reason to stay invested is you don't know when act three will begin."" U.S. regulators may make any deal among the largest streamers difficult. Amazon bought MGM the studio behind the James Bond franchise for $8.5 billion but it's unclear whether it would want to buy anything much larger. Government restrictions around broadcast station ownership would almost certainly doom a deal that put say NBC and CBS together. That likely eliminates a straight merger between parent companies NBCUniversal and Paramount Global without divesting one of the two broadcast networks and its owned affiliates in a separate messier transaction. But if streaming continues to take over as the dominant form of viewership it's possible regulators will eventually soften to the idea that broadcast network ownership is anachronistic. New presidential administrations may be open to deals current regulators may try to deny.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said this month it bought 69 million shares of Paramount Global — a sign Buffett and his colleagues either believe the company's business prospects will improve or the company will get acquired with an M&A premium to boost shares.

Advertising hopes

Evan Spiegel CEO of SNAP Inc. Stephen Desaulniers | CNBC

""Advertising is an inherently volatile business"" said Patrick Steel former CEO of Politico the political digital media company. ""The slowdown which started in the fall has accelerated in the last few months. We are now in a down cycle."" Offering cheaper ad-supported subscription won't matter unless Netflix and Disney give consumers a reason to sign up with consistently good shows said Bill Smead chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management whose funds own shares of Warner Bros. Discovery. The shift in the second act of the streaming wars could see investors rewarding the best content rather than the most powerful model of distribution. Netflix co-founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings told the New York Times his company ""is continuing to have some of the most popular shows in America and around the world."" But it remains to be seen if Netflix can compete with legacy media's established content engines and intellectual property when the market isn't rewarding ever-ballooning budgets. ""Netflix broke the moat of traditional pay TV which was a very good profitable business and investors followed"" said Smead. ""But Netflix may have underestimated how hard it is to consistently come up with great content especially when capital markets stop supporting you and the Fed stops giving away free money.""

Try something else

The major problem with staying the course is it's not an exciting new opportunity for investors who have soured on the streaming wars. ""The days of getting a tech multiple on these companies are probably over"" said Andrew Walker a portfolio manager at Rangeley Capital whose fund also owns Warner Bros. Discovery. ""But maybe you don't need a tech multiple to do well at these prices? That's what we're all trying to figure out right now."" Offering a new storyline is one way to change the stale investment narrative. Media analyst Rich Greenfield advocates Disney acquire Roblox a gaming company based on digital multiplayer interactive worlds to show investors it's leaning into creating experiential entertainment. ""I just keep thinking about Bob Iger"" Greenfield said of the former Disney CEO who departed the company in December. ""When he came in he made his mark by buying Pixar. That transformative transaction was doing something big and bold early on.""

Given the extreme pullback on Roblox shares Greenfield noted Disney CEO Bob Chapek has an opportunity to make a transformative deal that could alter the way investors view his company. Roblox's enterprise value is about $18 billion down from about $60 billion at the start of the year. But media companies have historically shied away from gaming and other out-of-the-box acquisitions. Under Iger Disney shut down its game development division in 2016. Acquisitions can help companies diversify and help them plant a flag in another industry but they can also lead to mismanagement culture clash and poor decision making (see: AOL-Time Warner AT&T-DirecTV AT&T-Time Warner). Comcast recently rejected a deal to merge NBCUniversal with video game company EA according to a person familiar with the matter. Puck was first to report the discussions. Yet big media companies are no longer compelling products on their own said Eric Jackson founder and president of EMJ Capital who focuses on media and technology investing. Apple and Amazon have developed streaming services to bolster their services offerings around their primary businesses. Apple TV+ is compelling as an added reason for consumers to buy Apple phones and tablets Jackson said but it's not special as an individual stand-alone service. Amazon Prime Video amounts to a benefit making a Prime subscription more compelling though the primary reason to subscribe to Prime continues to be free shipping for Amazon's enormous e-commerce business. There's no obvious reason the business will suddenly be valued differently Jackson said. The era of the stand-alone pure-play media company may be over he said. ""Media/streaming is now the parsley on the meal — not the meal"" he said. Disclosure: CNBC is part of NBCUniversal which is owned by Comcast.

In a famous satirical poem left-wing author Bertolt Brecht said that if so perhaps the government could dissolve the people and elect a new lot.

One guesses that after the recent Australian election News Corp would also like to elect a new public as the result highlighted its own irrelevance and how out of touch it is with the Australian mainstream. Rather than directly attacking the public though it aimed its vitriol at the Greens and the teal independents both of whom had wildly successful elections and against Labor which regained government from opposition.

So far the media company’s epic fail seems not to have occasioned any soul- searching. Indeed some in its stable – in a triumph of ideological fantasy over numeracy – have asserted the result was due to the Liberals moving too far “left”.

Questions remain about the future though: will the election lead News Corp to change either out of professional shame or in the interests of expanding its market share beyond the right-wing populist ghetto it inhabits? And how will it treat the incoming government?

Some insight might be gained from how the jewel in Murdoch’s crown his greatest commercial and political success of the past three decades Fox News covered the administrations of US presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden both of whose elections it had vehemently opposed.

The opposition to Obama from Fox’s commentators was immediate and unrelenting. Even before he took office after an economic setback during the global recession which had been going on for months Fox News star Sean Hannity said Obama was to blame because the prospect of his taking over had made wealthy people get out of the market.

On the day of the president’s inauguration Rush Limbaugh declared: “I hope he fails”. On day three Laura Ingraham declared “our country is less safe today”. The next day their new star Glenn Beck said Obama had ended the war on terror and a week later asserted the country was on a march towards socialism.

Over the next few years Fox gave oxygen to the “birther” issue. This was the claim that Obama was not born in America and so was not eligible to be president – that his birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii was fake. In two months in early 2011 Fox devoted 52 items to “birther” stories 44 of which featured the claim without any other view being put.

Julie Jacobson/AP/AAP

Fox also took decisive steps transgressing what others would consider professional boundaries in becoming directly involved in the formation of the Tea Party a right-wing movement that proclaimed it wanted to take their country back who demanded ever more right-wing candidates in the Republican Party. Not only did Fox give abundant publicity to their rallies its then most prominent star Glenn Beck spoke at numerous rallies.

This points to an interesting paradox: Fox News probably persuades few Democrats to change sides. Rather the biggest losers from Fox’s impact have been moderate Republicans as Fox has helped move the party ever more to the right.

Could it be that News Corp is having or will have a similar impact on the conservative side of Australian politics making it harder for the Liberals to develop sane policies on issues such as global warming?

After Biden’s election several Fox presenters supported Trump’s claims that the election was stolen that Trump had really won. This strikes at one of the fundamental pillars of democracy: that the vote count can be trusted.

More recently Fox has promoted an equally dangerous idea especially promoted by its highest-paid performer Tucker Carlson. This is known as the Great Replacement Theory. A long-term demographic trend in the US is that the proportion of whites is gradually declining as those of Blacks Latinos and other ethnic groups grow more quickly.

Carlson and others turn this into a conspiracy theory: that Democratic elites are seeking to force demographic change through immigration to replace the current electorate with new more “obedient” people from the Third World.

Carlson has made more than 400 references to this absurd conspiracy. In the past year these dangerous views have moved from the fringes with substantial proportions of Republicans agreeing with some aspects of the theory.

Read more: As News Corp goes 'rogue' on election coverage what price will Australian democracy pay?

It is impossible to imagine a more moderate or centrist Fox News. Its business model is built on delivering a predictable product to its niche audience of alienated older whites mobilising their resentments over status anxiety cutting through the complexities of the modern world with simple affirmations of their prejudices.

Its most successful shows rarely attract more than 2-3% of the viewing public itself a shrinking percentage of the total population. But its mix of strong opinions and minimal expenditure on reporting has been wildly profitable.

There was a time when Rupert Murdoch had a shrewd populist touch and for reasons of both patronage and reputation aimed to be on the winning side in elections. Those days are gone. The past few decades have seen the “Foxification” of News Corp.

This does not mean we will see claims of electoral fraud or replacement theories in Australia. But it does mean that the company’s formula for commercial viability is giving a predictable product to a niche audience.

In turn this means that Murdoch’s outlets are now rusted-on supporters of right-wing parties and views indifferent to any electoral counter-currents. Many of his most prominent commentators have the consistency of a stopped clock.

The bankers from Goldman Sachs and LionTree came with many deal ideas according to four people with knowledge of the meeting. The most logical one the bankers said was combining some parts of Paramount — which owns networks like Nickelodeon and MTV and the Paramount+ streaming service — with those owned by Comcast the cable giant that owns NBCUniversal and the Peacock streaming service. The two companies already have a streaming joint venture in Europe.

But in the end the board Ms. Redstone and Bob Bakish the company’s chief executive did not feel compelled to pursue any of the combinations. They would continue to zig while Hollywood zagged.

The New Delhi bench of the NCLT has also appointed Amit Talwar as an interim resolution professional (IRP) suspending the board of NTC and has also declared a moratorium against the PSU as per the provisions of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

A two-member NCLT bench also rejected the claims of NTC and said the dispute it raised over the due amount claimed by its operational creditor is merely a ""moonshine dispute and said default has occurred for the payment.

This is probably for the first time since the code has come into effect that insolvency proceedings against a central government-owned public sector unit (PSU) has been initiated.

NTC is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Textile Government of India. It is engaged in the production of yarn and fabric through its 23 mills in operation located all over India.

The NCLT direction came over a petition filed by Hero Solar Energy Private Ltd (HSEPL) through its counsel Pallav Mongia claiming a default of Rs 13.84 lakh for two contracts for installing solar rooftop power projects.

The matter relates to an almost six-year-old contract. NTC had awarded a work order in May 2016 in Tamil Nadu for a total 780 kWp grid-connected rooftop solar power PV system.

As per the contract of both the projects the amount of Rs 2.21 crore towards Project 1 and Rs 1.86 crore towards Project 2 become due upon the completion of work on December 2016 and April 2017 respectively.

However NTC failed to release the complete payment due to HSEPL and retained an amount of Rs 13.84 lakh against the terms of the agreement.

It was informed by the operational creditor that as per the clauses of the agreement there was no provision for levying any penalty and sent a demand notice to NTC under section 8 of the IBC.

However NTC in its reply had said HSEPL has committed a delay of 117 days in the execution of the work order and it has suffered losses and hence it has deducted penalties from the amount due.

This was denied by HSEPL and said no notice of dispute was ever given by NTC to HSEPL and in fact in its several letters written to the PSU demanding the pending dues no dispute over delay in execution was raised.

The insolvency tribunal also agreed with the submissions of the operational creditor and said: ""Considering the documents on record admittedly the respondent has never raised any dispute over the quantum of claim or delay of the applicant. The corporate debtor has failed to place any document on record to show that said imposition of penalty was ever communicated to the applicant before issuance of demand notice.""



No debit note in this regard was ever issued by the respondent NCLT observed adding ""No penalty or liquidated damages were levied by corporate debtor"".

""Admittedly in terms of the agreement the corporate debtor is not entitled to impose any penalty to the applicant. The respondent even reconciled the accounts of the applicant and failed to raise any dispute over the claim of the applicant during reconciliation said NCLT in its 10-page long order passed on May 27.

The tribunal further said even the Indian Contract Act provided that in case of the promisor failed to perform the contract at the time agreed and the promise still accepts the performance of such promise any time other than agreed the promisee cannot claim compensation for any loss.

""It is not the case of the respondent (NTC) that work order was never completed by the applicant. The respondent has already made payments to the applicant which shows that there is no defect in the performance of contract  it said.

This leaves no doubt that the default has occurred for the payment of the operational debt to the applicant and the so-called dispute raised by NTC is merely a ""moonshine dispute.

""Therefore in the given facts and circumstances it can be concluded that the applicant has established its claim which is due and payable by the corporate debtor and the corporate debtor has failed to prove the existence of any pre-existing dispute in respect of amount claimed by the applicant. The present application is admitted said NCLT.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaWtleS5jb20uYXUvd2Vla2VuZGVyLzI4LTA1LTIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The web does not forget Babet,"There’s a veritable tsunami of election coverage out there so let us at Crikey highlight some of the best.

Questions remain about the future though: will the election lead News Corp to change either out of professional shame or in the interests of expanding its market share beyond the right-wing populist ghetto it inhabits? And how will it treat the incoming government?

Some insight might be gained from how the jewel in Murdoch’s crown his greatest commercial and political success of the past three decades Fox News covered the administrations of US presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden both of whose elections it had vehemently opposed.

The opposition to Obama from Fox’s commentators was immediate and unrelenting. Even before he took office after an economic setback during the global recession which had been going on for months Fox News star Sean Hannity said Obama was to blame because the prospect of his taking over had made wealthy people get out of the market.

On the day of the president’s inauguration Rush Limbaugh declared: “I hope he fails”. On day three Laura Ingraham declared “our country is less safe today”. The next day their new star Glenn Beck said Obama had ended the war on terror and a week later asserted the country was on a march towards socialism.

Over the next few years Fox gave oxygen to the “birther” issue. This was the claim that Obama was not born in America and so was not eligible to be president – that his birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii was fake. In two months in early 2011 Fox devoted 52 items to “birther” stories 44 of which featured the claim without any other view being put.

Fox also took decisive steps transgressing what others would consider professional boundaries in becoming directly involved in the formation of the Tea Party a right-wing movement that proclaimed it wanted to take their country back who demanded ever more right-wing candidates in the Republican Party. Not only did Fox give abundant publicity to their rallies its then most prominent star Glenn Beck spoke at numerous rallies.

This points to an interesting paradox: Fox News probably persuades few Democrats to change sides. Rather the biggest losers from Fox’s impact have been moderate Republicans as Fox has helped move the party ever more to the right.

Could it be that News Corp is having or will have a similar impact on the conservative side of Australian politics making it harder for the Liberals to develop sane policies on issues such as global warming?

After Biden’s election several Fox presenters supported Trump’s claims that the election was stolen that Trump had really won. This strikes at one of the fundamental pillars of democracy: that the vote count can be trusted.

More recently Fox has promoted an equally dangerous idea especially promoted by its highest-paid performer Tucker Carlson. This is known as the Great Replacement Theory. A long-term demographic trend in the US is that the proportion of whites is gradually declining as those of Blacks Latinos and other ethnic groups grow more quickly.

Carlson and others turn this into a conspiracy theory: that Democratic elites are seeking to force demographic change through immigration to replace the current electorate with new more “obedient” people from the Third World.

Carlson has made more than 400 references to this absurd conspiracy. In the past year these dangerous views have moved from the fringes with substantial proportions of Republicans agreeing with some aspects of the theory.

It is impossible to imagine a more moderate or centrist Fox News. Its business model is built on delivering a predictable product to its niche audience of alienated older whites mobilising their resentments over status anxiety cutting through the complexities of the modern world with simple affirmations of their prejudices.

Its most successful shows rarely attract more than 2-3% of the viewing public itself a shrinking percentage of the total population. But its mix of strong opinions and minimal expenditure on reporting has been wildly profitable.

There was a time when Rupert Murdoch had a shrewd populist touch and for reasons of both patronage and reputation aimed to be on the winning side in elections. Those days are gone. The past few decades have seen the “Foxification” of News Corp.

This does not mean we will see claims of electoral fraud or replacement theories in Australia. But it does mean that the company’s formula for commercial viability is giving a predictable product to a niche audience.

In turn this means that Murdoch’s outlets are now rusted-on supporters of right-wing parties and views indifferent to any electoral counter-currents. Many of his most prominent commentators have the consistency of a stopped clock.

The New Delhi bench of the NCLT has also appointed Amit Talwar as an interim resolution professional (IRP) suspending the board of NTC and has also declared a moratorium against the PSU as per the provisions of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

A two-member NCLT bench also rejected the claims of NTC and said the dispute it raised over the due amount claimed by its operational creditor is merely a ""moonshine dispute and said default has occurred for the payment.

This is probably for the first time since the code has come into effect that insolvency proceedings against a central government-owned public sector unit (PSU) has been initiated.

NTC is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Textile Government of India. It is engaged in the production of yarn and fabric through its 23 mills in operation located all over India.

The NCLT direction came over a petition filed by Hero Solar Energy Private Ltd (HSEPL) through its counsel Pallav Mongia claiming a default of Rs 13.84 lakh for two contracts for installing solar rooftop power projects.

The matter relates to an almost six-year-old contract. NTC had awarded a work order in May 2016 in Tamil Nadu for a total 780 kWp grid-connected rooftop solar power PV system.

As per the contract of both the projects the amount of Rs 2.21 crore towards Project 1 and Rs 1.86 crore towards Project 2 become due upon the completion of work on December 2016 and April 2017 respectively.

However NTC failed to release the complete payment due to HSEPL and retained an amount of Rs 13.84 lakh against the terms of the agreement.

It was informed by the operational creditor that as per the clauses of the agreement there was no provision for levying any penalty and sent a demand notice to NTC under section 8 of the IBC.

However NTC in its reply had said HSEPL has committed a delay of 117 days in the execution of the work order and it has suffered losses and hence it has deducted penalties from the amount due.

This was denied by HSEPL and said no notice of dispute was ever given by NTC to HSEPL and in fact in its several letters written to the PSU demanding the pending dues no dispute over delay in execution was raised.

The insolvency tribunal also agreed with the submissions of the operational creditor and said: ""Considering the documents on record admittedly the respondent has never raised any dispute over the quantum of claim or delay of the applicant. The corporate debtor has failed to place any document on record to show that said imposition of penalty was ever communicated to the applicant before issuance of demand notice.""



No debit note in this regard was ever issued by the respondent NCLT observed adding ""No penalty or liquidated damages were levied by corporate debtor"".

""Admittedly in terms of the agreement the corporate debtor is not entitled to impose any penalty to the applicant. The respondent even reconciled the accounts of the applicant and failed to raise any dispute over the claim of the applicant during reconciliation said NCLT in its 10-page long order passed on May 27.

The tribunal further said even the Indian Contract Act provided that in case of the promisor failed to perform the contract at the time agreed and the promise still accepts the performance of such promise any time other than agreed the promisee cannot claim compensation for any loss.

""It is not the case of the respondent (NTC) that work order was never completed by the applicant. The respondent has already made payments to the applicant which shows that there is no defect in the performance of contract  it said.

This leaves no doubt that the default has occurred for the payment of the operational debt to the applicant and the so-called dispute raised by NTC is merely a ""moonshine dispute.

""Therefore in the given facts and circumstances it can be concluded that the applicant has established its claim which is due and payable by the corporate debtor and the corporate debtor has failed to prove the existence of any pre-existing dispute in respect of amount claimed by the applicant. The present application is admitted said NCLT.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaWtleS5jb20uYXUvd2Vla2VuZGVyLzI4LTA1LTIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The web does not forget Babet,"There’s a veritable tsunami of election coverage out there so let us at Crikey highlight some of the best.

The utility with the nation’s biggest solar and wind investments NextEra Energy said up to three-quarters of its 2022 solar projects could be delayed until at least next year. The CEO of its subsidiary Florida Power & Light said the utility can’t find anyone in the U.S. willing to sell them more panels.

In a state-by-state survey by a solar trade group 84% of Florida solar companies surveyed reported cancellations or delays in their supply of solar panel parts.

And in the biggest sign of market chaos Orlando’s two newest solar farms were delayed a full year to 2024 and negotiations for the associated battery project were paused indefinitely.

The reason for the solar power delays and confusion in Florida and across the nation: An ongoing federal investigation into whether China was evading U.S. trade restrictions — and costly tariffs — by selling cheap panels through companies from other Southeast Asian countries. Some of the Asian companies targeted by the investigation have since slowed down or stopped importing to the U.S. over fears of hefty retroactive tariffs causing nationwide shortages and price spikes.

“We were in the middle of negotiations when these challenges popped up” Jan Aspuru chief operating officer of Orlando’s utility told the Orlando City Commission. “We will continue having discussions with our partner NextEra on the price impacts to these solar projects.”

The solar trade group survey estimated that shortages and the uncertainty surrounding the investigation puts $850 million of solar investment in Florida at risk. Industry executives also warned that delays could jeopardize the United States’ shot at meeting its climate goals and averting the worst impacts of climate change.

Last week 75 members of Congress (including Florida Democrats Debbie Wasserman Schultz Charlie Crist and Kathy Castor) wrote a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to quickly conclude a federal investigation due to the “severe negative consequences” on the solar industry.

But some trade groups argue that the investigation by the Department of Commerce is important to protect another growing part of the solar industry — American producers of panels who struggle to compete with cheap imports.

Eric Silagy CEO of Florida Power and Light the state’s largest utility said on a panel at Aspen Ideas Climate in Miami Beach in early May that the investigation has led to layoffs and delays nationwide.

“If we don’t address this quickly there will be a knock-on effect that will last for years. This is not something you can restart with a snap of the fingers” he said. “I can’t just get manufacturers. There are none in the United States that have panels available. We’ve gone to everybody that does and said we’ll buy anything you have. Give it to us. They say we don’t have any panels available.”

Shortages and delays in Florida

The solar shortage comes right off a recent win for the Florida rooftop solar industry the governor’s veto of a bill that would have made rooftop solar more expensive for homes and businesses.

Justin Vandenbroeck president of Florida Solar Energy Industries Association(SEIA) a trade group that represents more than 100 manufacturers solar contractors and financiers in Florida said he calls the uncertain ups and downs of the industry “the solar coaster.”

“It’s just tough. We feel like we just got this major win with the veto of the net metering bill and now this. We can’t catch a break” he said. “Between inflation and now supply shortages a lot of contractors are now feeling the pain.”

Vandenbroeck advised his members to be “resourceful” and fill the gaps with solar panels that were manufactured a few years back and not sold even though they’re not as efficient.

He also owns his own solar installation company and he’s had to delay a project to install solar on an AdventHealth facility in Central Florida because he couldn’t get the materials he needed.

South Florida-based Goldin Solar which installs rooftop solar on homes is also feeling the pinch. CEO Daren Goldin said he’s seen a 20% to 30% spike in costs for solar panels.

“We have panel manufacturers that we work with that are actually raising their panel prices not because they were hit with tariffs but because they’re hedging against the possibility of retroactive tariffs” he said.

In response Goldin said he’s had to adjust his contracts and ask clients to pay more up front rather than wait until a permit is approved.

Peter Andrew Bosch / Miami Herald Florida International University student Chloe Castro looks for the first time at the high-tech solar panels on Camillus House that she designed as part of a class project Friday Sept. 25 2015 in Miami. Her assignment: design a project to translate philanthropy into everyday life then persuade 27 classmates that hers was better than theirs.

But not everyone is reporting issues at least yet.

South Florida’s Solar United Neighbors a solar co-operative that helps homeowners and businesses join together for more affordable solar said it’s seen less disruption since most of their clients are using smaller arrays that are more likely to be produced in the U.S.

Heaven Campbell Florida program director for SUN said she hasn’t seen any delays or canceled projects yet.

“We hope that this goes away very quickly and there’s some more clarity very quickly” she said.

For FPL the concerns so far apply to future work not 2022 projects which are already completed said David Reuter chief communications officer for FPL. “At this point we’re working really closely with the suppliers… to ensure that there’s minimal if no disruption particularly as it pertains to our Florida build-out” he said.

Reuter said FPL has seen impacts in its energy resources division which provides large-scale installations for companies and communities but declined to detail any specific instances.

Are solar producers breaking the rules?

The disruption began in March when a small California-based solar panel manufacturer Axum Solar asked the Department of Commerce to investigate the possibility that manufacturers in the four countries that make up 80% of U.S. solar imports— Malaysia Cambodia Vietnam and Thailand — were skirting the U.S. duties by serving as a “pass-through” for Chinese solar panels.

The Commerce Department opened an investigation later that month generating a jolt of uncertainty over costs and supplies for the solar industry.

The U.S. government has long had trade concerns about panels from China. The Chinese government deeply subsidies the solar panels it manufactures allowing it to flood the market with products that undercut other makers. Some Chinese solar companies have also been blacklisted by the U.S. over allegations of slave labor. In response the Obama administration levied duties on Chinese panels which the Trump and Biden administration both renewed.

“There’s no doubt that the mere initiation of the investigation just in the first month has had an extremely negative impact on the solar industry across the country” said Reuter from FPL.

If the investigation scheduled to conclude in late August finds any wrongdoing — solar importers could get smacked with retroactive tariffs on anything shipped since the start of the investigation. They cover the price of the components and range from 12% to 250%.

Lori Wallach the director of our ReThink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project a group that supports the investigation believes the actual financial threat is limited and the industry reaction overblown. She said only a few importers have ever been hit with tariffs as high as 100% or 200% and they were wholly owned and operated by the Chinese government. She argued that the tariffs work exactly as intended and any new ones from the investigation would help the domestic market.

“It’s basically just taking the thumb off the scale for domestic producers” she said. “If you are a company with a 220% tariff we want to price you out of the market.”

Wallach also questioned why producers who knew they weren’t doing anything wrong would be afraid of the tariffs which have been in place for a decade.

But some sections of the solar industry especially groups representing installers that rely on cheap panels to turn a profit said the fear of those retroactive tariffs has scared suppliers into selling their goods to other countries instead of the U.S. slowing down or stopping the supply of panels.

The Solar Energy Industries Association an industry lobby group that also represents U.S. subsidiaries of some of the companies targeted in the investigation said internal surveys of its members show solar installation forecasts for this and next year are down by nearly half thanks to the investigation and pandemic supply chain issues.

Abigail Ross Hopper chief executive of SEIA wants to see the Department of Commerce end the investigation early. She pointed to the department’s multiple previous investigations into the Chinese solar dumping question all of which concluded that nothing was amiss.

“These are all questions that have been asked and answered by the department before on four different occasions” she said. “We think the evidence determines they should reach a negative conclusion.”

Building up domestic supply

One of the main reasons for the solar freeze in the U.S. is the state of the domestic solar panel manufacturing industry. It’s way too small experts say.

“We all want there to be a larger domestic source of solar panels that we can buy from but the reality is that industry has not changed significantly in the last five years” said Reuter from FPL. “The domestic industry in the US can supply about 20% of U.S. demand for panels.”

FPL has a leg up on other utilities in that regard because it has an agreement with one of the few companies that does some domestic manufacturing — China-based JinkoSolar which has a plant in Jacksonville. JinkoSolar one of the largest solar producers in the world is one of the companies under investigation.

Al Diaz / Miami Herald Surfside Mayor Daniel Dietch on the roof of his home powered by solar panels on Thursday November 12 2015.

On his panel last week FPL’s Silagy said he was instrumental in convincing Jinko to open in Florida.

“We bought every panel that they manufactured the entire output of the plant which is why they moved here initially” he said. “But unfortunately for them the cost structure is still more expensive than any other facility they have in their global supply chain.”

Florida is also home to another solar manufacturing site in Riviera Beach owned by Canadian-based Heliene. Neither Jinko not Heliene responded to requests for comment.

Hopper from SEIA also took issue with the idea that the Department of Commerce’s investigation would boost domestic production.

But one thing she and the groups supporting the investigation can agree on is what else could help: a suite of tax credits and incentives for domestic producers. The bill already passed the House of Representatives as part of the Biden administration’s Build Back Better act but it’s stuck in the Senate.

“It’s a much more stable and much more reliable way to bring more manufacturing to the U.S.” she said. “You can’t just snap your fingers and overnight spawn a domestic industry.”

Newly leaked images from House of Heat show the apparel from the upcoming Hello Kitty Collection between the Japanese company Sanrio and the Swoosh. Thus far the leaked imagery shows a white t-shirt featuring both “Nike Air” and “Hello Kitty” branding at the center along with blue shorts donning an all-over print of the cat character. Despite images of the apparel surfacing there are no leaked images available yet of the Hello Kitty x Nike Air Presto.

The Hello Kitty x Nike Air Presto was originally expected to hit shelves in ‘04 but the collab never officially saw a retail drop during its original run. Four different iterations of the shoe were created and 500 pairs of each style were reportedly produced. A rumored 12 pairs of each colorway were reportedly given out to friends and family of the brands making it one of the most elusive styles of the silhouette to ever be produced.

There’s currently no release info available for the upcoming Hello Kitty x Nike collection but check back soon to Sole Collector for official updates on the collab.

UPDATE (04/26): Official images of the Hello Kitty x Nike Air Presto collab have surfaced. As of now the Hello Kitty x Nike collection is scheduled to release sometime in May but the official details have not yet been announced by the Swoosh. Keep it locked to Sole Collector for updates.

UPDATE (05/03): The release date for the Hello Kitty x Nike collection has been announced. The latest update comes courtesy of a new landing page on Sanrio’s website which confirms that the collaborative Presto will launch on May 10 at 12 p.m. ET. There’s also a field where fans can subscribe via email for a reminder of the drop.

The project – formally called The Nike Icon Studios LA – is the flagship studio space for the company's operations for global brand imaging.

Located near LA's border with Culver City the building houses office space meeting rooms and studios for video and photography. Formerly these functions were spread across multiple locations.

""Now everything is under one roof enabling Nike to streamline their brand imaging operations"" said local firm LOHA.

The architects were tasked with creating a flexible environment within an existing concrete-and-steel building that totals 42000 square feet (3902 square metres).

The two-storey structure has a long linear footprint measuring 487 feet long by 86 feet wide (148 by 26 metres).

""Influenced by the base building's linear geometry the project is organized along a central spine that runs throughout serving as the primary circulation"" the architects said.

LOHA said it sought to create a workspace that met precise technical and performative requirements and embodied a pairing of art and science much like Nike's products. Adaptability was also a guiding concern.

""Each of the production spaces is built to the ideal specifications set by the requirements of their operations but also made to be modular re-combinable and entirely flexible"" the team said.

The ground level encompasses studios and support spaces for functions such as styling loading and storage. The upper level – which reads as a mezzanine – holds offices conference rooms and a post-production lab. Both floors have employee break areas.

Daylight flows in through skylights made of either glass or polycarbonate panels some of which have operable bi-fold doors that provide light control.

The centre of the building contains the main entry and a ""social core"" spanning two levels. Upstairs one finds a patio with wooden seating platforms dining furniture and ping-pong tables.

For interior finishes the team used purposeful materials and a colour palette mostly limited to white black and grey.

Underfoot is concrete flooring sealed with wax and rubber-cork flooring. Walls are made of white gypsum board walls with felt panelling or perforated metal panels used in certain areas.

Overhead there are elements to control sound such as fabric-wrapped panels acoustic plaster and ceiling sound baffles.

To help light flow through the building the team avoided solid surfaces where possible.

The main staircase is enclosed by walls made of a polypropylene industrial fabric that is draped over a steel frame. Upstairs glazed surfaces have varying levels of opacity depending upon the function of the room they border or enclose.

""This material layering provides a higher degree of light quality allowing light to pass from the perimeter into the building in an intentional and controlled way"" the team said.

""Functioning like a camera itself the studio is designed like a series of lenses that controls the light quality within.""

The building also features a number of artist-created murals many of which depict athletes associated with Nike and Los Angeles. Artists also created graphic wayfinding elements found in the facility.

LOHA emphasized that the building is meant to provide a physical place where people can come together – a particularly important consideration given the ongoing pandemic.

""The workplace is and will continue to be a rapidly changing organism"" the team said. ""Despite technological acceleration and work that is accessible anytime from anywhere there remains a vital need for spaces that connect us physically.""

Other office projects for Nike include two buildings on its main campus in Oregon – the Skylab-designed Serena Williams Building which is clad in armour-like plates and the Lebron James Innovation Center designed by Olson Kundig and wrapped in steel mesh.

Discover SCENE

RTFKT Nike’s Web3 arm now owns 10 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains following the purchase of dotswoosh.eth for 19.72 ETH roughly $35000. RTFKT is pronounced “artifact.”

Nike’s exact reason for the dotswoosh purchase on Friday remains unclear. But as some have pointed out on Twitter Nike may have plans to use the domain for issuing ENS subdomains in the future. ENS subdomains are controlled by the main domain name holder.

For example Nike could allow holders of specific NFTs or other assets the ability to register an ENS subdomain under dotswoosh.eth (kate.dotswoosh.eth would be one such example).

Graphic designer Carolyn Davidson created Nike’s iconic swoosh logo back in 1971 and was reportedly only paid $35 for her work. So Nike’s 19.72 ETH purchase price may be a nod to the year 1972 which was when Davidson’s swoosh logo first appeared on shoes.

In addition to dotswoosh.eth RTFKT also owns artifacts.eth rtfkt.eth skinvial.eth drmos.eth mintvial.eth dreamos.eth spacedrip.eth dripcoin.eth and m2tekno.eth.

Nike’s ENS plays do appear to be a part of a larger strategy based on its current holdings. The Mint Vial is likely a reference to the CloneX Mint Vial Ethereum NFTs which can be burned to create a unique CloneX avatar NFT.

Space Drip is a reference to Nike’s Space Drip NFTs which are digital shoe NFTs that allow the holder to “forge” a physical version of the sneakers. RTFKT's Skin Vials are also NFTs that can be burned to change the look of Nike’s RTFKT CryptoKicks which launched last month.

Whatever its plans are for dotswoosh.eth Nike has a track record of buying and trademarking a wide range of affiliated names and logos. Last year it filed trademarks for Nike Nikeland and “Just Do It” for a broad range of metaverse applications as well as its Nike swoosh and “Jumpman” logos.

A train crash just outside of Pittsburgh has created a spill of petroleum distillates along the Allegheny River.

Seventeen cars in total were derailed in Harmar Township near the city’s North Side with nine ending up in a creek just outside the river officials said.

Initial reports suggested that some of the cars were leaking sweet crude into the river but a statement on Friday from Norfolk Southern the train operator said that leaking cars had contained “petroleum distillates” which are derivatives of crude oil and plastic pellets WPXI reports.

Norfolk Southern’s statement said there were “no immediate signs of release from the petroleum distillate cars in the water” but that some plastic pellets had escaped and were contained by booms in the water.

The train derailed after hitting a truck reports the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The truck driver and two train operators were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries they add.

The county is asking the public to avoid the area for a few days as crews work to clean up the crash.

A water line was initially broken but has been restored. Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority said there have been no impacts to drinking water.

The Allegheny is one of three major rivers in Pittsburgh as it merges with the Monongahela River downtown to form the start of the Ohio River. Train lines run along all three rivers in the city a former hub for industries like steel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvcm9ja2FiaWxseS1tdXNpYy1sZWdlbmQtcm9ubmllLWhhd2tpbnMtZGVhZC1hdC04Ny9hcnRpY2xlX2Y4M2Y5OWQ1LTFhNGYtNTg3NS1iZGIwLWI5Y2NkZDFlYjEyMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rockabilly music legend Ronnie Hawkins dead at 87 | Trending | fox13memphis.com,"Weather Alert

MISS: There are times when some public servants seem so hopelessly out of touch with reality the best thing we can do is just print their actual words and let you judge for yourselves what is fair and what is simply tone-deaf arrogance.

As tens of thousands of you are painfully aware the payments to victims of wildfires from the Fire Victim Trust Fund have been slow in coming. So slow in fact that the Butte County Board of Supervisors sent a letter this week to the judge overseeing the case Justice John K. Trotter expressing their concerns while asking for some updates.

Trotter is the trustee overseeing the Fire Victim Trust Fund. For his efforts he is paid a handsome $125000 per month according to the Fire Victim Trust agreement.

You’d expect someone earning that kind of money in that kind of position to at least show signs of empathy and understanding to such a request — a request we found completely reasonable and well-stated.

You will likely be shocked by his response.

From here we will print the words of the supervisors’ letter and then the judge’s reaction.

First the supervisors’ letter dated Tuesday May 24:

“Dear Judge Trotter

“The Board of Supervisors has read the Fire Victim Trust Fund statement regarding the annual report for January 1 2021 through December 31 2021 and is compelled to write in advocacy of our constituents.

“Currently the Fire Victim Trust has not evaluated all the claims has only paid out a small percentage of funds and has amassed over $93 million in administrative costs. This is unacceptable. Almost 70000 people affected by these fires and the communities they live in have had their lives derailed. Lack of communication minimal payments and disregard for those individuals most affected by wildfire are the current trademarks of the Fire Victims Fund. This fund was intended to compensate fire survivors for the losses they suffered not become a well-paying job for massive legal teams. The current situation requires that the following questions be answered:

— “What dollar amount has been distributed to each fire? Please include individual breakdown.

— “How many claims have been filed by fire?

— “What is the total monthly expense to administer the trust inclusive of all staff?

— “How much have all of the attorneys received as of now?

— “Why has only $3.4 billion been distributed out of $13.5 billion?

— “How long before the trust distributes all funds?

“Many survivors of the Camp Fire find themselves unable to move on with their lives until they receive their settlements. Thousands of our residents continue to live in temporary conditions; many are living in RVs some have long worn out their welcome at their friends’ or families’ couches and unfortunately some have ended up unhoused and on the streets.

“We urge you to prioritize these individuals in your determination process. We can provide you the names and contact information for these individuals whose lives are on hold pending your work.”

The letter ended with the signature of board president Bill Connelly and the phone number of Assistant Chief Administrative Officer Brian Ring

And boy did Judge Trotter jump at the opportunity to make that call to Ring.

Here are his words transcribed verbatim.

“Mr. Ring this is Justice Trotter the trustee of the Fire Victims Trust. I’m calling in response to that offensive uninformed political statement that you people sent to me. I’m not interested in dealing with you based on what you’ve put out. If you really want to know anything about the trust I would assume like everybody else you would call and ask rather than coming to uninformed slanderous conclusions. Uh I have 400 people that work on this trust that are working very very hard to accomplish a very difficult and (pause) and so when and if you get to that point I’ll talk to you. But I’m not going to engage based on that nonsense that’s in your letter. Thank you.”

Where to even begin?

Nonsense? “You people?” I’m not interested in dealing with you?

Every concern in the supervisors’ letter was well-founded (and stated much more professionally than Trotter’s over-the-top response). An excellent investigative piece by NPR and PBS last summer backs it up.

This judge’s response may do more to further damage the already toxic relationship between the wildfire victims and the Trust than anything else could have done. For him to disregard this letter filled with completely legitimate concerns of true victims of wildfire as “nonsense” and “uninformed” is the height of arrogance a callous flip-off to people who are guilty of nothing other than being burned out of their homes.

It’s enough to make you wonder if the judge forgot who the real victims are here.

Hint: It’s not the guy making $125000 per month.

Note: This editorial was updated to correct the amount of Judge Trotter’s compensation which was originally reported at $1500 per hour.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vaW50cmlndWVzLWFzLXJpY2UtZmFybWVycy1wcm9jZXNzb3JzLWZlYXItcmVzdXJnZW5jZS1vZi1zbXVnZ2xpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intrigues as rice farmers processors fear resurgence of smuggling,"By Vincent A. Yusuf (Abuja) Abubakar Akote (Minna) Ibrahim Musa Giginyu (Kano) & Mahmoud Idris Katsina

In the last two years Nigerian rice farmers and processors have had relief from the menace of smuggling which for years made the country a very good market for perpetrators.

Since the advent of COVID-19 and restriction of movement smuggling activities went down but recent reports of massive arrest of smugglers by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and the availability of foreign rice in the markets raise the concern that smuggling is perhaps back.

Smuggling is driven by the desire of some Nigerians who still believe imported rice has superior processed quality than the Nigerian rice.

Daily Trust on Sunday gathered that some processors and traders are adopting different techniques to survive in the market.

Some dealers who trade in smuggled rice don’t display it for buyers to see. A buyer has to demand for it and agree to the price before the rice is brought out especially in areas likely to be raided by men of the NCS.

The desire for foreign rice by some Nigerians has pushed the country’s local rice processors to adopt the use of foreign addresses and contacts on their packaging materials as measures to woo consumers to patronise their products.

It was gathered that despite the mantra that Nigeria is self-sufficient in local rice there is still foreign rice everywhere in the country with some reports suggesting that processors do not have enough paddies for processing while smuggling is coming back in full force.

Some processors in Niger State said they had enough paddy rice but were constrained by the desire of some Nigerians who prefer foreign products.

Investigations revealed that a larger percentage of bags of rice with foreign addresses in the Nigerian market were locally processed and packaged in Nigeria.

Processors lamented low patronage from consumers due to ineffectiveness of the federal government’s policy on ban of importation of foreign rice.

The local processors dismissed the insinuations that they didn’t have enough paddy rice to process and take to the market the reason the foreign ones still flood the Nigerian market

Abdulkadir Nurudeen of Yabcom Rice Mill Bida said “There are many factors but the major one is inconsistency in government’s policy in the sense that the government could not effectively enforce the ban on importation of foreign rice. Also government is only empowering political farmers instead of real ones. For instance the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) was only empowering politicians rather than the real farmers.

“Some of these politicians would buy up to 7000 hectares of inputs which are being sold to the direct market instead of the farmers. They will come back to the market and compete with producers and small-scale businesses that are into processing.

“The problem is that they consider anything when they are buying because they also need to buy to recover having sold up their inputs which are supposed to be used for farming. So when the time for their recovery comes they go to the direct market with money to compete with people that are processing leading to scarcity of paddies. So the producer will end up not having enough paddies to process.”

“The same government trying to fight for producers and encourage indigenous rice production is also killing it through inconsistency in policy and inefficiency to build up the policy it came up with.

“In fact the policy only causes the masses and local rice processors more hardship. It is not as if the country doesn’t have enough paddies to process and take to the market they are being mopped up by government’s agents to serve as their own recovery because they were given money to produce what they didn’t produce. Therefore after the mop up you know what they give them as a recovery sum. Somebody like me cannot buy it and even if I want to I will do it at a give-away price.

“For example on the pyramid they did in Abuja they told us that we would be given allocations and some of the prices they gave us were obtainable in our local markets. Eventually we learnt that even the allocations they gave us were also being sold to a bigger company. So the whole thing is just a cycle of corruption” Nurudeen observed.

Another processor Maikudi Sani told our correspondent that it was not true that local processors did not have enough paddies to process and supply to market.

“The problem we have with our people is that they prefer foreign things. Even when there was sensitisation that local rice is better and more nutritious than the imported ones our people just want to be seen eating foreign rice. Sometimes even if we process you would see people asking to buy foreign rice in the market they don’t buy our own.

“We have enough paddies that can sustain Nigeria but we are discouraged with low patronage because you would spend your money and process and package rice and at the end of the day people won’t buy. If there is a market we have enough paddies to process. We went as far as collaborating with some cooperatives to encourage their members to patronise us but it didn’t work out” he said.

The Niger State programme coordinator International Fund for Agricultural Development Value Chain Development Programme (IFAD-VCDP) Mathew Ahmed also debunked the report that local rice processors did not have enough paddies at their disposal.

He revealed that most of the rice in sacks with foreign addresses in Nigerian markets were locally processed pointing out that local processors have devised a way of wooing Nigerians to patronise them with the use of foreign addresses on their packaging materials.

“The rice being produced in Nigeria is self-sufficient but our markets are being littered with foreign rice because of the mentality of Nigerians that anything that comes from abroad is better than what is being locally produced. So most of the processors will go and print their branded sacks and other packaging materials and put foreign addresses as if they were coming from Thailand and all that. There are enough paddies at the disposal of our local processors. It is not true that we don’t have enough paddies.

A trader in Kure Ultra-Modern Market Minna Niger State who spoke in confidence confirmed to Daily Trust on Sunday that most varieties of the rice they sell in foreign sacks are locally processed.

“Because they don’t get patronage some local processors have stopped using their company names. They use foreign brand names; and they are selling. So it is not every rice you see in foreign sacks that is actually imported they are processed here in Nigeria.”

A customer who shared his experience with our correspondent said “During the month of Ramadan I bought a bag of 50kg rice I thought was rice but when I got home and opened it I discovered that it was local rice packaged in a foreign bag.”

In Kano State despite the proliferation of many rice mills investigations conducted by our reporter revealed that rice paddy is not an issue for now because milling companies have been receiving it constantly.

A visit to UMZA International Farms Limited producers of Sarauniya Rice and other three brands of milled rice in the state revealed a very long queue of trucks loaded with paddies waiting to be uploaded. According to one of the truck drivers on the queue he had spent two days waiting to be uploaded.

Similar scenarios were observed in most of the mega rice mills visited such as Popular Rice Mills.

One of the millers Alhaji Isa Nasiru told our reporter that for now the market seems to be saturated with paddy and mills are having more than enough despite the said border opening.

“Look around here and at other mills you will find out that we have enough paddy supply from many parts of the country. To be honest with you I am afraid if the mills would be able to mop up the paddy in our markets” he said.

It was gathered that most of the paddies are from dry season farming and farmers are presently getting ready for wet season. It was also revealed that supplies to Kano were from Taraba and Gombe states and other North East rice-producing states as well as neighbouring African nations.

Another miller Usman Bello Bulama said that despite insecurity challenges and other issues coupled with the border reopening rice paddy supply to mills in the state remains stable. According to him millers are getting the paddy at an average of N17000 per bag. He added that the only issue negatively affecting millers was the cost of transportation due to diesel price hike.

“Millers’ major concern in Kano State for now is high cost of transportation. We are facing about a 100 per cent increase in cost of transportation” he lamented.

But the same cannot be said of Katsina State which is battling insecurity and making it impossible for farmers to provide adequate paddy for millers in the state.

Aminu Murtala a rice miller in Funtua said that sustainability in rice production required huge investment in irrigation system to complement rain-fed production.

“No matter the volume of rice produced in wet season it hardly reaches us to April; and we are not as lucky as farmers in the far northern part of the state that have Sabke Ajiwa and Zobe dams for irrigation farming. What we have in this Funtua zone are few small irrigation dams that cover only production of tomato and other vegetables” he said.

Murtala added that their hope for the construction of gigantic Jare dam in Bakori is fast waning considering the slow pace of the work.

He further said that before the escalation of insecurity in the North West and Niger State millers sourced paddy rice from Bagudo in Kebbi State and some parts of Niger.

“Insecurity is now hampering us from sourcing paddy rice in Kebbi Niger and Kwara states; that is the main reason for the escalation of market price of the produce” Aminu Murtala said.

On the issue of smuggling in of foreign rice Sagir Sani a rice dealer at Funtua Market said he could not say what is actually happening at the borders but the demand for foreign rice remains low when compared to the last five years.

“Restaurants and other food sellers are now the major buyers of foreign rice because it is more profitable to them despite its high market price. The general demand of the produce is on local rice considering its availability and low price” he said.

Sani added that because of the stiff restrictions on foreign rice they were purchasing a 50kg bag at not less than N29000 and selling a measure at N1800.

On the other hand a local milled rice was sold at N48000 per 100kg bag and a measure sold at N1300.

He said there were indications that the market price of local rice would continue to rise in the next three months.

Sule Bello one of the rice millers in Dandume said most of them were mere service providers to consumers.

“Because it is becoming hard to source paddy rice we resorted to providing services of milling rice for individuals at the rate of N2500 per bag of paddy. And the cost of diesel and dwindling electricity supply are not helping matters in the business” Bello said.",,,,,,,,,

The PBS World Channel will also air the documentary at 7 p.m. Monday 12 a.m. Tuesday and 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. June 5. For those who wish to watch the program at their leisure or download it here is a link: https://vimeo.com/646179241.

The 57-minute film is the result of a three-year collaboration between the Children of the Doolittle Raiders (CDR) a nonprofit group I lead and producer/director Bill Einreinhofer a faculty member at the New York Film Academy who has developed and produced programming for ABC CBS Discovery HBO and Public Television.

Through interviews with the children of five Doolittle Raiders and one Honorary Raider “Unsettled History” tells the stories of Bill Bower a happy-go-lucky military pilot who grew up in Ohio; Tom Griffin a former college boxer born in Green Bay Wis.; Tung-Sheng Liu a university student in war-torn China; Herb Macia a University of Arizona football player and Air Cadet; Charles Ozuk a Chicago-raised aviator and the son of immigrants; and my father David Thatcher a farm boy from Montana who always dreamed of flying. Also interviewed is historian and author James M. Scott.

The story begins on April 18 1942. Sixteen U.S. Army air crews are about to embark on their first combat mission. It might be their last. The B-25 bombers they are flying were never intended to launch from an aircraft carrier. But the significantly modified aircraft are about to do exactly that in a mission to bomb Japan in retaliation for Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 1941.

The 16 planes have enough fuel to reach their targets: military and industrial sites in Tokyo and five other Japanese cities. But there’s no guarantee that they will get much further. And even if they somehow make their way to China and relative safety no one knows they are coming.

The challenge in developing the documentary was to see beyond old black and white pictures to discover the individuals who lived this story. And who better to tell the stories of the Doolittle Raiders than their children along with the children and grandchildren of the men and women who rescued many of the Raiders in China preventing their capture torture and even death at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army? For those efforts an estimated 250000 Chinese were later slaughtered by the Japanese.

While the results of the Doolittle Raid were modest the mission helped lead to a turning point in World War II by forcing the Japanese to recall combat forces for home defense and boosted morale among Americans and U.S. allies abroad.

In early June 1942 less than two months after the Doolittle Raid the U.S. would defeat Japanese forces in the Battle of Midway resulting in the loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers and changing the course of the war in the Pacific.

Time has done what enemy antiaircraft fire and fighter planes could not. It has taken the lives of all the Doolittle Raiders and effectively removed their story from public memory. Today most Americans don’t know who the Doolittle Raiders were what they did or why it was important. Keeping that memory alive is the mission of the CDR. A retired university professor and a group of volunteers in China’s Jiangxi province are working to preserve the memory as well.

“Unsettled History” is the culmination of three years of production. It incorporates little-seen footage located in film libraries around the world as well as original interviews and scenic footage shot specifically for the documentary.

The program also includes links to educational materials suggested classroom activities and additional footage all free of charge.

This year marks the 80th anniversary of the Doolittle Raid. The last Doolittle Raider Col. Richard E. “Dick” Cole died April 9 2019 at the age of 103.

On April 18 at a ceremony in Fort Walton Beach Fla. Cole’s silver goblet the last of 80 such vessels made for each of the Doolittle Raiders with their names inscribed right side up while alive and upside down after they died was turned over by his two surviving children after a toast to the Raiders that was led by U.S. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall and included Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown Jr. and two other Air Force generals. The ceremony drew more than 70 Raider family members along with hundreds of invited guests.

The Raiders’ memory is also being kept alive by the development of the new B-21 Raider named after the crew in a ceremony attended by Dick Cole in 2016. The B-21 is a heavy stealth bomber under development for the Air Force by Northrop Grumman.

The B-21 Raider will be a component of a larger family of systems for conventional Long Range Strike including Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance electronic attack communication and other capabilities according to the Air Force. It will be nuclear capable and designed to accommodate manned or unmanned operations. Additionally it will be able to employ a broad mix of standoff and direct-attack munitions.

According to a recent report in Air Force Magazine the B-21 Raider is on track in both its development and cost. The Air Force is considering buying at least 100 and possibly up to 145 of the stealth bombers from Northrop Grumman.

In an Air Force budget proposal the service branch is slated to spend $20 billion for the B-21 program over the next five years according to online publication 1945. The first B-21 is slated to be unveiled later this year with the first flight scheduled for 2023. The Air Force has not introduced a new bomber in more than 30 years.

The B-21 is slated to eventually replace the B-1 and B-2 stealth bombers now in service with the new aircraft stationed at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota and Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri according to the Air Force.

The 420th Flight Test Squadron based at Edwards AFB in California will plan test analyze and report on all flight and ground testing of the B-21 Raider before the bombers become active at Ellsworth according to the Air Force. A B-21 maintenance depot will also be established at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City.

The B-21 program is in the engineering and manufacturing development phase focused on scaling infrastructure capacity for the manufacturing of the nuclear-capable aircraft.

“Nuclear modernization is a top priority for the Department of Defense and the Air Force and the B-21 is key to that plan” said Randall Walden director and program executive officer for the Department of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. “The built-in feature of open systems architecture on the B-21 makes the bomber effective as the threat environment evolves. This aircraft design approach sets the nation on the right path to ensuring America’s enduring air power capability.” The Air Force awarded the B-21 Engineering and Manufacturing Development contract to Northrop Grumman on Oct. 27 2015. Northrop Grumman’s partners on the B-21 program include Pratt & Whitney Janicki Industries Collins Aerospace GKN Aerospace BAE Systems and Spirit Aerosystems.

In 2018 the program successfully conducted the weapon systems Critical Design Review a comprehensive program-wide evaluation of design maturity stability and risk. The Air Force plans to incrementally replace the B-1 Lancer and the B-2 Spirit bombers to form a two-bomber fleet of B-21s and modified B-52s.

According to the Air Force’s fact sheet on the aircraft a minimum of 100 B-21s are planned to be built at an average cost of approximately $550 million apiece.

The Air Force said the B-21 program is on track to deliver B-21s to Ellsworth AFB in the mid-2020s. Ellsworth will host the training program and be home to the first B-21 planes and squadron.

The pending arrival of the B-21 is also expected to bring in thousands of new residents construction projects and economic growth across the Black Hills according to Dakota Public Broadcasting.

James Kowalski a former general with the Air Force who now works as a vice president for Northrup Grumman Corp. said the bombers can fly long distances evade detection through stealth technology and drop traditional and nuclear bombs. They can also quickly sync and adapt to new weapons technology and parts.

“It’s an open architecture and what I mean by that is you can very quickly upgrade and update” Kowalski said adding that six B-21s are in production and one is already in testing.

The designation B-21 recognizes the Raider as the first bomber of the 21st century.

“We’re just getting started” said Vice Adm. Jon Hill at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The MDA is working on a wide array of missile tracking sensors and defeat capabilities to build a “layered” defense against incoming ballistic and hypersonic missiles.

The GPI is one of them which is supposed to target hypersonic missiles during the glide phase of flight (once a missile has re-entered Earth’s atmosphere and is heading toward its target) which is challenging to forecast as the missiles travel at five times the speed of sound while making rapid evasive maneuvers.

The interceptors will be integrated into the current Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense destroyers in the US Navy which would involve the interceptor being launched from its regular Vertical Launch System (VLS) connected with the Baseline 9 Aegis Weapon System that detects tracks controls and engages hypersonic threats.

Last year in November the MDA-selected Northrop Grumman Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to design Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI). Raytheon Missiles and Defense was granted $20.97 million Lockheed Martin $20.94 million and Northrop Grumman $18.95 million respectively. Each vendor is supposed to provide concept designs for prototypes by September 2022.

“We’ve got three great proposals and we may decide to stay on three may drop to two may drop to one. So it just really kind of depends” said Hill.

Chinese Russian Hypersonic Missile

In recent times the US is increasingly becoming worried about the threat posed by hypersonic weapons from China and Russia.

In July of last year China tested its hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) sparking widespread concern and panic among the US military’s brass. The glide vehicle traveled around 24800 miles (39911 km) in space before re-entering the atmosphere and striking the ground target according to a report by US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).

The DIA report reads that the flight test lasted more than 100 minutes making it “the greatest distance flew and longest flight time of any Chinese land-attack weapons system to date.”

China is known to have a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) known as Dong Feng-17 (DF-17) which is capable of carrying the DF-ZF HGV. The missile itself can travel at a speed of Mach 5-10 and carry conventional or nuclear weapons. It has a range of 1800-2500km and a launch weight of 15000kgs.

The DF-ZF HGV can travel at speeds between Mach 5-10 and is said to be capable of performing evasive maneuvers to tackle the enemy defenses. The DF-17 is a ground-launched missile; an air-launched version may be developed that can be deployed on the Xian H-6N bomber – the latest variant of the H-6 series bombers based on the Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 twin-engine jet bombers.

The H-6N has a range of 8000 km and if armed with DF-17 its range can extend up to 10000 – 11000 km bringing the key enemy installations across the entire Indo-Pacific within its range.

A video surfaced in 2020 showing the H-6N bomber landing at an unknown airfield carrying a missile with a warhead and booster section on the bottom of its fuselage which appeared to be similar to the DF-17 hypersonic missile.

Meanwhile Russia has also developed the Avangard HGV with a range of over 6000 km capable of carrying both nuclear and conventional payloads. According to a TASS report the HGV’s nuclear warhead is “more than two megatons in TNT equivalent.”

Currently the Avangard is carried by the SS-19 “Stiletto” (UR-100NUTTH) ballistic missile but it is slated to be replaced by the R-28 Sarmat that has just been successfully tested and planned to be deployed later this year.

According to claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin the HGV can cruise at atmospheric speeds of up to Mach 20 and it can maneuver to make its trajectory unpredictable for interception by air and missile defense systems. Plus it can reportedly deploy countermeasures during flight to confuse the defense systems.

SM-6 Interceptor

Currently the only counter-hypersonic capability the US has is the SM-6 series interceptor although the particular version of the missile is not known yet. The SM-6 can intercept the hypersonic weapon in its terminal phase – on its final approach to the target.

Considering the high speed of hypersonic weapons the coverage of the terminal-phase SM-6 interceptor is just too low and therefore the MDA’s GPI program is crucial to the agency’s future work defending against hypersonic missile threats as it would target hypersonic missiles farther away during the glide phase of flight.

Also MDA and the Space Development Agency are currently working on the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) that would assist the current missile warning/tracking satellites that could lose hypersonic missiles after their boost phase.

The HBTSS is supposed to be able to detect a missile launch as well as the first second and third-stage separation. Once the GPI is fired by the Aegis BMD system on a Navy destroyer it would be connected to HBTSS for updated tracking data and the interceptor would kill the threat before it got too close to its intended target.

The HBTSS is planned to be launched into orbit next year for a demonstration.",,,

Wyoming has bet its future on carbon capture technology.

The state has poured money into research on how to remove carbon dioxide from industrial emissions and what to do with the gas once it has been captured. State lawmakers have passed laws to encourage carbon capture and regulations to govern it.

As many other states and nations have tried to wean themselves off fossil fuels Wyoming has done the opposite: In 2020 Gov. Mark Gordon signed a law—the first in the nation—that requires electrical utilities to generate some of their power from coal plants fitted with carbon capture equipment.

Wyoming produces 40 percent of the nation’s coal and relies on fossil fuels to generate nearly 60 percent of state and local revenues. The goal has been to find a way for the coal industry to thrive even as the nation reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

We’re hiring! Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobs

But two years later Wyoming may be no closer to willing this coal-friendly climate solution into being. In March the utilities covered by the law submitted filings to regulators saying that carbon capture was not economically feasible. Retrofitting their plants would cost hundreds of millions of dollars at the least they said forcing them to raise customers’ electricity bills.

Beyond that the filings said operating carbon capture equipment could spike water use at the coal plants and increase emissions of some air pollutants as well as solid and liquid waste.

Energy companies labor unions and each of the last four presidential administrations have held out carbon capture and storage as a technology that could help the nation reduce greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to burn fossil fuels. The technology has played an important role in the Biden administration’s climate policy.

Last year’s infrastructure bill included more than $12 billion to help pull carbon dioxide from smokestack emissions and straight from the atmosphere. Some states have also joined in: California recently said it will rely partly on carbon capture to meet its climate targets though primarily in the industrial sector rather than for electrical generation.

Nowhere is the support as strong as in Wyoming which is an ideal testing ground. The state has abundant coal reserves and the right geology to store captured carbon dioxide. Perhaps most importantly the technology has the unequivocal backing of political leaders who have stated their intention to use carbon capture to protect their coal industry.

“We put all our eggs in one basket” said Dan Zwonitzer who sponsored the 2020 carbon capture bill. “We champion coal. And so if we’re going to do that we’ve got to find ways to make sure it can carry us into the future. And I think CCUS is a way that we need to find” he said using an acronym for carbon capture utilization and storage.

Yet so far the technology has failed to catch on commercially there or elsewhere. And many economists and policy experts say it is unlikely to play a significant role in helping eliminate emissions from the power sector. “There are so many other cheaper and cleaner ways to decarbonize electricity that I don’t see carbon capture as likely to have a big role” said Dan Cohan an associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University. “The economics just don’t make sense.”

Some carbon capture companies have disputed the negative conclusions of the two Wyoming utilities Rocky Mountain Power and Black Hills Energy that submitted the filings. Other supporters of the technology say the analysis is sound but that the world will need carbon capture on coal plants to meet climate goals and that the federal government should bear the costs.

But the Wyoming filings make clear that even with conditions primed in favor of the technology the utilities would rather convert their coal plants to burn natural gas or simply close them down than install carbon capture equipment. And even Zwonitzer concedes that the 2020 bill he sponsored is far from achieving its goal.

“We are not where we thought we’d be three years ago” he said “and I’m not sure where we’re going over the next year.”

Wyoming’s Climate Plan

In October of 2019 PacifiCorp which owns Rocky Mountain Power accelerated the timeline for closing four units at two of its Wyoming coal plants. The nation’s coal production was continuing to slide and states were passing bills aiming to speed their transitions off fossil fuel power.

“We thought ‘OK that’s one way for a state to do it’” said Randall Luthi chief energy adviser to Gov. Gordon. But the problem wasn’t really coal Luthi said. The problem was the emissions released by its combustion “So how do you burn coal and not release CO2?”

Luthi spoke with lawmakers regulators and energy companies and the result was House Bill 200. The law required the state’s utilities to generate a portion of their power from coal plants fitted with carbon capture equipment and directed state regulators to come up with the details. The final rules direct utilities to submit plans for producing at least 20 percent of their power with coal plants fitted with carbon capture technology by 2030 unless the companies can demonstrate that doing so is not feasible.

“This is the Wyoming climate change plan essentially” said Shannon Anderson staff attorney at the Powder River Basin Resource Council a Wyoming environmental group. She said the law has put the state in a bind and may force costs onto its residents and businesses in the form of higher electric bills.

Zwonitzer the bill’s sponsor said the state had no choice.

“We’ve gotten so Republican that even mentioning a tax increase will get you thrown out of office” said Zwonitzer who is a Republican. “There are no other revenue sources really outside of taxation on either our people or our minerals. So we’re currently trying to figure out how to keep taxing our minerals.”

While carbon capture has not yet worked commercially Zwonitzer said maybe it could if the state forced utilities to adopt it. “It’s almost mandatory for us to find a way to do this” he said.

Not Feasible ‘At This Time’

When the law passed in 2020 the potential impact on residents or utilities was speculative. The March filings made them real.

Black Hills Energy said that building carbon capture operations on two of its coal units would cost about $506 million and $474 million respectively. The second figure represents three times what it cost to build one of the coal generation units in the first place the filing said. If the costs were borne by ratepayers that would mean an increase of as much as 16 percent or $25 per month for the average residential customer. The operations would also siphon off more than a third of the units’ electrical output Black Hills said so it would have to build additional generation or have customers reduce their consumption.

Black Hills also said the carbon capture operations “may have an impact on ambient air quality in the area” because they have the potential to increase the emissions of certain pollutants. The increased demand for water “would apply stress on existing aquifers in the area” the company wrote.

Rocky Mountain Power the other utility said in the filing “There is not a portfolio standard that is economically feasible at this time.”

Both Black Hills and Rocky Mountain Power determined that the best carbon capture technology was a version that used an “amine-based solvent.” As they break down these solvents can form toxic carcinogens according to the Environmental Defense Fund. Last month the advocacy group submitted comments to the White House Council on Environmental Quality warning that the release of these chemicals “may pose serious hazards to workers and the public near capture facilities” but that the risks were not well understood.

“A lot of folks think about carbon capture as a way to address the environmental impacts of the coal industry but honestly what these filings show is that it just creates environmental problems” Anderson said.

However Michael Nasi a partner at the Texas law firm Jackson Walker who has represented coal and utility interests said the filings by Rocky Mountain Power and Black Hills failed to recognize the economic potential for carbon capture operations.

Nasi was among those who Luthi consulted when drafting the 2020 bill. He is a strong advocate for carbon capture and he represented NRG Energy when it built the nation’s only commercial-scale carbon capture operation at a U.S. coal plant outside Houston. The operation called Petra Nova ran for about three years before it ceased capturing carbon dioxide in 2020.

In Wyoming Nasi has been representing a small energy company called Glenrock Energy that has been trying to build a carbon capture project at one of Rocky Mountain Power’s coal plants. Glenrock wants to use the captured carbon dioxide to squeeze oil out of a nearby depleted petroleum reservoir through a practice called “enhanced oil recovery.”

“They don’t see it for what it really is” Nasi said of the utilities. “It’s very similar to basically a large industrial customer that instead of building widgets makes carbon and that carbon can be sold into the oil market with a bunch of very thirsty enhanced oil recovery projects that can use the CO2.”

Glenrock would pay for the carbon capture equipment Nasi said using its own financing. Ratepayers would not have to cover the costs. This is the model that Petra Nova used.

“Petra Nova was an oil project that had a very successful CCS demonstration built within it” Nasi said.

That dependence on oil brought its own risks however. It was the pandemic crash in oil prices NRG said that prompted it to halt operations in 2020. The carbon capture project has not restarted.

Nasi suggested a number of changes to the Wyoming legislation that remained in the final version according to emails provided to Inside Climate News by the Energy and Policy Institute a nonprofit watchdog group. The changes accelerated the timeline for when utilities would have to install carbon capture equipment moving the date to 2030 from 2040 and requiring the public service commission to come up with interim targets.

Nasi told Inside Climate News that the changes provided “adequate urgency” by forcing the utilities to move faster.

Black Hills declined to comment on the filings because they are part of an open docket with the public service commission.

PacifiCorp spokesman David Eskelsen said the company has not considered carbon capture to be viable in its own planning “due to the high capital cost.”

Still both companies said in the filings that they would continue to pursue installing carbon capture equipment at their plants as directed by state law. Black Hills said it would seek federal funding from the Energy Department. Rocky Mountain Power asked regulators to approve a $3.1 million annual surcharge on customers to fund the ongoing study.

‘A Huge Burden to Bear’

Many independent experts have already arrived at the conclusion that the prospects for coal with carbon capture in the U.S. power sector are dim. John Thompson technology and markets director of the environmental organization Clean Air Task Force doesn’t disagree but he said he thinks the technology holds great promise in Asia and that Wyoming could serve as a test case. Thompson’s group is one of a few environmental nonprofits advocating for federal spending on carbon capture for this reason.

Thompson pointed to data from the International Energy Agency showing that as of 2020 the majority of China’s coal emissions came from plants that were less than 10 years old. China’s coal emissions are greater than all the greenhouse gas emissions produced in the United States and they hit their highest level last year.

“I just don’t see how we solve the climate problem without carbon capture on coal” Thompson said. “And if we don’t solve it in China it’s game over on climate it really is.”

Thompson said fitting carbon capture technology onto Wyoming coal plants could help demonstrate a technology that could be deployed on a vast scale in China and other parts of Asia. But he said he’d want to see some changes to what the utilities are considering. He noted that the filings consider systems that would capture 90 percent of the emissions from the coal plants while that figure should be at least 95 percent. He also said they should pursue a different “dry-cooling” technology that would dramatically cut water use. Both changes would increase the costs of construction.

But Ian Lange an economist at the Colorado School of Mines who has served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers and studied carbon capture said he is skeptical that the economics will be much different in Asia. In the United States and Europe he said governments and utilities have spent years and billions of dollars trying to make the economic model work and “it basically didn’t.”

Wyoming will be the latest trial. The state law included provisions that give the utilities options to delay or possibly avoid installing carbon capture equipment as long as they can convince regulators that doing so would not be feasible.

Anderson with the Powder River Basin Resource Council said the public service commission should step in now to halt the process and prevent the utilities from raising rates for further study.

“Wyoming legislators made a policy choice to do something that none of the other states have done probably would never do and Wyoming customers have to bear the costs” she said. “It’s a huge burden to bear.”

Zwonitzer the bill’s sponsor insisted that any costs would be manageable. He said the state now has to wait for regulators to respond to the filings before determining what comes next. But he said Wyoming has little choice but to continue pursuing carbon capture technology.

“Am I gung-ho about it still? No. But do I think we have a couple of years to keep pushing the envelope and see where we end up? Yes” he said. “I think one day we’re going to wake up in Wyoming and coal will be gone and our economy will be devastated. So it’s my hope that my state and our consumers are OK with paying.”

Wyoming residents are just beginning to get a sense of what that might cost.

Services such as Nvidia GeForce Now Google Stadia Amazon Luna PS Now and Xbox Cloud Gaming can be seen as viable alternatives – depending on your internet speed – to traditional local-based hardware.

What’s more cloud gaming enables devices such as Chromebooks or smartphones to run graphically intensive games that wouldn’t otherwise be possible. If you subscribe to the highest tier of Nvidia GeForce Now you can get the performance of an RTX 3080 – a GPU that costs thousands of dollars and continues to be hard to find due to demand and the global semiconductor crisis – on a device that costs less than a few hundred. That means you can enjoy games at resolutions of up to 4K and frame rates up to 120fps should your device support it.

TechRadar Gaming spoke to Nvidia Geforce Now’s vice president and general manager Phil Eisler about the future of the company’s cloud streaming service the challenges that remain and whether or not cloud gaming can replace consoles and gaming PCs once and for all.

Invisible barriers

Although cloud gaming can be considered to be more accessible than ever challenges remain. Eisler outlined the main hurdles that Nvidia GeForce Now has had to overcome and is still tackling today.

“Initially the challenge was just getting it to work reliably and to build a service that can scale to millions of members” says Eisler. “We have a great engineering team that created an architecture that scaled to 30 global data centers and supports millions of gaming sessions from a catalog of over 1000 games.

“Next we had challenges updating those games around the world. To alleviate that we created an automated patching system that detects game patches and distributes them around the world in under an hour.

“And finally there’s the challenge of providing a consistent smooth streaming experience with low latency to our members around the globe. The move from 30fps to 60fps and now to 120fps rendering and streaming solved the latency issue” Eisler explains. “Nvidia engineering continues to make improvements to our streaming protocol to manage hitches in network connections. And network connections keep getting better with more Fiber and DOCSIS internet service links and less ADSL. The increased performance of home-based routers has helped as well from 2.4GHz to 5.0GHz and WiFi-6.”

In terms of the biggest bottleneck for cloud gaming right now Eisler admits that latency is perhaps the most troublesome problem but technological solutions and network improvements are on the way.

“I’m excited about future network improvements like Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) that we are working on with 5G network and Low Latency DOCSIS (LLD) network provider” says Eisler. “These technologies will reduce cloud gaming latency even further and make our level of service more consistent.

“The original GRID beta in 2013 used Kepler GPUs at 720p and 30fps. In 2015 we launched GeForce Now using Pascal GPUs at 1080p and 60fps” Eisler continues. “And most recently we introduced the Ampere generation SuperPOD (RTX 3080) that streams up to 1440p and 120fps. Nvidia will always continue to lead the way in cloud gaming technology and performance.”

A stop-gap for the GPU shortage?

With the GPU shortage continuing to drag on and cards often selling for far above their recommended retail price Nvidia GeForce Now has ultimately benefited according to Eisler. However he stressed that Nvidia isn’t ignoring supply issues despite the service’s increase in popularity.

“There has been an uptick in subscribers"" says Eisler. ""Nvidia continues to work hard to improve the supply situation. In the meantime playing on GeForce Now can be a great solution for gamers waiting for a new card to arrive.”

However Nvidia GeForce Now isn’t a replacement for PS5 or a high-end gaming PC.

“We are not there yet but cloud gaming is a great alternative for those who can’t afford a new console or gaming PC or just want to play their games on other devices” Eisler admits. “Chromebooks and phones are now the fastest-growing client types on GeForce Now and this segment is quickly catching up to integrated graphics laptops and Macs.

“A GeForce gaming PC is always going to be the best machine for gamers by offering the lowest possible latency and highest resolution. So far GeForce Now has been extending the GeForce gaming experience to new machines and gamers: 80% of our sessions are hosted on machines that could not play the game locally.

“Cloud gaming is an opportunity to expand the gaming market by instantly making one billion underpowered PCs and other devices game-ready. It’s an opportunity to introduce hundreds of millions of people to PC gaming.”

Competition in the cloud

When it comes to the novelty of GeForce Now Eisler says that even though there are other competitors in the cloud gaming space like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Luna it’s the gamers that Nvidia is listening to and learning from.

“We spend more time learning from gamers. PC gamers have told us that they want to be able to play free-to-play games or the games that they already own on Steam Epic Uplay and Origin game stores” says Eisler. “And they want to play on all of their devices using GeForce rigs in the cloud. This simple formula has connected with gamers and set GeForce Now apart from other cloud gaming services.”

Eisler also says that Nvidia has plans to bring Nvidia GeForce Now to more devices and didn't rule out the Nintendo Switch if there’s demand.

“Yes based on member requests we started supporting smart TVs beginning with the latest LG TV models in December 2021. At CES in January we announced that we’re collaborating with Samsung to bring GeForce Now to its Smart TVs by adding the service to the Samsung Gaming Hub. We continue to evaluate other devices that our members are interested in.”

GeForce Now could also come to VR headsets in the future according to Eisler.

“Nvidia already has CloudXR technology that enterprises use today to stream VR from the cloud” says Eisler. “Now that the latest consumer VR headsets have become untethered and GeForce Now has the ability to render and stream at 120fps I believe that we have the building blocks in place where cloud VR will make sense in the future.”

Getting games approved for GeForce Now

Like Xbox Cloud Gaming not every game is available on GeForce Now. Eisler shared some insight into the process of getting games onto the service.

""GeForce Now is a great platform for publishers to distribute their games because we use standard PC builds that don’t require any extra work by publishers"" Eisler explains. ""It’s the only platform that doesn’t charge publishers any revenue share.

""Game publishers have access to a rapidly growing market of cloud gamers they couldn’t reach previously who can now play AAA games on older integrated laptops macOS computers Chromebooks and more devices. We are also opening up new regions with more access to GeForce PCs via the cloud such as Turkey and Brazil.

“The result is millions of games being purchased by gamers – from the stores publishers offer their games on – to play on GeForce Now. That continues to entice more publishers to offer their games on GeForce Now. Our member response has been terrific with many encouraging publishers to list their games. Over time we’ve grown a massive catalog of playable games and we expect to see even more great games on GeForce Now in the future.”

But can we expect any exclusive games to hit Nvidia GeForce Now in the future? Not according to Eisler.

""Our goal is to be an open platform that supports all PC games and therefore none of our publishing deals are exclusive"" says Eisler. ""Today many popular Free-to-Play games are only available in the cloud on GeForce Now like Fortnite League of Legends and Apex Legends. However this is because we focus on bringing the best PC games to the cloud and not because of any exclusive deals.""

The impact of 5G

One of the biggest boons to cloud gaming is the rollout of 5G. 5G can offer 10 times the speed of 4G and support more simultaneous connections. It's something that will take cloud gaming out of the home and become accessible almost anywhere.

""I’m very excited about the prospects of 5G and GeForce Now. 5G network service provides excellent bandwidth and low latency which we have been testing with our Korean partner LGU+ for two years. In Seoul you can even play GeForce Now on the subway and it works great!

""In America we have a partnership with AT&T to bundle 6-months of GeForce Now with 5G phones that really shows the benefits of a 5G phone.

""We’ve also been working to improve the native touch-to-cloud experience on GeForce Now. Earlier this year we started a beta test with Epic to add native touch controls to Fortnite on our GeForce Now cloud version. The results are fantastic with a very intuitive way to enjoy cloud games on your 5G mobile phone with touchscreen inputs. We plan to rinse and repeat with more games.""

Unlimited possibilities

So looking into the future what are the biggest improvements we can expect to see in cloud gaming in the coming years?

“More Devices. More Games. More consistent quality of service. More links to launch cloud gaming from anywhere” says Eisler. “Games that scale better from 6” to 60” screens. Cloud-native games that only run in the cloud and are designed to leverage the full power of the SuperPODs that we’re building. The future of cloud gaming is only limited by our imagination.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2hhcy1udmlkaWEtcnVuZy10aGUtd2FybmluZy1iZWxscy1mb3ItdXBjb21pbmctZ3B1LXByaWNlLWNyYXNoL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2hhcy1udmlkaWEtcnVuZy10aGUtd2FybmluZy1iZWxscy1mb3ItdXBjb21pbmctZ3B1LXByaWNlLWNyYXNoL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Has NVIDIA Rung The Warning Bells For Upcoming GPU Price Crash?,"This is not investment advice.

Chip designer NVIDIA Corporation has revealed that its graphics processing unit (GPU) inventory stabilized during the previous quarter. The statements were made by NVIDIA's chief financial officer (CFO) Ms. Colette Kress during NVIDIA's investor call for its earnings release for its first quarter of the fiscal year 2023 during which the company managed to strongly grow its revenues and increase its earnings from the crucial data center segment as well. As part of the commentary released prior to the call the executive also explained that her company's inventory costs had grown in the quarter as it navigated a tricky supply chain and semiconductor environment in the wake of pandemic-induced disruptions.

NVIDIA CFO Expects GPU Inventory To Remain Stable During This Quarter

The first fiscal quarter saw NVIDIA increase its revenue by an impressive 46% annually to stand at $8.3 billion which marked a new overall record alongside all time highs for the company's gaming and data center segments.

NVIDIA's results also provided key details about the current state of the semiconductor and GPU market which has had to recently contend not only with dissatisfied gamers being unable to get their hands on the latest products but also with the wild swings in the cryptocurrency market.

These reveal that as far as gamers are concerned the inventory situation can stabilize during the current quarter. While Ms. Kress's comments as part of the earnings release did not specifically mention channel inventories she did share important details during her analyst session.

Prior to the call the earnings release outlined that NVIDIA had to deal with longer lead times in its supply chains. Lead time in the business world refers to the time taken for inventory to arrive at a company after it has placed an order and the CFO explained that her company's long term purchase obligations more than doubled annually as a result of the time increase. Supply uncertainty and shortage often cause companies to order higher quantities at higher rates but these decisions carry the risk of an oversupply that results in excess inventory.

Keeping these facts in mind Ms. Kress's comments during the analyst call were telling as she explained that NVIDIA is witnessing stability in channel inventory. Channel inventory refers to the products that are available with NVIDIA's retail partners but have not been sold to consumers.

During the call the executive explained that:

Channel inventory has nearly normalized and we expect it to remain around these levels in Q2. The extent in which cryptocurrency mining contributed to Gaming demand is difficult for us to quantify with any reasonable degree of precision.

These statements build upon her earlier comments and several reports that have consistently surfaced throughout the course of this year. For instance Ms. Kress outlined in January that she expects supply shortages to ease out by the second half of this year. At the same time she was also careful to mention that the demand for her GeForce products remained strong; a factor that will become important as you read below.

Another report from Australia that came to light in March revealed that some NVIDIA GPUs saw their prices drop by as much as 35% indicating that retailers were eager to sell them potentially due to an oversupply.

When taken together it just might turn out to be that in its eagerness to meet market demand and minimize shortage costs NVIDIA has ordered excess GPUs and sent them to its channel partners. Combined with the fact that the company's next generation RTX 40 GPUs might hit the market later this year the risk of an oversupply in the market that results in excess inventory is present.

Additionally if the high demand for its products experienced over the past couple of months resulted in NVIDIA increasing its shipments then the risk of the excess products remaining unsold might also materialize. Unable to get their hands on the GPUs the company's potential customers can have switched to alternatives or decided to wait for newer products but since the inventory has been updated to reflect the increased demand the drop in interest is another factor that can contribute to an oversupply. This is compounded by the fact that newer products such as those mentioned above have been rumored to launch either this year or the next.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHA6Ly93d3cub3B0aWNhLW9wbi5vcmcvaG9tZS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDIyL21heS9heWFyX2xhYnNfYmV0c19vbl9vcHRpY2FsX2lfb19mb3JfbmV4dC1nZW5fY29tcHV0aS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ayar Labs Bets on Optical I/O for Next-Gen Computing,"As the dreams of artificial intelligence and machine-learning system developers have grown ever larger the suppliers of hardware to enable those systems have started to bump up against some fundamental constraints. For example Nvidia—a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) that do the heavy lifting for a wide range of computationally intense systems such as those in AI—believes that by 2023 advanced AI models could entail 100 trillion or more connections rivaling the number of synapses in the human brain.

Those kinds of numbers which far outstrip what can be handled a single processor will require massive amounts of data to flow rapidly from one application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to another within data centers. Much of that chip-to-chip communication still takes place via copper interconnects in the electrical domain. And shunting around those immense data volumes will consume large perhaps cost-prohibitive amounts of power.

One company seeking to help solve that problem is the Silicon Valley-based Ayar Labs which is developing a line of CMOS-friendly low-power optical input/output (I/O) products to feed the market for interconnects in high-performance computing and AI. Nvidia seems to find the approach promising. On 25 May Ayar and Nvidia announced that they were collaborating on “integrating Ayar Labs’ technology to develop scale-out architectures enabled by high-bandwidth low-latency and ultra-low-power optical-based interconnects for future Nvidia products.”

A focus on the interconnects

A number of early-stage and startup companies are working to carve out a place for photonics in aspects of AI and high-performance computing. Some such as Lightelligence and Lightmatter are developing “AI accelerator” chips—intricate next-gen photonic integrated circuits that tackle entirely in the optical domain the power-hungry repeated matrix multiplications required by AI computing. But Mark Wade an Ayar Labs cofounder and the firm’s CTO stresses that’s not what his company is about.

“It’s an important distinction to say that we are not doing that” he told OPN. Instead of optical computing according to Wade Ayar focuses on “optically enabled computing”—and in particular on solving the bandwidth–distance bottleneck increasingly faced by traditional computer architectures relying on electronic host ASICs.

As computing demands have mushroomed Wade says “the trend has been that these ASICs have been trying to move more and more bandwidth between different packages.” And while a lot of the communication within data centers happens in the optical domain much of the package-to-package communication is still done electrically along copper interconnects. That sets up a trade-off: The more copper and the greater the I/O distance in the electrical domain the less bandwidth can flow from chip to chip with sufficiently low latency and power requirements.

TeraPHY and SuperNova

Ayar Labs aims to break that bottleneck Wade says through “a new class of photonic integration and technologies and products” that “really push the electrical-to-optical conversion as close to the host ASIC as possible.”

One element of this is an optical I/O “chiplet” called TeraPHY (yes it’s pronounced “terrify”). The chiplet is designed to be flip-chip bonded to the same substrate as an ASIC (such as an Nvidia GPU) and sit directly next to it. Data-carrying light is fed via a ribbon of single-mode fiber connections into (or out of) the chiplet where a system of microring resonators decodes the light signal into an electrical one (or vice versa).

“The whole point” says Wade “is to take the high bandwidth coming out of the host SoC [system on chip] convert it to the optical domain as fast as possible and then have a much more scalable way to move massive amounts of bandwidth with low energy [over] long distances.” And he adds the level of miniaturization and integration enabled by the microring-resonator architecture enables the optical-to-electrical/electrical-to-optical conversion to happen “at a starting point that’s much denser and ultimately much more energy efficient” than traditional products like pluggable transceivers that are aimed at the more mature optical-communications market.

The other core component of Ayar’s system is the company’s SuperNova laser light source which sits on a different chip and can produce 16 wavelengths of light delivered into 16 fibers (each of which can itself carry up to 16 wavelengths). This disaggregates the light source from the ASIC package which the company believes affords more flexible deployment across applications and easier replaceability of parts in the field.

“Massive” market opportunity

The partnership with Nvidia is only one of a flurry of announcements that have come from Ayar Labs in the past few months. An earlier announcement in February 2022 unveiled a strategic collaboration between Ayar and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to develop “silicon photonics solutions based on optical I/O technology.”

Subsequently in late April Ayar Labs reported that it had snagged US$130 million in Series C funding from an investor group that included HPE Nvidia Intel Global Foundries and a variety of venture-capital partners. That chunk of cash Wade told OPN will be used for “maturing our commercial operations our manufacturing and supply-chain operations our qualification cycles and really setting the stage to build a company that can deliver millions of these parts to multiple market segments.”

This year the numbers will be smaller; Ayar Labs expects to ship thousands of units to early-stage customers in 2022. “That’s not yet massive volume” Wade acknowledges. “But our ability to deliver thousands of units sets the stage for how we plan to scale into the future.”

And Wade—who has been “working on this technology for more than a decade now and working on commercializing it in our labs for the last five or six years”—firmly believes that the demand will be there.

“This solution that we’re building is not a niche solution that’s targeting one market segment” he maintains. “It’s actually going to be a ubiquitous problem that that multiple market segments and customers start facing. And we think the overall market opportunity there as we go into the middle and second half of this decade is truly massive.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtYmVkZGVkLmNvbS9lbWJlZGRlZC1uZXdzLWZpcnN0LWRlbW8tb2YtYXJtLWNvcnRleC1tODUtYXV0b21vdGl2ZS1pbXUtd2l0aC1tbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,embedded news: first demo of Arm Cortex-M85 automotive IMU with ML,"Advertisement

Renesas Electronics is to present the first live demonstration of a MCU based on the recently announced Arm Cortex-M85 processor at Embedded World 2022 in Nuremburg Germany from June 21-23. The Arm Cortex-M85 processor features Helium technology Arm’s M-Profile Vector Extension that enables advanced DSP/ML capabilities and helps accelerate compute intensive applications such as endpoint AI. Renesas is developing a new series of RA MCUs based on the Cortex-M85 processor planned for release in 2023. The new RA devices will bridge the gap between MCUs and MPUs enabling complex and compute-intensive applications with the lower power consumption and ease of use of an MCU.

STMicroelectronics has released the ASM330LHHX inertial measurement unit (IMU) which it said is the first automotive IMU with an embedded machine learning (ML) core.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 will be the next-generation high-end gaming graphics card offering the latest graphics architecture based on Ada Lovelace GPUs. The graphics card will be replacing the RTX 3070 a very popular gaming graphics card in the $500-$600 US segment.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Card - Purely Designed For Enthusiast Gamers

[Updated- 04/09/22]

While there's no denying the enthusiasm around the higher-end GeForce RTX 4090 & GeForce RTX 4080 series graphics cards that offer the best of the best gaming performance the RTX 4070 series graphics cards will be designed around the $500 US segment which is a high-end price range that still offers lots of performance at hand. It's simple the RTX 4090 series will be aimed at users who want the best of the best without worrying about the amount of money they are spending while the RTX 4080 series is aimed at users who want the best gaming performance at the best possible price. The RTX 4070 will be the sweet spot for high-end gaming offering a buttery smooth 2K game experience.

The previous GeForce RTX 3070 was touted to offer a huge improvement over the RTX 2070 and was said to offer performance faster than the RTX 2080 Ti but ended up mostly on par with the Turing flagship with only the RTX 3070 Ti exceeding the performance of the previous Turing GPU flagship. It looks like the RTX 4070 will be placed in a similar position where it might offer graphics performance on par or close to the RTX 3080 Ti but a 'Ti' variant going further ahead in graphics performance.

We should expect similar things with the next-generation gaming solution too but an important factor to consider is that GPUs are becoming more power-hungry and more pricey. It is a trend that might continue into the future as we get better products but in return there's always a cost to pay for end consumers. So starting with what we know so far first we should take a look at the brand new Ada Lovelace or AD10* class GPUs that will be powering the next-gen GeForce RTX 40 series cards.

You can also read the expected specs prices and performance of other upcoming RTX 40 GPUs in the posts below:

NVIDIA's AD104 'Ada Lovelace' GPU - The Next-Gen Powerhouse

Starting with the GPU configuration the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 series graphics cards are said to utilize the AD104 GPU core. The GPU is said to measure around 300mm2 and will utilize the TSMC 4N process node which is an optimized version of TSMC's 5nm (N5) node designed for the green team.

The NVIDIA Ada Lovelace AD104 GPU is expected to feature up to 5 GPC (Graphics Processing Clusters). This is the one less GPC than the GA104 GPU. Each GPU will consist of 6 TPCs and 2 SMs which is the same configuration as the existing chip. Each SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) will house four sub-cores which is also the same as the GA102 GPU. What's changed is the FP32 & the INT32 core configuration. Each sub-core will include 128 FP32 units but combined FP32+INT32 units will go up to 192. This is because the FP32 units don't share the same sub-core as the IN32 units. The 128 FP32 cores are separate from the 64 INT32 cores.

So in total each sub-core will consist of 32 FP32 plus 16 INT32 units for a total of 48 units. Each SM will have a total of 128 FP32 units plus 64 INT32 units for a total of 192 units. And since there are a total of 60 SM units (12 per GPC) we are looking at 7680 FP32 Units and 3840 INT32 units for a total of 11520 cores. Each SM will also include two Wrap Schedules (32 thread/CLK) for 64 wraps per SM. This is a 50% increase on the cores (FP32+INT32) and a 33% increase in Wraps/Threads vs the GA102 GPU.

Moving over to the cache this is another segment where NVIDIA has given a big boost over the existing Ampere GPUs. The Ada Lovelace GPUs will pack 192 KB of L1 cache per SM an increase of 50% over Ampere. That's a total of 2 MB of L1 cache on the top AD104 GPU. The L2 cache will be increased to 48 MB as mentioned in the leaks. This is a 12x increase over the Ampere GA104 GPU that hosts just 4 MB of L2 cache. The cache will be shared across the GPU.

Finally we have the ROPs which are also increased to 32 per GPC an increase of 2x over Ampere. You are looking at up to 160 ROPs versus just 96 on the GA104 Ampere GPU. There are also going to be the latest 4th Generation Tensor and 3rd Generation RT (Raytracing) cores infused on the Ada Lovelace GPUs which will help boost DLSS & Raytracing performance to the next level. Overall the Ada Lovelace AD103 GPU will offer:

5 GPCs vs 6 GPCs on GA104

+25% Cores vs GA104 GPU

50% More L1 Cache (Versus Ampere GA104)

Twice More L2 Cache (Versus Ampere GA104)

+66% ROPs (Versus Ampere GA104)

4th Gen Tensor & 3rd Gen RT Cores

Do note that clock speeds which are said to be between the 2-3 GHz range aren't taken into the equation so they will also play a major role in improving the per-core performance versus Ampere.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Specifications

As we saw with the GA104 GPU NVIDIA can have various configurations of the AD104 GPU for its GeForce RTX 4070 series lineup. We realistically expect there to be two variants the RTX 4070 and the RTX 4070 Ti. The former will be part of the initial lineup while the latter would launch as a mid-cycle refresh. The most entry-level GeForce RTX 30 had 23% fewer cores compared to the full chip but this time the '80-class' graphics cards are going to be powered by their own chip rather than relying on the AD102 GPU that the flagships use. As such we can expect anywhere from 6144 to the full 7680 core configuration.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 'Expected' Specifications

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 is going to be a cut-down configuration with a slightly higher core count than the RTX 3070 TI (6144 cores) allowing some room for a 'Ti' variant in the future with the full-fat configuration. The core count is expected to be 7168 which means 56 of the 60 SMs will be enabled. The GPU will come packed with 48 MB of L2 cache and up to 160 ROPs which is simply insane.

The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range. The higher than usual clock speed bump comes from the fact that NVIDIA is making a two-node jump considering the Ampere GPUs with Samsung 8nm node was in reality a 10nm process node with some optimizations. NVIDIA is skipping 7nm and going straight for a 5nm node and not even the vanilla variant but an optimized version of it. With Pascal on the TSMC 16nm node NVIDIA delivered a huge frequency leap and we can expect a similar jump this time around too.

As for memory specs the GeForce RTX 4070 is expected to rock 10 GB GDDR6 capacities that are said to be clocked at 18 Gbps speeds across a 160-bit bus interface. The card may rock a TBP of 300W and the leaker also mentions that the pricing of this card would not be lower than the RTX 3070 or 3070 Ti graphics cards. Simply put we can expect a price bump in the '70' class graphics segment.

As for its feature set the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics cards will rock all the modern NV feature sets such as the latest 4th Gen Tensor Cores 3rd gen RT cores and the latest NVENC Encoder and NVCDEC Decoder and support for the latest APIs. They will pack all the modern RTX features such as DLSS Reflex Broadcast Resizable-BAR Freestyle Ansel Highlights Shadowplay and G-SYNC support too.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Performance

As for the performance of the gaming GPUs we can only use theoretical numbers here since the launch is a bit far away but based on what we know the RTX 40 series cards might be the first gaming cards to hit the 100 TFLOPs compute horsepower limit.

Just for comparison's sake:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti: ~103 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)

~103 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090: ~90 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)

~90 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080: ~50 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)

~50 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 40 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.86 GHz Boost clock)

40 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.86 GHz Boost clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti: ~38 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)

~38 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070: ~36 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)

~36 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: 36 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.69 GHz Boost clock)

36 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.69 GHz Boost clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080: 30 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.71 GHz Boost clock)

30 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.71 GHz Boost clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti: 22 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock)

22 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: 20 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.72 GHz Boost clock)

Based on a theoretical clock speed of 2.5 GHz you get up to 36 TFLOPs of compute performance and the rumors are suggesting even higher boost clocks. Now these are definitely sounding like peak clocks similar to AMD's peak frequencies which are higher than the average 'Game' clock. A 36+ TFLOPs compute performance means more performance on a '70-class' GPU than an '80-class flagship' which will be a good bump. But one should keep in mind that compute performance doesn't necessarily indicate the overall gaming performance.

FP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better) Compute Power 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 RTX 4090 Ti (Theoretical) 100 RTX 4090 (Theoretical) 90 RTX 4080 (Theoretical) 50 RTX 3090 Ti 40 RTX 4070 Ti 38 RTX 4070 36 RTX 3090 36 RTX 3080 30 RX 6900 XTX 25 RTX 3070 Ti 22 RTX 3070 20 Xbox Series X 12 PlayStation 5 10

This will be around a 80% compute performance uplift for the GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card versus its predecessor and this is without even factoring in the RT and Tensor core performance which is expected to get major lifts too in their respective department. Now FLOPs aren't necessarily reflective of the graphics or gaming performance but they do provide a metric that can be used for comparison.

Gamers should expect 2K gaming to be buttery smooth on these graphics cards and with DLSS we might even see playable 60 FPS at 4K resolution with DLSS enabled. But to be realistic 1440p game titles would be the sweet spot for this graphics card.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Price & Availability

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 was launched at $499 US but its refreshes have really messed up the prices. The RTX 3070 Ti launched at $599 US a $100 US premium over the standard model but not offering a big enough performance boost to make the extra $ worth it.

NVIDIA really needs to secure more gamers in the $500 US segment but they have to deliver a product that's worth the price. The RTX 2070 and RTX 3070 were a little underwhelming & while they did manage to close the gap with the previous-gen flagship they still couldn't recapture the glory of the GTX 1070 which was a good bit ahead of the flagship Titan's that preceded it or the absolutely amazing price point of the GTX 970. With the performance leaps that are expected from the Ada Lovelace architecture the RTX 4070 has the potential to become one stellar graphics card option in the $500 US price range. Also if NVIDIA can simply ignore the refresh and give us a full-fat GA104 configuration at the $500 price point that would be an insane value and one of the best graphics card in its class for some time to come.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards are rumored for a mid-July reveal and a launch is expected in Q3 2022 so we will know for sure what NVIDIA is up to in the next few months.

Kenosha County Executive Samantha Kerkman tapped the keg at the Biergarten located in the county’s Petrifying Springs Park at 5555 Seventh St. in Somers.

“We’re excited to be here and be part of this” Kerkman said. “It’s in it’s sixth year and hopefully it will be successful because it’s a good partnership between the county and private business.”

The Rev. Eirik Olsen of Light of Christ Church in Kenosha offered a brief prayer at the event. He said the Biergarten has been “such a blessing to me in the last few years.”

“I’ve drowned some sorrows here and I’ve had some of the best conversations I’ve ever had in this county right in this space” he said.

Olsen thanked God for the beverage.

“Lord bless this creature beer which by your kindness and power has been produced by the kernels of grain” he prayed. “And let it be a healthful drink for mankind. Grant whoever drinks it with thanksgiving to your holy name.”

Dozens of area residents — many of whom brought their four legged friends — also turned out for the event.

Jake McGhee Jockey International’s vice president and chief philanthropy officer said the Biergarten has quickly become a Kenosha tradition. He brought his family to Friday’s event.

“It’s fun and now my kid’s old enough to walk around and enjoy it too” McGhee said. “She stuck her hand in my beer. She’s definitely from Wisconsin.”

The Biergarten was established in 2017 with a public-private partnership between Kenosha County and Petrifying Springs Biergarten LLC.

As part of this arrangement a portion of the Biergarten’s revenue returns to the county to fund park improvements.

“These kinds of collaborations have really been successful” Kerkman said.

She also encouraged area residents to take a stroll through some some of the county’s other parks.

“Come out and walk on a Saturday morning or bring the kids out” she added.

The Biergarten will be open from 4 to 9 p.m. daily each Monday through Thursday; noon to 9 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays; and noon to 8 p.m. Sundays.

In the fall of 2019 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hired a helicopter equipped with a leak-detecting infrared camera to criss-cross the Permian Basin looking for gaseous emissions part of a monitoring program undertaken at the behest of and in partnership with the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED). Over the course of nine days the EPA found leaking valves leaking hatches unlit and partially lit gas flares on wells leaking tank batteries and compressor stations. In all the flights documented 111 emissions at facilities run by 24 different oil and gas companies.

In 2020 the EPA did it again this time undertaking 15 days of flights and expanding their range to include part of the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico. They found 244 facilities emitting gases. At least one site had five separate emission sources. Then in March of this year the EPA issued consent agreements with 11 companies — some of the biggest producers in the country including Chevron ConocoPhillips and Occidental — for violations of the Clean Air Act based on the 2019 flights. Yet under those agreements two and a half years in the making only one company was fined for environmental violations despite the fact that all of the companies were cited for “directly releasing emissions to atmosphere.” The EPA fined another company for a paperwork violation.

Chisholm Energy (purchased by Earthstone Energy in December) operated three wells drilled without proper state permits and received a $162385 fine. All three wells had multiple leaks which were not noted in the settlement. BTA Oil Producers received a $75500 fine for operating two unregistered leaking wells. Based on estimates from the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division those wells produced oil and gas worth roughly $17 million for Chisholm and $30 million for BTA since they began production in 2018. The other 21 operators of leaking wells weren’t fined anything at all.

The Permian Basin where the majority of the flights took place isn’t much to look at. It’s 75000 square miles of mostly flat mostly treeless scrubland straddling the Texas-New Mexico border. This one-time ranchland is now the nation’s most productive oil and gas field with more than 38000 active wells and associated facilities just on the New Mexico side. But that wealth of resources comes at a cost. Recent studies show that Permian wells emit much more methane — a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO2 in its first 20 years in the atmosphere — than previously thought a finding backed up by new reporting requirements from the state’s Oil Conservation Division. Operators themselves are reporting dramatically more venting flaring and leaks than ever. And that’s on top of the unreported releases documented by the EPA flights.ere conducted in 2021.

All of these emissions fuel climate change which poses a deep and immediate threat to New Mexico. Massive forest fires supercharged by long-term aridification have charred more than a half-million acres across the state already this year months before the usual start of fire season. This includes the largest single fire in the state’s recorded history. The need for proper monitoring and crackdowns on violators could hardly be more pressing but the EPA has been slow in enforcement. Its recent consent agreements cover only what the agency found on the first round of flights. According to an EPA spokesperson the 2020 flights are still being assessed a year and a half after they concluded. No flights were conducted in 2021.

The EPA spokesperson also says that the agency can’t disclose the companies in the 2020 assessments because the investigations are ongoing. But a comparison of coordinates of the 2020 leaks provided by NMED with a list of the state’s oil and gas wells shows that 10 of the 11 companies cited in 2019 again had leaks in 2020 including Chisholm and BTA. Those leaks were sometimes at the exact same sites as shown in 2019 and 2020 videos of a site operated by Chisholm.

But it’s not clear what the EPA will do about what it found in 2020 — those flights happened before the EPA began notifying operators of the previous year’s violations.

It’s also not clear why the EPA didn’t fine companies for their violations of the Clean Air Act. After days of costly helicopter flights infrared camera rentals and more than two years of office and inspection work confirming that the companies had vented unknown amounts of methane and other gases into the atmosphere the EPA wrote to most of the companies: “Upon review EPA hereby confirms that you have completed all requirements … satisfactorily.”

No fines. No punishment. According to EPA documents the companies simply fixed the leaks and pledged not to do it again.

NMED Secretary James Kenney who requested the flights in the first place thinks that’s unlikely to happen.

“Unless there is significant deterrence there’s no change in behavior” he says. “And what you want to see from an enforcement program is a change in behavior.”

The above videos show EPA infrared footage of the same tank battery operated by Chisholm Energy in 2019 (top) and 2020. The black wispy clouds are escaping gases that led to the EPA’s Clean Air Act violation notice to the company.

* * *

Kenney asks to meet in person at NMED’s Albuquerque office to discuss the EPA flights. It’s a surprise he has the time: His agency is about to implement historic new clean car rules while simultaneously monitoring the environmental fallout of the colossal wildfires but he wants to be sure that NMED’s commitment to monitoring gaseous emissions is clear. Kenney is tall and rangy and he answers questions directly. The environmental engineer in him fills those replies with detailed background information and he taps the table when he’s making a point.

He also loves to talk about getting his hands dirty in his early years as an inspector. “I’ve climbed things gone under things grabbed samples of things” he says. “Had a shotgun pulled on me one day.”

At an oil site? “It was actually a dry cleaner” he says. “I probably should have just left but I stayed.”

Soon after New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took office in 2019 she hired Kenney to lead NMED. He had spent the previous 19 years working enforcement cases at the EPA often targeting the oil and gas industry in other parts of the country. Now the two wanted to undo eight years of neglect and chronic underfunding in the department by the previous administration of Republican Gov. Susana Martinez and then-NMED Secretary Ryan Flynn. The latter left his state office in 2016 to become the head of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association the state’s most prominent lobbying and interest group.

“It’s taken me three years to get to this point where I feel like we should have been in 2019” Kenney says. “We’re still cleaning up the prior administration’s problems.”

One of the first things he did was call a group with the resources and expertise to investigate some of the largest most powerful companies in the country: his former employer — the EPA.

“In the Martinez administration EPA wasn’t allowed in New Mexico” Kenney says. “In the Lujan Grisham administration the first thing we did is invite EPA in.”

Together the EPA and NMED set up what would become the 2019 and 2020 aerial programs to find leaks and emissions at oil and gas wells and other facilities and then prosecute offenders for violations they found. While Kenney won’t discuss details he says that the EPA’s toothless consent decrees don’t mean that prosecution is out of the question for offending companies. He says that NMED has several oil and gas producers on its prosecution radar based on the overflights and he hopes to be able to announce them by the end of this summer.

If that also seems even slower than the EPA that’s because it is.

Kenney takes pains to point out that while the feds have the money and staff to hire helicopters and track down systemic corporate offenders no one knows New Mexico wells and production better than the air quality inspectors in his office. Problem is Kenney has been able to keep only three of seven positions filled. Except for when someone quits and only two are filled. And there is only one lawyer to vet and write cases against offending oil and gas companies. In the last legislative session Kenney made waves as he fought for more positions and increased salaries for the people who keep an eye on the petroleum industry in the state — to little avail.

“We can’t deliver on everything given the budget that the Legislature gives us. We just can’t” Kenney says.

So when it comes to the state prosecuting fossil fuel operators “It’s dreadfully slow” he says.

And that’s why he invited the EPA to New Mexico. It has people money an ongoing oil and gas aerial monitoring program — and the ability to prosecute and fine companies that operate in violation of the Clean Air Act.

But to this point it hasn’t.

Of the 111 leaks from 24 companies that the EPA recorded that first year the agency acted on just 27 infractions by 11 companies.

When asked why Kenney said: Ask the EPA. “I’d be curious how they answer it.”

As of publication the EPA hasn’t answered.

* * *

Even some of the offending companies were expecting a penalty. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded companies to inform shareholders of impending legal matters and sizable fines and five of the 11 that received violation notices listed the EPA violations in their quarterly and annual SEC filings.

The wording differed from company to company but the gist of all was similar to what Marathon Oil told its shareholders in a quarterly financial report from September 2021. “In January 2020 we received a Notice of Violation from the EPA related to the Clean Air Act” the company reported. “However we believe that any penalties mitigation costs or corrective actions that may result from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows.”

According to the EPA website the agency could have assessed a penalty of up to $25000 a day up to a total of $200000 for each infraction with penalties doubled for subsequent convictions. That may seem like small potatoes to a large corporation but multiple violations can add up. Marathon Oil had to prepare its shareholders for that eventuality. But in the end the company suffered no adverse effects at all. Five months after issuing the notice of violation the EPA sent Marathon Oil a final notice closing its case without one dollar in fines.

Kayley Shoup knew about the EPA flights and as the Carlsbad-based director of Citizens Caring for the Future did her best to follow up on their findings. Over the past year she has traveled around the Permian Basin with field workers from the environmental group Earthworks looking at wells and facilities with their own infrared camera spotting emissions and reporting them to NMED. They used the EPA flight data to choose which wells to check among the tens of thousands in the region.

“We could check maybe four of those in a given day” she says. “And the ones that were emitting when [the EPA] flew over were still emitting.”

But Shoup didn’t know that the EPA had found leaks but closed most of the investigations without penalties.

“I’m not shocked” she says “but that’s horrifying.”

Last year the state developed new rules to reduce so-called ozone precursors — airborne chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOC) that contribute to ozone pollution and smog. The regulations which will likely receive their final approval and implementation from NMED’s governing board this month require producers to stop leaks of ozone-causing chemicals from oil and gas wells. The rules have the added effect of penalizing operators whose wells emit methane a fellow traveler of the ozone precursors.

The rules were triggered in part by seven New Mexico counties on an air pollution watchlist. They are within 95% of the maximum ozone level allowed by the EPA. Of those counties one contains a suburb of Albuquerque the state’s largest city and another contains Las Cruces the second-largest city. The other five counties encompass the state’s two oil and gas producing regions — including Eddy County where Shoup lives.

“Clearly this has impacts” she says. Shoup knows families with endocrine issues reproductive issues a family with a premature baby. As with so many diseases there are no definable single causes but “these people live basically right in the middle of the oil field” where the air smells of oil gas and other VOCs.

In light of this her group is trying to get indoor air purifiers that filter VOCs from people’s homes. She says it’s a new idea that will take a lot of time as well as money that people don’t have. “But you know we are trying to start it.”

Shoup talked just after driving down state highway 285 between Artesia and Carlsbad through one of the more productive — and destructive — regions of the Permian Basin. On the east side of the highway was a mature oilfield. On the other side companies are drilling new wells in a gas field and the air is banked in smog.

“It looks like Los Angeles” she says “but like 10 times worse and dusty and disgusting.”

* * *

Kenney is trying to fix that.

“It is excruciatingly painful to have the information the evidence the understanding of environmental impact the understanding that our ozone levels are getting worse the understanding that communities are affected” he says.

He says it slowly and carefully to drive the point home.

“I know how to do this and my only Achilles heel is resources right now” Kenney says. “We don’t have the resources to be the regulator that people expect us to be.”

His department is trying out new technology that can do the work of several on-the-ground inspectors. He talks of working with Sceye to deploy High-Altitude Platform Stations (aka automated blimps) to monitor methane and other leaks in the state’s oil and gas fields in unprecedented detail and in real time. He also says NMED recently tested a car outfitted with a sniffer that can immediately detect methane and other VOCs in the surrounding air. But the systems aren’t deployed yet.

“I am very clear about my role on enforcement and it’s shaped by 20-plus years of working these cases” Kenney says.

“I am not just making shit up” he says tapping the table. “I have a plan.”

Part of that plan is continuing to work with the EPA — and continuing to press for enforcement. The agency conducted another round of monitoring flights earlier this year. Details of those flights are not yet available even to Kenney. Again he suggests asking the EPA.

The EPA didn’t respond to questions about the 2022 flight program — nor to questions about the pace of prosecutions why so few companies were singled out for violation letters or why companies weren’t fined for violating the Clean Air Act one of the agency’s signature duties. Since the federal overflight program began New Mexico has implemented tougher oil and gas emission regulations but without a parallel increase in enforcement staffing. It’s not clear if additional federal monitoring will effectively fill the gap.

In late April the EPA did send out its first two violation letters from the 2020 flights. One went to Murchison Oil and Gas for a pair of leaking wells. The other went to Occidental Petroleum which received a notice in 2019 for a leaking valve on a tank battery. In 2020 the new letter reveals the EPA found leaks at nine Occidental sites including multiple leaks at the same tank battery. To date the EPA has not issued any fines to Occidental for those emissions.

Correction: This story originally twice referred to 23 companies that with leaks that were sighted as part of the 2019 set of flights. The number is 24. We regret the error.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1ib3VnaHQtbmVhcmx5LTUtMTEwMDAwNzY0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett bought nearly $5 billion worth of HP shares ⁠— here's why you might want to ride his coattails,"Warren Buffett bought nearly $5 billion worth of HP shares ⁠— here's why you might want to ride his coattails

Warren Buffett isn’t known for being a technology investor.

In his 2014 letter to shareholders Buffett wrote that he prefers “simple businesses” and added that “if there’s lots of technology we won’t understand it.”

But in recent years the Oracle of Omaha has warmed up a bit to the tech space. His holding company Berkshire Hathaway started buying Apple in 2016. Now the iPhone giant is the largest public holding in its portfolio.

Just last month Berkshire revealed that it had purchased 121 million shares of PC and printer hardware company HP (HPQ) a stake worth nearly $4.7 billion at today’s prices.

Let’s quickly dig into the move and figure out if following Buffett into HP makes sense for investors.

An unexpected shopping spree

Berkshire’s cash pile grew to a near-record $146.7 billion at the end of 2021 largely because Buffett found little that excited him. He is a value investor after all and U.S. stock market valuations were bloated up until a few months ago.

But based on his company’s recent moves it's clear that Buffett now sees opportunity in the market.

In March Berkshire snapped up over 136 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY) representing nearly 15% of the integrated oil and gas giant’s total shares outstanding.

Later in the month Berkshire reached an agreement to buy insurance company Alleghany for $11.6 billion.

And now by loading up 121 million shares of HP Berkshire has become its largest shareholder with an 11.4% stake.

A fast-growing company

With a market cap of around $41 billion HP isn’t nearly as big as Buffett’s other major tech holding Apple. But it’s one of the leading players in the PC industry.

And business is not standing still.

In HP’s fiscal Q1 revenue grew 8.8% year over year to $17 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.10 up 19.6% from the year-ago period and well above management’s prior outlook.

In March HP announced that it would acquire video and voice solutions company Poly in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.3 billion. The move should accelerate HP’s growth strategy helping it build a leading portfolio of hybrid work solutions.

The company is returning cash to investors too. HP pays quarterly dividends of 25 cents per share translating to a decent annual yield of 2.6%.

It’s also buying back its shares: In fiscal Q1 HP spent $1.5 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 42.6 million shares of common stock.

Buffett loves cheap stocks

Due to growing investor interest many tech stocks have rallied significantly in recent years pushing their valuations to uncomfortably high levels.

Story continues

However HP remains relatively cheap a characteristic that Buffett loves to see in his investment purchases.

Despite the multi-year rally in tech HP has a price-to-earnings ratio of 7. That’s not only substantially lower than the S&P 500’s average P/E of 21 but also below the company’s own five-year average P/E of 10.

Given Wall Street’s positive reaction to the investment — both HP and Berkshire shares are up nicely since the announcement — following Buffett’s coattails might not be a bad idea.

“We view Berkshire buying HPQ shares as a positive that validates HPQ’s strategy/deep value” writes Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani in a note to investors.

But it was early enough the Bulldogs had plenty of time to battle out of a 2-0 and 6-1 holes. They tied the game 6-6 in the eighth inning on a solo home run by Taylor Young. But ODU (40-16) scored three runs in the 13th inning to come away with a 9-6 win Saturday in the Conference USA Tournament.

It's unclear if the loss damages Louisiana Tech's chances of making the NCAA Tournament with an at-large berth if it doesn't get the automatic bid by winning the conference tournament.

Louisiana Tech’s loss means it will face ODU again Saturday in an elimination game which will begin approximately 45 minutes after the conclusion of the Southern Miss-UTSA game. The winner will face either Southern Miss or UTSA at 2 p.m. Sunday in the championship game.

It will be the third time the two teams have played in the tournament. The Bulldogs won 7-2 on Thursday.

The Bulldogs (40-19) got a run back in the first inning and scored three more runs in the third to cut its deficit to 6-4 but left the bases loaded in both the third and fourth innings.

HATTIESBURG Miss. – With a pitching staff patched together with spit and gum and exhausted from playing five games in four days the Old Dominion baseball team was playing on fumes and yet took Louisiana Tech down to the game's final play.



The Monarchs staged an 9th-inning rally taking a 7-6 lead on a Brock Gagliardi two-run home run his second of the game and were two outs away from beating the Bulldogs and claiming a berth in the Conference USA championship game.



But pinch-hitter Walker Burchfield shot a dagger into ODU's hearts drilling a two-run single to left field that scored two runs and gave LA Tech an 8-7 victory Saturday night at Pete Taylor Park.



The game was a rematch of last year's C-USA championship game which ODU won 7-5 in 10 innings in Ruston Louisiana.



LA Tech (41-19) advances to Sunday's 2 p.m. championship game in which the Bulldogs will take on UTSA for the C-USA title.



ODU (41-17) meanwhile awaits what coach Chris Finwood says surely will be an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.



""We've got baseball left to play"" he said. ""Our season's not over.



""These guys deserve to keep playing and they will.""



National prognosticators had ODU on the bubble entering Saturday. The Monarchs opened the day by beating LA Tech 9-6 in 13 innings in a classic game in which Andy Garriola drove in the game-winning run and relief pitcher Jason Hartline threw 3 2/3 scoreless innings.



Saturday night's game was also a back-and-forth affair in which both teams walked an emotional tightrope. The Monarchs celebrated wildly after Gagliardi's second home run the first two homer game of his career then looked in stunned silence as LA Tech players celebrating by jumping into a pile on first base.



D1Baseball had the Monarchs as the last team out of the NCAA Tournament on Saturday morning but had Alabama in the tournament and the Crimson Tide was eliminated from the SEC Tournament by Florida a game D1Baseball writers called ""crucial"" to Alabama's hopes of gaining an at-large bid.



But Gonzaga and Dallas Baptist which ranked among the top 30 in the RPI both lost in their conference tournaments meaning teams that weren't expected to go to the NCAA Tournament will gain automatic bids.



According to warrennolan.com ODU moved up three places on Saturday in the NCAA RPI to 42nd. Finwood said winning 41 games in the nation's fifth toughest conference warrants a bid.



ODU also has a ton of momentum -- the Monarchs won 10 of their last 12 games with both losses coming to LA Tech which is No. 37 in the RPI.



ODU swept two games from East Carolina which plays for the American Athletic Conference title Sunday and may host an NCAA Regional as well as a victory at Virginia and two wins at Southern Miss.



The Monarchs bus back to Norfolk on Sunday and hope to be able to gather to watch the NCAA Tournament show at noon Monday on ESPN2.



""l'll be on the phone with people as will our administration"" Finwood said.



Saturday's game was ODU's final event ever in Conference USA. The Monarchs join the Sun Belt Conference along with Southern Miss Marshall and James Madison on July 1.



Finwood said Athletic Director Dr. Wood Selig will also work the phones.



""We want to make sure all the committee members know what we've done this year"" he said. ""I know people on the committee and they need to know how much we deserve to be in.



""At the end of the day it's people in there and they're voting. Your metrics are your metrics and ours are awfully good. But you still have to be careful.""



LA Tech took a quick 2-0 lead in the first inning. Leadoff hitter Taylor Young began the game with a bunt single followed two batters later by a walk to Steele Netterville. Cole McConnell then singled to right to score Taylor and then Jorge Corona hit a sacrifice fly to right field that scored Netterville.



ODU's bats then came alive in the fourth when the top of the lineup pounded out four hits for four runs.



Thomas Wheeler hit a triple down the right field line and then wheeled home on a throwing error. Matt Coutney then doubled and was driven home by a double from Garriola.



Gagliardi then drove a line drive home run to the opposite field off a billboard in left field to make it 4-2.



LA Tech tied it right back up in the bottom of the inning on a two-run double from Young.



LA Tech retook the lead in the sixth when Myers hit a sacrifice fly to right field to score Nettervile. But with runners on second and third reliever Joey DeChiaro forced McLeod to fly out stranding both runners.



Coutney then tied it up with a solo home run in the sixth bouncing the ball off the same billboard that Gagliardi hit earlier in the game.



ODU used nine pitchers in Saturday morning's victory over LA Tech. The Monarchs used seven against the Bulldogs including Connor Muly who made his first career start.



Tommy Gertner threw three strong innings in his second pitching effort of the day. DeChiaro also threw for the second time and was exceptional in 2 1/3 innings.



Yet things went badly for ODU in the bottom of the ninth when Monarch pitchers loaded the bases with two walks and then hit a batter.



Vincent Bashara then struck out Adarius Myers swinging but then Burchfield hit the shot to left field that broke the Monarchs' hearts. Garriola fielded the ball cleanly and made a valiant effort to throw out Netterville who scored the winning run just ahead of the throw.



The pain was still apparent in the faces of the Monarchs long after the game ended.



""It hurts because of a good thing"" Finwood said. ""It hurts because they care about each other because of how hard they fight for each other.



""Teams who lose at the end of the year and it doesn't hurt they don't get it. And these guys got it.



""I've never been prouder of a team than I've been today. I wish we had a couple more bullets to fire on the mound. But it is what it is. I thought the guys who pitched today pitched their butts off. We just didn't have enough of them.""

The source spoke on condition of anonymity because South Carolina has not provided an update on Kingston's job status. Kingston is under contract through 2025.

Kingston will return to USC after the Gamecocks suffered their first losing season since 1996 and missed the NCAA Tournament for the second time in the past three full seasons.

South Carolina was eliminated from the SEC Tournament with an extra-innings loss to Florida in Hoover on Tuesday night spurring speculation about Kingston's future.

USC key players:Five key South Carolina baseball players to watch during SEC Tournament 2022

NCAA projections:South Carolina baseball still playing for postseason berth as regular season enters final week

Kingston received a contract extension last summer. The new deal didn't raise his annual salary of $600000 but bumped his buyout back to $2.2 million a figure that could have played some part in Kingston's return. If USC had decided to move on from Kingston after June 30 his buyout would drop to $1.4 million.

Over the past two seasons USC has paid out more than $16 million in buyouts to former football coach Will Muschamp his football assistants and recently fired men's basketball coach Frank Martin.

In five seasons Kingston has gone 138-109 one of the lower winning percentages (.559) for a baseball coach at USC in recent memory.

History and tradition hails with South Carolina baseball a program just over a decade removed from capturing back-to-back national championships and playing for a third.

Kingston however hasn't lived up to that expectation. He has guided the Gamecocks to just one super regional two regional berths – one of those as an unintended host as a No. 2 seed in 2021 because Old Dominion's facilities weren't up to NCAA standard – and also missed missed NCAA Tournaments during his tenure.

South Carolina lost several key pitchers – nine in total – in 2022 because of injury including projected weekend starting pitchers Julian Bosnic and James Hicks. But it has been the offense where Kingston's coaching background lies that has left plenty to be desired. The team struggled to another losing SEC record this season at 13-17.

The Gamecocks ranked last in hitting in the SEC in 2022.

""We're all disappointed"" Kingston said following the close of South Carolina's season in Hoover. ""In my opinion the word 'context' is what matters most. When you factor in you had 10 pitchers throughout the course of the season that pitched very little or not at all and what kind of impact they would've had on our win-loss record.

""It handcuffed us. It just did.""

The report recognized Semiconductors as integral part of technology used in automobiles and its components electronics etc. Such disruption in the supply chain has adversely affected the production of cars that offer increasing integration of connected features infotainment and intelligent safety systems.

The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) quantified the impact of semiconductor shortage as it noted the domestic market slump to 17.51 million units in 2021-22; lowest since 2012-13 with almost similar numbers. Such a demand-supply gap has resulted in waiting timelines for aspiring buyers' dream cars ranging from 5-6 months to a year.

This trend of long waiting periods has caught on the patience of prospective customers who are turning to pre-owned cars. The rush for pre-owned cars on the other hand is making these cars dearer which is benefitting the previous owners who are getting reasonably higher resale values of their vehicles when compared to the global pre-lockdown period.

MG has caught the imagination of customers including those who have owned a luxury brand car. MG cars come as value for money machines as their owners have known to get industry best exchange & resale values ranging from 80% to 100% for their SUVs.

An owner of Hector Plus Sharp DCT in Bengaluru on selling his car realised a value of 96% after 9 months of ownership for the SUV which he purchased in the month of Dec. of year 2020 at Rs. 1849569. The car was further sold for Rs. 1760000 in August ’21.

Next is an owner of Hector Sharp DCT who got 92% value for the car after little less than 2 years of ownership of the car which he bought for Rs. 1735180. The SUV went for Rs. 1580000 in October last year.

Another Hector Smart MT got it’s customer almost 94% resale value in Oct. ’21 after 2 years of ownership and the car was sold for Rs. 1450000.

An earlier instance when a customer who had bought Hector Plus Diesel in Oct ’20; upgraded to Gloster 6 Savvy top trim. The transaction got him a resale value for his Hector Plus of 93.7% for the car after 6 months. He exchanged his Hector Plus at Rs. 17 lakhs.

In the process chip design will be democratized in line with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that – Design in India is as important as Make in India.

Understanding chip design as a strategic necessity a pilot deployment was successfully tested by MeitY earlier in 2021 under Special Manpower Development Programme for Chips to System Design (SMDP-C2SD) wherein a centralized design facility at C-DAC was enabled for remote access by over 50000 engineering students at 60 academic institutions for designing chips. Leapfrogging MeitY now intends to make accessible a centralized chip design infrastructure to be made available at India Chip Centre setup at C-DAC to train 85000+ B.Tech M.Tech and PhD students at 120 academic institutions across the country in chip design area for next 5 years.

For making available the chip design infrastructure at India Chip Centre (C-DAC) leading industry vendors from EDA (Electronic Design Automation) Electronic Computer-Aided Design (ECAD) IP Core and Design solutions Industry are being partnered with. Specific collaborative arrangements are being made available with Synopsys Cadence Design Systems Siemens EDA Silvaco & other leading tool vendors IP & design solution providers and Fab aggregators.

At centralized design facility hosted at India Chip Centre (C-DAC) not only the most advanced tools for entire chip design cycle (i.e. Front-end design Back-end design PCB design & analysis etc. for Digital Analog RF & Mixed Signal designs) going up to 7nm or advanced node but also an arrangement of instructor-led/ online trainings on design flows by industry professionals are being made available for next 5 years.

This centralized facility at India Chip Centre (C-DAC) one of the biggest of existing facilities offering plethora of design flows aims to bring the chip design infrastructure at door-steps of over 85000 students at 120 academic institutions. Taking advantage several academic start-ups will mushroom across the country cross the initial entry barriers and pave the way for entrepreneurship/ startup-led design & innovations ecosystem in the country making indigenous IP Cores Chips System on Chip (SoCs) Systems for different application areas like 5G/ IoT AI/ ML Automotive & Mobility sector etc. in India for the World.

As SemiconIndia 2022 concluded successfully last week most of the global semiconductor leaders (like Intel Micron Qualcomm LAM Research etc) not only highlighted the contribution of their Indian R&D centres which are now the biggest centres out of their headquarter locations but also acknowledged the semiconductor design strength in our country which now makes up for 20% of the world’s engineers.

Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw Minister for Electronics & Information Technology envisions making available a design talent pool of highly skilled engineers for turning India into a semiconductor hub through the Chips to Startup (C2S) Programme and other initiatives in Semiconductor policy. This will strengthen & supplement the Indian talent pool designing the leading-edge chips for semiconductor giants with complete ownership of some of these chips in the country. Speaking at SemiconIndia 2022 he highlighted that India’s democracy and talent pool sets it apart from other countries fighting for chip sovereignty.

Many co-development pacts were announced at SemiconIndia 2022 last week by Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar Minister of State for Electronics & Information Technology including Digital India RISC-V (DIR-V) Program aiming to catalyze India’s semiconductor ecosystem. These announcements coupled with the fact that India has just scored a century of Unicorns this week and the steps taken to democratize the chip design across the country shall trigger the next wave of Startups and unicorns from semiconductor design space in the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGJpa2UuY29tL25ld3Mvdm9sa3N3YWdlbi1jZW8tc2Vlcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXJlYm91bmQtMzAxNjg0NNIBVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGJpa2UuY29tL25ld3Mvdm9sa3N3YWdlbi1jZW8tc2Vlcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXJlYm91bmQtMzAxNjg0ND9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Volkswagen CEO Sees Production Rebound,"Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Herbert Diess said he sees ""clear improvement"" in semiconductor supplies and expects the automaker's global production can recover during the rest of this year.

Diess speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum conference in Davos Switzerland said disruptions to Volkswagen's supply chain in Ukraine are also easing. Russia's invasion of Ukraine temporarily halted production of wiring harnesses and other components used in Volkswagen vehicles.

""The situation from Ukraine is under control now if nothing bad really happens anymore we won't lose too many cars"" Diess said.

Diess and other senior Volkswagen executives covered a wide range of topics in a meeting with reporters.

Volkswagen plans to decide this year on a site in the United States to assemble its proposed Scout brand electric trucks and SUVs Diess said. The company is assessing ""brownfield sites and some greenfield locations"" he said using terms for existing manufacturing facilities and open fields where completely new factories could be built.

Volkswagen Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz said the company isn't ruling out an eventual share listing for the Scout brand but it is too soon for that now.

Scout is part of a broader effort by Volkswagen to expand its presence in the United States market not just for passenger vehicles but commercial vehicles as well Diess and other executives said.

Volkswagen plans to spend 7 billion euros over the next five years beefing up its U.S. product line including the addition of an electric pickup truck Antlitz said.

Diess said he is confident Volkswagen can secure enough batteries to supply its electric vehicle production through 2025 but he suggested some rivals could fall short.

""Are there enough batteries? Probably not. Are there as many batteries as we ordered? Yes for sure"" Diess said.

Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares warned yesterday that automakers could face a battery supply crunch by 2024-2025.

Elon Musk the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla topped Fortune‘s new list of the most highly compensated CEOs on the Fortune 500. In 2021 Musk “realized” compensation worth almost $23.5 billion from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018 multiyear “moonshot” grant. That was—by far—the biggest CEO payday in 2021 according to our new analysis of how Fortune 500 CEOs are compensated.

After Musk the 10 most highly compensated Fortune 500 CEOs of 2021 are all tech and biotech CEOs including the heads of Apple Netflix and Microsoft. The full list is below.

CEO pay dwarfs that of the average employee. The average big-company CEO made 351 times the pay of the average worker on a realized basis in 2020 according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) which has tracked the metric for decades up from a 21-to-1 ratio back in 1965.

Our analysis evaluated the pay packages of 280 Fortune 500 CEOs who earned a median total compensation of $15.9 million up 30% from a year earlier. When calculating a CEO’s total realized pay we measured the following for the company’s most recent fiscal year: salary and bonuses; other compensation such as vested restricted stock grants long-term incentive payouts and perks; and stock gains in the form of value realized from exercising stock options. Because the value of unexercised options is unpredictable we did not consider them in our tabulation of total compensation.

Here are the highest-paid CEOs.

1. Elon Musk Tesla: $23.5 billion

Musk the founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla “realized” compensation worth almost $23.5 billion in 2021 from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018.

Tesla ranked 65 on this year’s Fortune 500. The company had a blockbuster 2021 bringing in $53.8 billion in revenue up 71% from 2020 and expanding significantly into key European and Chinese markets. Tesla delivered 936000 vehicles in 2021 an 87% increase that puts the company at the pinnacle of the global EV industry with a 14% market share.

Musk did not respond to Fortune‘s requests for comment.

2. Tim Cook Apple: $770.5 million

Cook has been CEO of Apple Inc. since 2011. He earned $770.5 million in 2021 alone mostly as a part of a 10-year grant of shares worth $1.7 billion. But his incredible pay package may be justified by Apple’s stock market performance under Cook: The tech company’s market value during his tenure has increased by $2.2 trillion.

Apple ranks 3 on the Fortune 500. The company faced challenges because of the global chip shortage but successfully began manufacturing the equipment in-house. Apple finished the year with a gargantuan $95 billion in profits—outperforming every other U.S. company on that front.

Apple declined to comment on Fortune‘s analysis.

3. Jensen Huang NVIDIA $561 million

Huang is the co-founder of NVIDIA a software company best known for its Shield gaming consoles and advancements in Artificial Intelligence.

The company ranked 134 on this year’s Fortune 500. Revenue surged 61.4%.

A spokesperson acknowledged that during the latest fiscal year Huang “realized about $507 million from expiring options that had been granted in 2011 and 2012 reflecting the approximately 60x increase in the company’s share price over the [past] decade.”

4. Reed Hastings Netflix: $453.5 million

Hastings is the co-founder CEO and chairman of the streaming giant. Under his leadership Netflix went from a DVD mail delivery service to an online streaming heavyweight.

Netflix ranked 115 on the Fortune 500 with an 18.8% change in revenue. The company has recently cut costs after losing subscribers as the world re-opens after the pandemic. Netflix also faces increased competition from streaming services.

A spokesperson disputed Fortune‘s analysis of Hastings’ realized pay and would only reiterate the total value of his “granted” compensation for 2021: “Per our proxy statement his compensation in 2021 was $40.8 million with $650000 in cash and $39.7 million in stock options.”

5. Leonard Schleifer Regeneron Pharmaceuticals: $452.9 million

Schleifer is the co-founder and CEO of Regeneron a biopharmaceutical company that makes a variety of medications that treat asthma cancer chronic pain and more.

The company ranked 231 on this year’s Fortune 500. Revenue rose 89.1% in 2021 driven by the company’s REGEN-COV antibody treatment for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

A spokesperson noted that the bulk of Schleifer’s realized pay per Fortune‘s analysis “reflects the exercise of long-held options that were reaching their ten-year expiration point” and said “Regeneron’s compensation philosophy has always emphasized long-term incentives in the form of stock options and other equity-based awards as we believe this aligns employee interests with the typically long-term nature of drug development.”

6. Marc Benioff Salesforce: $439.4 million

Benioff founded Salesforce in 1999 adopting the marketing slogan “The End of Software.” The cloud-based customer relationship management platform ranked 136 on this year’s Fortune 500.

Salesforce’s acquisitions of MuleSoft Tableau and Slack have helped fuel growth in recent years. Revenue rose 24.7% percent in 2021.

Salesforce did not respond to a request for comment.

7. Satya Nadella Microsoft: $309.4 million

Many of Nadella’s peers likely believe he deserves a huge payday. This year Nadella was voted the “most underrated” CEO for the sixth consecutive year according to the survey behind Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies. Nadella has headed that list since 2017.

Microsoft posted a robust 38% increase in profits last year—earning $61 billion the fourth-largest sum among Fortune 500 companies—as revenue rose 17.5% to $168 billion thanks to a successful Surface laptop and tablet launch. The company which ranked 14 on this year’s 500 also grappled with a chip shortage that challenged Xbox game consoles.

Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.

Kotick became CEO of Activision in 1991. The gaming giant best known for games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft ranked 396 on this year’s Fortune 500.

Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick earned $296.7 million last year according to our calculations from the value realized on vested restricted stock. Despite rampant employee complaints and several lawsuits over sexism harassment and Kotick’s personal mismanagement of assault claims at the game developer Microsoft in January agreed to buy Activision for $68.7 billion in what would be its largest acquisition to date.

In an emailed statement a spokesperson reiterated that Activision Blizzard had valued Kotick’s “granted” (but not realized) compensation in 2021 at $826549. She noted that Kotick had reduced his salary to $62500 last year and praised his 31-year tenure for making Activision “one of the most successful global gaming com- panies in the world.”

The English Premier League club sold for $5 billion and there was no shortage of suitors. That should make Portland Trail Blazers’ fans sleep better in the coming months as a sale of the team is inevitable.

After owner Paul Allen passed away his sister Jody has assumed the role of owner and it’s meant to only be temporary according to John Canzano. The longtime Pacific Northwest sports writer said of Allen’s two sports franchises — the Blazers and the Seattle Seahawks — Rip City is likely to be sold first with the Hawks following soon after.

Advertisement

The good news for the people of Rose City who are worried about a new owner moving the team north a few hours to Seattle is that possibility is a “no go” per a sitting team president of an NBA franchise. There’s been rumors of expansion teams coming to Seattle and Las Vegas and the lucrative fees that come with them.

Of the three potential bidders that Canzano floated two of them are high-profile women with MacKenzie Scott (Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife) and Laurene Powell-Jobs (widow of Steve Jobs) showing interest.

Oracle Corporation co-founder Larry Ellison who bid for and lost out on attempts to purchase the Warriors Pelicans and Grizzlies also is in the mix. In addition to those names the groups who come up short in their attempt to purchase the Denver Broncos could throw their billions into the ring because speculation is the people overseeing the auction of Mile High’s favorite franchise will conduct the sale of the Blazers as well.

The vice chair of the Blazers Bert Kolde is in charge of the transaction and is paying close attention to what the Broncos fetch. Valued at $1.7 billion when Allen died Kolde’s ideal price for a sale is in the range of $3 billion.

All of that adds up to a tremendous amount of money in the banana stand. As a Blazer diehard my choice would be between Scott and Powell-Jobs because sports needs another old white male owner like the NFL NBA NHL and EPL needs another Stan Kroenke.

The most high-profile female owners in professional sports are Lakers’ owner Jeannie Buss Detroit Lions’ owner Sheila Ford Hamp New Orleans Saints and Pelicans’ owner Gayle Benson and I guess Jody Allen who is soon to be a former owner. (Canzano mentioned an unsubstantiated rumor that Allen might be trying to keep a piece of the Seahawks so there’s a universe where she could still be involved in the ownership of a sports franchise.)

Advertisement

There’s no guarantee that Scott or Powell-Jobs would be successful as owners because it’s an incredibly hard undertaking. The Lakers won a title under Buss but haven’t done much right since except for hiring Darvin Ham. The Lions have had some good offseason clippings and hopefully that leads to in-season success. (I remain skeptical until I see it though. Not because of Ford; more because they’re the Lions.) And the New Orleans franchises under Benson have been great to encouraging first-round exit . The recent Saints’ run was the best in franchise history and the Pelicans were able to turn around their season despite whatever is up with Zi on Williamson and the city’s apathetic approach to NBA basketball.

On the WNBA side its most notable/notorious female owner was Kelly Loeffler who got run out of Atlanta by her own players due to her rampant Trumpism. Scott and Powell-Jobs are the opposite of that and the baseline of them as people would be a welcome outlier compared to their male counterparts.

Advertisement

Scott is a philanthropist by trade and has made generous donations to organizations like Spark Justice which provides money to bail funds and the Communities Transforming Police Fund an activist group that’s focused on “redefining safety” and investing in “alternatives to police and jails.”

Lowell-Jobs also is heavily involved in philanthropic work. She pledged to donate $3.5 billion to combat climate change. I do disagree with her stance on donor-advised funds which essentially allow donors to remain anonymous because the public should know where the money goes who it goes to and how it’s used to exert influence. That said her contributions to the presidential campaigns of Hilary Clinton and Joe Biden as well as her stake in The Atlantic and public admonishment of Donald Trump paint a picture of someone who possesses the values that the league — and Portlandians — hold dear.

Advertisement

The catch to either of those powerful women taking the helm is last offseason’s coaching search that saw Chauncey Billups get hired over Becky Hammon who would’ve broken barriers as the first female to be a head coach in the NBA. Billups was accused of sexual assault in 1997 and Damian Lillard who we know is incredibly revered in the city caught shit for endorsing Billups as head coach.

His future and the future of the franchise are inextricably linked and who knows how he’d feel if Powell-Jobs or Scott opted to jettison the coach he preferred and one who Lillard said he feels obligated to help succeed. There’s also no guarantee that Scott or Powell-Jobs will be successful as owners because it’s not an easy job.

The one thing that is a certainty is the Trail Blazers will have new ownership and hopefully its passionate loyal and protective fanbase will have an owner that they — and Lillard — can get behind.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvYnVzaW5lc3MvbmV3cy9pbmRpYS13YW50cy10YWtlLWZ1ZWwtYXNzYW0tdHJpcHVyYS10aHJ1LWJhbmdsYWRlc2gtMzAzNDQwNtIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvYnVzaW5lc3MvbmV3cy9pbmRpYS13YW50cy10YWtlLWZ1ZWwtYXNzYW0tdHJpcHVyYS10aHJ1LWJhbmdsYWRlc2gtMzAzNDQwNj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India wants to take fuel from Assam to Tripura via Bangladesh,"Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) today said it plans to transport fuel from Assam to Tripura using Bangladesh territory as the local rail network has been snapped due to massive landslides in Assam.

After the only rail link connecting Assam's Dima Hasao district and Barak Valley with Mizoram Manipur Tripura and the rest parts of India has been washed away earlier this month the corporation started moving all its supplies by road via Meghalaya bearing more than double cost.

""After the landslides in Dima Hasao the only way to reach Manipur Mizoram Tripura and southern Assam was the road connectivity via Meghalaya. This route is also landslide-prone"" IOC Executive Director G Ramesh told PTI in Guwahati.

This situation forced the Indian government to look for alternative ways to supply fuel to the southern region of the Northeast he added.

Ramesh said the company's North East division sent a few consignments to Tripura via Bangladesh in 2016 when the supply was badly hit due to road conditions in Barak Valley in Assam during the monsoon.

""We are trying to revive that six-year-old network as an alternative route. Currently we are talking to the Bangladesh government through the centre. We are hopeful that positive news will come soon"" he added.

The company is planning to send its convoys of fuel through Dawki in Meghalaya to Bangladesh. It will then re-enter India through the Kailashahar area in Tripura.

The distance for transporting different types of fuel from IOC's Betkuchi depot to Dharmanagar depot via Bangladesh will be 376 km including 137 km inside Bangladesh against 579 km in the normal route through the Meghalaya-Barak Valley.",,,,,,

This week: The Women in Trucking Association honors influential women; ANL aims to rehabilitate the Australian turtle population; and C.H. Robinson recognizes its top-quality carriers.

The nonprofit organization Women in Trucking Association announced that Lily Ley vice president and chief information officer at Paccar was presented the 2021 Influential Woman in Trucking award.

The award was created in 2010 to recognize women in trucking who have helped bring other females into the industry and helped advance them in their careers.

Ley who grew up in a two-room home in Mexico with her parents and four siblings moved to the United States after graduating from CETYS Universidad and working as a programmer and system developer for Kenworth Mexicana.

Once in the U.S. she worked her way through a number of Paccar technology positions to become chief information officer and the first woman to be a part of the executive operating committee at the truck manufacturing company.

Ley also has overcome personal obstacles. In 2011 she climbed the highest mountain in Africa Mount Kilimanjaro because she wanted to conquer her fear of heights. And Ley has survived brain cancer — twice.

“What I learned early in life gave me the ability to go beyond every challenge. It gave me a foundation of fundamentals for what I do today. I see everything from different perspectives and I’m able to adjust to special circumstances. … Sometimes you just need to pause when it’s needed. Take a moment reflect on your purpose” Ley said.

Two other women in transportation were nominated and given finalist awards.





Eileen Dabrowski director of learning development and marketing at ReedTMS Logistics was nominated for her philanthropy initiatives mentorship programs and continued advocacy for diversity and inclusion within the industry.

Dabrowski is also a cancer survivor and believes that a balance of self-care and career can help you get the most out of life.

“Challenges and barriers don’t phase me. When things implode around me I keep it together and just figure things out” she said.

Finalist Amanda Schuier is the director of employee engagement at Jetco Delivery.

“My grandfather owned a Mack truck dealership and I was around trucks growing up. But never did I think as a child ‘I want to go into trucking’” said Schuier.

But after being laid off from a marketing firm she took a marketing job at a Paccar dealership. Schuier has since taken on roles in sales dispatching driver relations and safety and she advises women to never stop learning.

“Ask questions. Ask for help. Find mentors and pursue your passions. Remember that there are so many women out there who have been through what you’ve been through — so never feel timid to bounce ideas off others” said Schuier.

ANL launches Turtle Preservation Project

CMA CGM subsidiary Australian National Lines (ANL) on Monday launched its Turtle Preservation Project in partnership with Cairns Turtle Rehabilitation Centre (CTRC) to help rehabilitate and release sea turtles while educating people on the impacts of ocean plastics on their natural habitat.





Unfortunately since plastic has been mass produced in the 1940s 52% of the world’s turtles have eaten plastic waste according to the CTRC. Only one piece of plastic can lead to blockages ruptured organs inability to dive and feed often leading to death.

“The ocean is where we work and thus we have immense respect for it and the life it supports. The Turtle Preservation Project provides an opportunity to give back raise awareness for a challenge in Oceania while supporting a worthy cause aligned with our values. We look forward to seeing the preservation of sea turtles well into the future” said Shane Walden managing director of ANL.

A core piece of the partnership between ANL and CTRC is to help update the rehabilitation center’s tank and pump which will allow for better care of rescued turtles.

“We’re dedicated to the rehabilitation of sick and injured turtles. To do this important work we rely on contributions from many supporters and volunteers. We’re so glad to see ANL and the CMA CGM Group join our team” said Jennie Gilbert co-founder of CTRC.

The bankers from Goldman Sachs and LionTree came with many deal ideas according to four people with knowledge of the meeting. The most logical one the bankers said was combining some parts of Paramount — which owns networks like Nickelodeon and MTV and the Paramount+ streaming service — with those owned by Comcast the cable giant that owns NBCUniversal and the Peacock streaming service. The two companies already have a streaming joint venture in Europe.

But in the end the board Ms. Redstone and Bob Bakish the company’s chief executive did not feel compelled to pursue any of the combinations. They would continue to zig while Hollywood zagged.

Even 36 years after the original summer blockbuster audiences clearly have not lost that lovin’ feeling for the ace fighter pilot. The Joseph Kosinski-directed film is appealing to all demos even moviegoers who weren’t around for the original need for speed but legs are expected as older demos should come out for a movie with mega word of mouth. Again kudos to the Paramount marketing team for a high-octane global promotional push and to the tireless Cruise (see more on the campaign in previous updates below).

Looking at individual markets on TG:M the UK led play at a massive $19.4M from 735 locations. This is the biggest opening weekend for a Tom Cruise film and the biggest for a live-action Paramount title including previews which began ahead of Friday’s official bow.

France lit the fires with $11.7M at 790 locations for the best Cruise bow ever the biggest live-action Paramount start and the all-time record for Ascension weekend.

Australia hit similar milestones for Cruise and Par with $10.7M at 343 sites. Japan delivered a stellar $9.7M at 381. Germany’s start was $6.5M from 701.

Among markets to set Cruise records are also Brazil ($5.3M); Netherlands ($2.4M) Sweden ($2.2M) the Middle East ($6.3M) Belgium ($1.7M) New Zealand ($1.4M); Poland ($1.2M) Argentina ($1.2M) Finland ($1.1M – also the biggest opening of the year) and Portugal ($770K).

While there are some fierce dinosaurs ahead as Universal begins offshore rollout in a handful of markets this coming week on Jurassic World Dominion Maverick still has runway; let’s hope there’s room for everyone after two years of a fractured marketplace.

Maverick employed IMAX cameras and the film grossed $10.4M in the format overseas through Sunday — that reps 8.4% of the international box office from only 350 screens. IMAX also saw its biggest opening weekend for Cruise in 50 markets worldwide with the sequel. Among those 17 delivered Top 10 all-time IMAX opening weekends including the UK France Germany Belgium Japan Hong Kong Singapore Argentina Sweden and Norway.

Markets yet to open include Ukraine and CIS which go next week. It may seem surprising given the ongoing war in Ukraine but we understand that theaters have begun to reopen in the western part of the country. Russia and China are not part of the rollout making the opening numbers even more impressive.

Korea a huge Cruise market — and fortunately not one big on piracy — releases on June 23. The team will travel there ahead of release. Currently in the market local pic The Roundup continues to do bang-up business now at $54.7M after two weekends.

Disney

Elsewhere there were new milestones or near milestones for other films already in release as Disney/Marvel’s Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness is closing in on $500M overseas; Warner Bros’ Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets Of Dumbledore reached $300M offshore and is nearing $400M global. Par’s Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is thisclose to $200M abroad and Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s The Bad Guys is coming up to $200M global (it has reached $29.5M in China to become the highest grossing Hollywood film of 2022 in the market). WB/DC’s The Batman has topped $400M internationally now at $400.9M with $770.2M worldwide.

For its part Doctor Strange 2 saw a good 44% drop overseas even with some uptick in a handful of markets. The weekend was $22.9M in 49 markets for an international total of $497.9M with $868.7M global (when counting domestic’s three-day frame).

Over the session Germany (+4%) and Belgium (+1%) were up on the last while small dips were seen in Netherlands (-4%) France (-10%) Switzerland (-10%) Austria (-21%) Denmark (-21%) Sweden (-32%) and Mexico (-38%) among others.

The Top 5 to date are Korea ($48.3M) UK ($46.5M) Mexico ($38.5M) Brazil ($31.3M) and Australia ($24.7M).

PREVIOUS SATURDAY UPDATE: After a $24.5M Friday in 62 overseas markets Paramount/Skydance’s Top Gun: Maverick has now grossed $64.7M through yesterday at the international box office. This portends an offshore opening weekend for the Tom Cruise-starrer at $110M+. Including domestic’s projected $150M four-day holiday frame that would take the worldwide bow to $260M+.

An international launch at $110M+ would rep a Cruise career-best coming in above Mission: Impossible – Fallout which did $96M in like-for-like markets.

The debut on the Joseph Kosinski-directed sequel is particularly impressive given Russia is not in the mix and that Korea doesn’t release for another month. Global audiences clearly have not lost that lovin’ feeling for Maverick even after 36 years. Exhibitors offshore are also adding screens with the count now at 25000.

Individual market milestones continue to be reached with all majors debuting at No. 1. The UK bowed at No. 1 on Friday with $4M and a 76% market share. This is the biggest opening day for a Tom Cruise movie and also for a live-action Paramount title. The cume there with previews rolled in is $10M.

Japan opened Friday at No. 1 grossing an excellent $2.6M at 381 locations. This is a big Cruise market and the massive premiere event is paying dividends.

France continued its great roll with another $2.3M on Friday at 790 cinemas. The cume through Friday is $8.2M. Australia added $2M yesterday at 343 sites for a running $4.5M total Germany picked up another $1.5M on Friday at 701 with a $3.9M cume to date. Brazil has cumed $3.1M through Friday and Mexico $2.8M.

We’ll have a full update on Sunday.

PREVIOUS FRIDAY: Paramount’s Top Gun: Maverick is soaring in its overseas debuts clocking $33M from 47 markets at the international box office through Thursday. The Tom Cruise-starrer officially launched on Wednesday offshore following paid previews in some hubs and adds another 15 markets today bringing the total to 62 in what is the studio’s widest release ever internationally on nearly 24000 screens.

Word of mouth is sky high on the sequel that comes 36 years after the original summer blockbuster and an $80M+ overseas opening weekend is assured.

Deadline

Highlights so far include France which bowed Wednesday to $1.8M scoring the biggest opening day for a Paramount live-action title and also for Cruise in the market. Thursday added $2.9M for the best Ascension Day opening of any movie there ever. Rolled up with previews the France cume through Thursday is $5.9M. The movie has 4.5 stars out of 5 from audiences who are turning out in the cities and the provinces across varied demos.

In Australia Thursday’s debut was $1.5M for a $2.5M total including previews. This is Cruise’s biggest opening day ever Down Under. Germany debuted to $1.6M for a $2.5M cume with previews. Brazil likewise has cumed $2.5M so far while Mexico is at $2.1M.

AP

New markets added today on the pic that’s co-financed and co-produced by Skydance include the UK Spain and Japan. Overall the movie is on track to be Cruise’s top opening of all time internationally — as well as domestically.

Awareness is through the roof on Maverick and a shoutout is deserved for the Paramount marketing team and the indefatigable Cruise.

The promotional campaign has very likely been visible from space. The film screened for exhibition in Las Vegas (where cheers and sniffles were audible from the audience) and then world premiered in San Diego with Cruise arriving via helicopter on the deck of the USS Midway. From there the team traveled to Mexico City and then on to Cannes where the film was greeted with a flyover and Cruise was feted by the festival with an honorary Palme d’Or and a sustained standing ovation.

AP

The next day the Top Gun crew was in London for the Royal Film Performance. In Japan the Yokohama Osanbashi Pier featured a fireworks display ahead of the premiere in IMAX all of which was livestreamed into four additional IMAX theaters around the country.

The foreign interest in the Skydance co-produced sequel that centers on the American military — and one that arrives decades after the original — is a credit to its star as well as top-flight marketing that included its Cannes premiere. This is also Tom Cruise’s biggest opening ever including adjustments for inflation.

More importantly Cruise’s return to the character that propelled him into superstardom 36 years ago also represents a significant advancement for theater recovery.

It is the highest initial gross for any non-comic book movie since December 2019. Propelling its success is an audience that’s been slow to return. It is also that rarest of creatures: a standalone film propelled by a star’s draw.

Though not the biggest Memorial Day opening “Maverick” might have had the highest average per-ticket price of any blockbuster (thanks to recent increases including premium showings).

This weekend not including the Monday holiday totaled $175 million. That’s a good comp against 2019 which grossed $181 million and had a greater depth of offerings (“Aladdin” accounted for half of that total while “Maverick” was over 70 percent). At 96 percent compared to three years ago that is a strong indication of recovery. The four-week rolling comparison to the same period in 2019 rebounded to 78 percent.

Perhaps best of all is how this was achieved. “Maverick” had by far the most interest of older audiences of any film in the Covid era. A majority (55 percent) was over 35. That is far different from most top-grossing films even in pre-Covid times. For the current environment it is a major victory.

“Maverick” audiences were 37 percent 18-34 with 34 percent non-white (less than other top titles) and 58 percent male — less the 62 percent for the first weekend of “Doctor Strange.”

The best news is the A+ Cinemascore. That’s the same as “Spider-Man: No Way Home” (with its more than double opening). A rating like that means positive response across the board. Between the likelihood that adults are still lagging a bit this suggests a significant multiple ahead. Doable: $400 million domestic or more.

“The Bob’s Burger’s Movie” (Disney) was the second wide studio opening placing #3 with $12600000. This was also a bit above expectations. The Fox Animation spin-off from the TV series is significant just for its theatrical release rather than going directly to Disney+. Whether this level of interest satisfies Disney will have to be determined (including how well it holds in the three weeks before “Lightyear” the next animated release).

Disney also took second place with “Doctor Strange” with $16.4 million now just shy of $371 million. It should be the first 2021 release to reach a $400 million domestic total.

The holdovers varied greatly in stamina. “Downton Abbey: A New Era” (Focus) fell 63 percent in weekend two compared to 54 percent for the earlier film. Overlapping age appeal for “Maverick” despite different genres (to say the least) likely accounted for this. “Downton” during the week did better than average; by normal calculations it would predict an $8 million-$9 million weekend compared to the actual $5.9 million.

Two notable numbers among other top 10 titles. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (A24) is now just shy of $57 million. That figure is now ahead of “Parasite” which at $55 million (including its Oscar boost) stands as a top result for a specialized release. Though “Everything” isn’t non-English it is just as offbeat as Neon’s Korean hit. It could go as high as $65 million.

Sandra Bullock (aided by co-star Channing Tatum) was key to boosting “The Lost City” (Paramount) over $100 million this weekend. That’s another non-franchise title for older audiences — in its case boosted by women.

Along with “Sonic the Hedgehog 2” and now “Maverick” that makes three Paramount films this year to pass $100 million domestic. Only seven films have reached that in 2022 and Paramount has the highest total.

Of note in the struggling limited specialized market are initial results for two sold-out shows for the “Freakscene: the Story of Dinosaur Jr.” (Utopia). The rock documentary will have more than 70 similar showings on Tuesday.

Neon debuted “A Chiara” in two theaters taking in a modest $5000.

Let me count the ways. Actually let’s not even try because it’s not anywhere near as straightforward as a haircut for two bits.

For the last couple of years we’ve tracked three digital payments fintech stocks eventually investing in the one that we felt offered the best growth opportunities and diversification. With the air rapidly going out of the current dot-com.2 bubble we recently re-evaluated our strategy and promised to dive more deeply into the businesses of both PayPal (PYPL) and Adyen (ADYEN.AS). In this article we’ll mostly focus on our current investment Adyen stock.

PayPal is a favourite channel for Kenyans engaged in online transactions such as freelance coding research transcription translation programming writing graphic design and digital marketing. Additionally companies such as Tiktok Fiverr Scribie and Upwork only use PayPal to transact with content generators internationally making the platform a critical service provider.

Besides delayed cash disbursements Kenyan users of PayPal have also complained about their accounts being disabled without warning.

“I had to wait for six months to get money that was held in my account but even after the period ended the system gave me errors when I tried to withdraw the money” said Paul Kamau who signed up for a PayPal account when he started doing coding and programming jobs online.

He says no reason was given for the blockage of his account.

Many Kenyans have lodged their complaints on PayPal’s Twitter handle. The company neither has a physical customer care centre in Kenya nor a call centre. When users are faced with transaction hitches they can only talk to PayPal customer care agents on Twitter Facebook email or through the message centre on the PayPal App.

Contacted for comment regarding the customer frustrations it said it could only respond to specific customer issues.

“There is no such information till now. If there is any account holders will receive an email notification” said PayPal in a response to Sunday Nation.

PayPal handles about 190 transactions per second according to a 2018 study by software engineer Federico Kunze. This is attributed to the increased number of jobs and companies that are purely run online and often use PayPal to pay employees and receive payments from clients.

For many Kenyan freelancers however the platform has proved unreliable making it hard for them to retrieve their earnings. Kamau says that as he tried to find ways to retrieve his cash he discovered that other Kenyans had a similar problem.

“I met a lady who had Sh233200 (about $2000) held in her account. That is when I realised that there was a big problem” he said.

An email notification with the subject “You can no longer do business with PayPal” is one of the most dreaded messages for PayPal users. “After a review we decided to permanently limit your account as we found potential risk associated with it. You’ll not be able to conduct any further business using PayPal. If you have funds in your PayPal balance we’ll hold it for up to 180 days. After that period we’ll email you with information on how to access your funds” reads the message from the firm.

The PayPal user agreement states that an account can be limited if they suspect that another person could be using a client’s account without their knowledge or if they have reason to believe that a client has breached the agreement.

“The company assumes that Kenyans work the same way as Americans. To retrieve your money they ask for a proof of address virtual service or goods bought through them” says Kamau.

PayPal launched a partnership with M-Pesa in 2018 but this has also not been a smooth sail especially without a local customer care unit for handling queries. The service is provided by Thunes a business-to-business (B2B) mobile payment network connecting financial institutions and mobile operators based in Singapore. Kenyan users who have issues using the service have to contact Thunes customer care agents.

Kamau says he realised that the easier way to withdraw money from PayPal when your account is deactivated is through M-Pesa. “If your account gets limited you cannot withdraw from the bank. M-Pesa is the best option for Kenyans but we do not get proper support from PayPal” he said.

Walter Akolo a freelance writer and long-time user of PayPal advises Kenyans to link a bank account to their PayPal account to prove their credibility and avoid their accounts getting limited. He says Equity Bank offers the fastest withdrawal rates from PayPal which takes two to three days.

“After PayPal limits an account they ask for some information such as a national identification card business registration certificate (for business accounts) or invoices. Sadly for many accounts nowadays even after you have provided them with all that they still permanently limit or close the account” Akolo said.

This has led to Kenyans turning to other favourable options such as Wise Sendwave and Payoneer.

Only 14 African countries are allowed to receive and send money on the PayPal platform while 36 other African countries are only allowed to make payments.

The Twitter hashtag #BoycottPayPal spread overseas when the firm was accused of taking part in an organised economic war and was allegedly used to silence two international media outlets MintPress News and Consortium News alongside several of their journalists by cancelling their accounts without any prior warning or proper explanation.

Many users have threatened to permanently cancel their accounts even as the firm’s shares lost roughly a quarter of their value in February to higher inflation affecting consumer spending.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vZG9uYXRlLXVrcmFpbmUtbW9uZXktYXZvaWQtY2hhcml0eS1zY2Ftcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is It Safe to Donate Money to Ukraine Online?

FASTag: How To Check Balance Online Using SMS | A Step-by-step Guide

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to make the use of FASTags mandatory from February 15 2021 for all four-wheelers.

New Delhi: From promoting digital payments to making almost all government services and benefits available online the Modi government in last 8 years has taken a slew of measures to digitise the economy. In addition to this the government has also introduced a service called FASTag for making payments on toll booths across the country.

What A FASTag?

FASTag is a Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) introduced by the Government of India in October 2017 by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway. This measure was taken keeping in scrutiny several inconveniences for both individual drivers and the nation at large.

Steps to check FASTag balance using NHAI Prepaid Wallet

Step 1: Open Play Store or App Store

Step 2: Download the My FASTag App on your Android phone or iPhone.

Step 3: Now enter your log in details.

Step 4: You can now view your balance amount.

How to check FASTag balance with banks

Step 1: Go to the website of your bank that you have linked to your FASTag account.

Step 2: Now log in to the FASTag Portal with your credentials

Step 3: Click on View Balance option to check the balance.

How to check FASTag balance using SMS

Register for the FASTag service then you will receive an SMS every time an amount gets deducted from your FASTag account at a toll booth. This SMS in addition to showing the deduction amount will also notify you about your FASTag account balance toll payments and recharge confirmations among other things.

How does FASTag Work?

FASTag works like any other radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies. There is a RFID enabled sticker fixed to a vehicle’s windshield and a reader at the toll booth can scan this card and wirelessly and automatically processes the payment.

Benefits of FASTag

When you pass a FASTag-enabled toll plaza you won’t have to stop your car to make a cash payment for the toll fee. Instead you can just keep driving and the fee will be paid automatically.

She is interested in learning how global issues affect individuals on a micro level. Before joining Newschecker’s English team she was working with Latestly.

Were pilgrims at Mecca witness to a magical moment when the ‘unseen’ were offering prayers at the Kaaba? Did Kerala bus driver violate the uniform code by wearing an ‘Islamic Attire’? Did Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla wow everyone at the WEF (Word Economic Conference) in Davos with his company’s latest invention- the microchip pill? No no and NO.

Social media this past week has seen fake claims ranging from communal to COVID misinformation and Newschecker is at the forefront debunking these false claims and calling them out. Here are some of the most viral instances of fake news that Newschecker debunked this week:

Malda Imam Attacked By ‘Hindutvawadi Bigot’? No Viral Claim Is Misleading A video showing an aged man bleeding while being held up by a few people amid the commotion is being widely shared online. Identifying the man as the Imam of Kotwali Mosque in West Bengal’s Malda social media users alleged that he was attacked by a ‘Hindutvawadi bigot of the VHP’. Newschecker has found that the post claiming that the Malda Imam was attacked is not true. Read more here.

No Kerala Bus Driver Did Not Wear ‘Islamic Attire’ On Duty Social media users on Twitter are sharing an image showing a bus driver on duty wearing what appears to be a white Kurta & a skull cap with a long beard as opposed to the standard sky blue shirt and pants. Many users questioned the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation over the ‘flagrant violation’ of the uniform policy while others wondered if it would be made standard across other state forces including police and fire force. We found that the image is being shared out of context. Read more here.

Miracle In Kaaba? No Viral Claim About Prayer By The ‘Unseen’ In Mecca Is False Viral claims about doors of Kaaba opening “miraculously” and “jinns and angels” performing prayers is untrue. The video was shot during the month of Ramadan and the door of the Kaaba was opened for one of the Muslim Leaders visiting the Haram. We found that the viral claims about doors of Kaaba opening “miraculously” and “jinns and angels” performing prayers is untrue. Read more here.

Viral Video Of Pfizer CEO Discussing ‘Pills With Microchip’ Shared Out Of Context A video of Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla speaking at the World Economic Forum is going viral on social media where he is heard referring to pills with a ‘biological chip’ that sends a signal once ingested. Online users are sharing the video believing it to be a new innovation of the Pfizer company linked to the COVID pandemic. Newschecker found that the video was shared out of context and is unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more here.

This Video of Policemen Rescuing Themselves After Rickshaw Overturns is NOT Related To Assam Floods A video showing an e-rickshaw getting overturned in a water-logged street is being shared on social media platforms claiming that the incident happened recently in flood-hit Assam. We found that the video of policemen struggling after their vehicle overturns in knee deep water is neither recent nor from Assam . It was captured in 2021 in Rajasthan’s Dausa district and is being shared falsely in context to recent floods in Assam. Read more here.

S Sridhar country manager Pfizer India told FE “Globally we plan to introduce 25 new therapies by 2025. The work at this centre can serve several of these therapy areas. The centre also provides technical support for products that are already in the market.”

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

After a wild pitch moved the runners up 60 feet into scoring position Simpson came through with back-to-back strikeouts of designated player Linnie Malkin and right fielder Kacie Hoffmann. Second baseman Audrie LaValley stepped up facing a massive early spot and flew out to right center as Simpson & the Longhorns escaped a huge early jam.After Jefferson was left stranded following her single-season Texas record 21st double of the season in the top of the third the Razorbacks threatened again in their half of the frame. Shortstop Marlene Friedman originally struck out but reached first base on a Simpson wild pitch. Center fielder KB Sides then walked and a wild pitch moved the runners to second and third with still no outs. Following a fly out to left catcherhit a chopper to short. UT's Washington fielded the ball cleanly and fired a strike to the plate as Iakopo applied the tag on Friedman to prevent a run from scoring. From there Simpson got a huge strikeout of Gibson to fight her way out of another massive threat.

A two-out Sides bloop single to center and a McEwen walk got UA back in business in the bottom of the fifth. Former Longhorns standout Ellsworth stepped into the box facing another huge moment in the game and popped up to catcher as Iakopo raced out to make the catch.

With Texas needing an offensive spark Jefferson provided a huge one opening the sixth as the senior launched a leadoff double off the wall in left center. Scott came to the dish and dropped a perfect bunt up the third-base line for a single and quickly swiped second to station two in scoring position with still no outs. That's when Washington delivered the hit of the game by launching a two-RBI double to center to stake the Longhorns to a 2-0 advantage. Iakopo followed immediately with a RBI single of her own to left as Washington scored easily from third to make it 3-0.



The Razorbacks wasted no time fighting back as Gibson christened their half of the sixth with a single to right. Gammill walked to put two on with still no outs as Bogle Park roared to life in support. After a fielder's choice cut down a runner at second UA's Hoffmann hit a bouncer to short. Washington corralled the ball and tossed to Jefferson to start a crucial 6-4-3 double play to slide Texas free of another jam.

Facing one last chance to get back into the game in the bottom of the seventh Arkansas got the first two batters aboard on a single and a walk. Texas' defense and Simpson again proved up to the task as a fielder's choice a pop-up to third and a deep fly out to left set off Burnt Orange & White jubilation

Texas Baseball (42-19) falls to OU 8-1 in the Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship. Before the game was over the NCAA announced that Texas was selected as NCAA Regional host at UFCU Disch-Falk Field for the second-consecutive season and the 28th time ever.

Oklahoma's pitching proved to much for Texas striking out 16 of the 33 batters Texas sent to the plate.

Texas troubles started in the third inning after Travis Sthele was called for a balk pitch that scored OU's second run. Coach Pierce had a heated conversation with the umpire then called time to go to the mound to talk with Sthele. While at the mound Pierce and home plate umpire had more words after plate umpire walked to the mound and appeared to get into Pierce's face. OU scored eight runs in the third that would secure the win and championship.

Texas had only four hits and one run from Melendez' home run. Murphy Stehly doubled Austin Todd and Trey Faltine both had hits. Texas used five pitches.

ARLINGTON Texas – No. 19 Texas Baseball bounced back to beat Oklahoma State 9-2 in the semifinals of the Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship on Saturday at Globe Life Field. The Longhorns (42-18) advance to the championship game against Oklahoma on Sunday at 5 p.m. on ESPNU.

The Texas pitching staff was outstanding as five different pitchers combined to hold the Cowboys to only two runs on five hits.

Andre Duplantier II started and pitched two innings allowing one run on two hits. Jared Southard gave the Longhorns 1 2/3 scoreless out of the bullpen with a pair of strikeouts and picked up his third win of the season.

Luke Harrison got the Longhorns out of a jam in the fourth inning and went on to pitch 2 1/3 innings of relief with just one run allowed on one hit. Marcus Olivarez pitched two scoreless innings out of the bullpen working around two hits and striking out two batters. Tristan Stevens finished the game with a perfect ninth including two strikeouts.

Trey Faltine had a huge day at the plate going 3-for-5 with two doubles four RBI and two runs scored.

Oklahoma State got the first run of the game in the bottom of the first on a sacrifice fly to take a 1-0 lead.

Texas took the lead right back with two runs on two hits and an error in the second inning. Austin Todd hit a single to start the inning and Silas Ardoin walked with one out. An error allowed Todd to score from second and an infield single by Faltine drove in the second run.

The Longhorns put together a five-run top of the third to extend their lead to 7-1. Ivan Melendez and Murphy Stehly both singled to start the inning before Todd loaded the bases on an errant throw from a bunt. With two outs Faltine hammered a bases-clearing double to left field. Hodo followed with an RBI double of his own to drive in Faltine.

Texas expanded its lead out to 9-1 with three more big hits in the fifth inning. Faltine hit his second double of the game before pinch-hitter Dylan Campbell lined an RBI triple to center field. Melendez followed with an RBI single to drive in Campbell and make the score 9-1.

The Cowboys got one run back on a solo homer in the fifth inning to trim the lead to 9-2 but that was all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0cmYuY29tL2dvbGRhbmRibHVlbmF0aW9uL21pY2hhZWwtZ3JvdmUtcmVjYWxsZWQtYnktbGEtZG9kZ2Vycy_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy53dHJmLmNvbS9nb2xkYW5kYmx1ZW5hdGlvbi9taWNoYWVsLWdyb3ZlLXJlY2FsbGVkLWJ5LWxhLWRvZGdlcnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Grove recalled by LA Dodgers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wtrf.com/goldandbluenation/michael-grove-recalled-by-la-dodgers/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0cmYuY29tL2dvbGRhbmRibHVlbmF0aW9uL21pY2hhZWwtZ3JvdmUtcmVjYWxsZWQtYnktbGEtZG9kZ2Vycy_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy53dHJmLmNvbS9nb2xkYW5kYmx1ZW5hdGlvbi9taWNoYWVsLWdyb3ZlLXJlY2FsbGVkLWJ5LWxhLWRvZGdlcnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdHduZXdzcHJlc3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jb3dib3ktYmFzZWJhbGwtdGVhbS1mYWxscy1vbmUtZ2FtZS1zaG9ydC1vZi1iaWctMTItdG91cm5hbWVudC1maW5hbHMtYXdhaXRzLXJlZ2lvbmFsLWZhdGUvYXJ0aWNsZV9iZDIzYTg2OC1kZWY1LTExZWMtYTE0Ny0yMzk1NWZjMWY4MDEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cowboy baseball team falls one game short of Big 12 tournament finals awaits regional fate,OSU third baseman Nolan McLean (right) rounds the bases after hitting a solo home run in the fifth inning of the Big 12 tournament semifinals.

With a salute to Jersey girls of course. That's what Tim McGraw did at his season-opening concert Friday May 27 at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel. The country superstar turned his hit “Southern Girl” into “Jersey Girl.”

The 15000 or so in the audience loved it.

“I've met a few Jersey girls in my life — a long time ago” said McGraw who's married to fellow country superstar Faith Hill.

Hill did not make an appearance at the show — except for the “Faith” tattoo on McGraw's right shoulder. It was all McGraw on Friday with his big shoulders and belt buckle. Yet the out-sized country image belies a sensitivity — this is a guy who understands the frailties of life.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

Take his “Live Like You Were Dying” written for his late father New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies star Tug McGraw who died in 2004 at the age of 59. Seize the day because the day is short.

As the song ended McGraw tapped his thigh much like the way his dad would at the end of an inning. “Humble and Kind” was dedicated to Texas where a May 19 school shooting there took the lives of 21.

McGraw is best on ballads — that's where his full and sonorous tenor shines. His recent single “The Cowboy in Me” presented with clips of TV's “Yellowstone” nicely framed McGraw's stirring vocals.

But this was a party and McGraw brought along a few friends out for the fun. Show openers Russell Dickerson Alexandra Kay and Brandon Davis joined him on stage for “I Life It I Love It” and Danny Clinch the Toms River photographer of the stars joined in on “Indian Outlaw.”

Clinch plays a mean harmonica and he literally put down his camera to play.

“Damn he's good” McGraw said of Clinch.

Fans also spoke favorably of the new amenities at the venue.

John Crivelli of Hillsborough downed a Questlove Impossible Cheesesteak.

“They didn't have a regular cheesesteak just the Impossible” Crivelli said. “Listen we both teach — it was good as the school food.”

The venue updated and expanded the restrooms last season.

“The updates to the bathroom have been great.” Crivelli said.

Caitlin Nichols of Great Meadows enjoyed a watermelon margarita that had a pink cowboy hat mixer in the concourse before McGraw's set. Nichols and companion Seth Leonard of Gettysburg Pa. gave the experience two thumbs up.

The Lumineers bring their Brightside Word Tour to the venue on Saturday May 28.

“My name is Tim or Faith’s husband … or maybe Tug’s boy in these parts” McGraw wondered to a packed house at PNC Bank Arts Center Friday night. "" … Or James Dutton which would make me Margaret’s husband.”

Now for those unfamiliar with the goings-on of one Samuel Timothy McGraw beyond his solo country music smashes at least he’s been married to fellow star Faith Hill for 25 years. He’s also the son of storied MLB pitcher Tug McGraw who won World Series championships with the Mets and Phillies (1969 1980) — hence the smattering of McGraw baseball jerseys spotted around the Holmdel amphitheater Friday mixing it up with the cowboy hats and leather boots.

As for the James Dutton stuff McGraw’s semi-regular acting career hit a new peak last year as he and Hill (who plays his wife Margaret Dutton) co-star in the popular TV western drama “1883.” Some caps and shirts celebrating the hit Paramount+ show were also seen at PNC and kept mercifully dry as looming thunderstorms spared the 10000 or so of fans packed onto the lawn.

But this performance the venue’s first show of the season — effectively kicking off New Jersey’s loaded summer concert schedule — was indeed tailored to McGraw as most folks know him. He remains the crooning silk-throated and playful star responsible for one of the most commercially successful country careers of the last 30 years. The man with 25 No. 1 singles among them twangy party favorites like “I Like It I Love It” and “Something Like That” and the more introspective self-help mega-ballads like “Live Like You Were Dying” and “Humble and Kind.”

Unsurprisingly McGraw used his 90 minutes in Central Jersey — part of his first solo tour in seven years delayed since 2020 due to COVID — to blast through his greatest hits including all the tunes mentioned above and plenty more any lifelong fan would expect to hear.

It was a high-octane night of barreling country jams and a fine kick-off to Memorial Day Weekend 2022 boosted by a booming six-piece band who spent most of their time on a multi-tiered riser resembling an Olympics medal podium. And at the center was the 55-year-old leader who looked equal parts Hollywood and Nashville; perfectly tanned and blazing white smile cowboy hat cutoff shirt (revealing his “Faith” tattoo) massive golden belt buckle and some of the most unforgiving blue jeans I’ve ever seen.

McGraw didn’t say much to the crowd of 15000-plus noting early “we don’t bulls*** a lot we don’t talk a lot we just play music.” But he was sure to tap into the night’s requisite nostalgia showing a collage of early-career videos during “Something Like That” and making sure the fans knew how old some of his tunes were. “Let’s take it back to 1994″ he said for the somber cut “Don’t Take the Girl” his first No. 1 single. Then after jamming his latest single August 2021′s “7500 OBO” (with a music video starring his 19-year-old daughter Audrey) he quickly reverted to 1992 for “Memory Lane.” Just before “One of the Those Nights” his school-age niece ran onto stage receiving an emphatic high-five from all smiles McGraw.

Other mid-tempo tunes like “Over and Over” (2004 with rapper Nelly) and “Better than I Used to Be” (2012) created a bit of a lull in the show’s middle before the heavy-hitting guitar jams reignited the crowd: “Real Good Man” (with rodeo scenes on the big screen) “Truck Yeah” (with flames and domestic pick-ups) and of course “I Like It I Love It” accompanied by openers Russell Dickerson Alexandra Kay and Brandon Davis and a towering crowd sing-along surely heard down the Parkway.

Before a three-song encore the set closed with “Live Like You Were Dying” a somehow even grander — and certainly more cathartic — anthem of never taking a day for granted (and perhaps attempting bull-riding).

The sweeping ballad “Humble and Kind” finished out the show and fans spanning seniors to children streamed to their cars ready to keep the Memorial Day Weekend party going — or get stuck in traffic.

The long walk down pit lane with his wife Emma included many hugs and apologies from the drivers he was trying to beat just minutes earlier. Ed Carpenter stopped him. Then Tony Kanaan. And Graham Rahal.

When he reached Victory Podium to congratulate his teammate Marcus Ericsson on winning “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” former teammate Dario Franchitti offered him a hug as did Ericsson.

They were all sorry Dixon didn’t earn his second Indianapolis 500 victory because his No. 9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda was the class of the field on Sunday. But a pit lane speeding violation on Lap 175 of 200 erased his chances of adding his face to the Borg-Warner Trophy yet again. His only other “500” win came in 2008.

The only words six-time NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Dixon could muster to describe Sunday were simple:

“It’s heartbreaking to be honest” Dixon said. “I just messed up.”

NTT P1 Award winner Dixon dominated the day from the pole. Though the Kiwi didn’t lead Lap 1 – his teammate Alex Palou did – Dixon took the lead for the first time on Lap 8. From there he and his teammate Palou the defending NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion traded the lead back-and-forth over the first third of the race.

Palou had to make an emergency stop in a closed pit under caution to fuel his No. 10 NTT DATA Chip Ganassi Racing Honda on Lap 68 which resulted in a penalty and essentially took him out of contention for the race. From there the race was Dixon’s to lose.

Dixon controlled the next 100 laps and led 95 of the 200 total laps a race-high mark. As Dixon hit pit road from the lead for his final pit stop on Lap 175 he made a crucial mistake: He sped entering pit lane.

Dixon said he was pushing his orange-and-blue car all he could to keep an edge on his closest competitors. Upon entering pit lane he locked the rear brakes and then the front brakes. He estimates he entered pit lane just 1 mph faster than allowed.

Nonetheless that was all it took to rip away an ice-cold drink of milk and a kiss of the bricks after 500 grueling miles at the Racing Capital of the World.

One could argue it was the third consecutive year Dixon missed a chance for victory in the Indianapolis 500. In 2020 he led 111 laps but finished second as a late-race caution ended the race under yellow and crowned Takuma Sato the winner.

Last year Dixon had a fast car all May long. He won the NTT P1 Award for pole and led the race early but a penalty for emergency service in a closed pit under caution early in the race trapped him a lap down. He finished 17th.

“I feel extremely bad for him” said Dixon’s Chip Ganassi Racing teammate Kanaan. “He's a dear friend of mine. I know how bad he's feeling. That's the kind of thing that will haunt you quite a bit for a little bit. You're going to wake up in the morning thinking about it.

“It's one thing when something out of your control happens but when we as drivers make a mistake it's pretty hard.”

Dixon’s longtime team owner Chip Ganassi who won his first Indy 500 as a team owner in 10 years with Ericsson’s victory in a wild finish was equally subdued in regards to the mistake.

“I mean he came down pit lane and was speeding” Ganassi said. “He’s as disappointed as anybody I can tell you.”

It was a frustrating end to a historic month for Dixon. He earned his fifth career Indy 500 pole last weekend putting him in sole possession of second on the all-time poles list. To get there he drove the fastest four-lap average speed for a pole sitter in the century-plus history of the race at 234.046 mph.

During the race Dixon catapulted from third to first all-time in Indy 500 laps led. Coming into Sunday’s race Al Unser was the all-time lap leader at 644 while Ralph DePalma was second at 612. Dixon entered his 20th “500” with 570 laps led.

With his 95 laps led around the famed 2.5-mile oval Dixon elevated the record to 665 laps led in his Indianapolis 500 career on what would have been Unser’s 83rd birthday. Unser passed away Dec. 9 2021 after a lengthy battle with cancer.

One day when Dixon’s legendary career is finished he will certainly cherish his place in Indianapolis 500 history and his name alongside those of Unser A.J. Foyt Mario Andretti Rick Mears and many more. But for now the records don’t heal the wound that is not winning the Indianapolis 500.

“I don’t know what it will mean” Dixon said. “I’ll probably still think about the misses and not leading the right lap. You only need to lead one lap here and that’s the last one.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC10YXlsb3Itb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQ5NTkyMTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Taylor Obituary - House of Law Inc.

The pools have been abuzz with trainees from all age groups especially during this unforgiving summer. Enrolments have been pouring in as children parents and professionals make the best use of the facility.





The trainees at the GHMC BV Gurumurthy Memorial Swimming Pool in Secunderabad were delighted to return to the pool. “This is my second time at the summer camp. I had learned to swim in this pool before the pandemic and am excited to be back” nine-year-old Roshan Raj said.





Pranathi a class VI student of Lotus Model School is all praise for the coaches. “I am a beginner. Initially I was scared of the water but the coaches here helped me get over my fear and taught me how to swim. Now I can swim on my own” she said.





Not just students even office-goers are a happy lot as they can get back to







staying fit. Praveen a software employee said “It’s cool to swim. Before the pandemic I used to come here every year. It helps me stay fit and active all day. I’m happy that the pool has opened up.” The 46-year-old who has also enrolled his kid in the camp thanked the government and pool staff for providing a comfortable environment. “In my opinion this is one of the best pools in the city” he said.





Prasad a businessman is a senior swimmer and has been a regular at the BV Gurumurthy Memorial Swimming Pool for the last 30 years. “The pool was supposed to open a bit early but it opened in May. I have been swimming for the last three decades and it has become a part of my life.” The 60-year-old finds the facility economical. “No other pool in Hyderabad provides these facilities at this cost. The administration is maintaining it well. The only thing which has disappointed me is that they have changed the pool holiday to Sundays without any intimation. It used to be shut on Mondays” he said.

The tourist resort on the complex was recently reopened with air-conditioned rooms swimming pool restaurants and the upcoming attractions include soft adventure sports and rides.Located on 16 acres the park was unveiled in 2015 and offers facilities like camping boating and soft adventure sports.The Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation project never quite took off the way it was expected to. While the park remained closed during the third Covid-19 wave in the winter DTTDC tried to make the project more attractive for visitors by reopening 20 AC and furnished cottages with modern amenities unlike the camping sites offered earlier.An official said that the Kanganheri complex opened earlier this month with rooms a small restaurant and a swimming pool. “Other facilities like rides and soft adventure are yet to be provided” he said.However the eco-park at Chhawla which is part of the complex has been closed for the time being. “It operated for around two months but has been shut down due to almost nil visitors” the official said. “The idea behind the project is for Delhiites to enjoy nature. Once you are at the park it is difficult to imagine you are in the city anymore. We thought that people visiting the place would like to stay back and soak in the beauty and that is why these facilities have been created.”The official added “New walking trails have been created around the complex for visitors and we have also tried to create a rural setting here. Visitors can see farming being done from close quarters for instance. Since the complex is located on the fringes of the capital and the area is green and serene the village setting was recreated to give visitors a feel of rural Delhi.”The complex now boasts a refurbished swimming pool which can also be used by those not staying at the complex for a fee. Rides on all-terrain vehicles are being provided at the complex and more soft adventure sports are going to be added soon the official said.To attract more visitors there were plans to allow theme-based parties and picnics at the park even though requests for weddings and marriage receptions will not be entertained. The earlier plan to allow a bar on the premises has been suspended for the time being sources said.DTTDC had also been toying with the idea of providing canoeing and kayaking facilities on a larger scale at the Najafgarh drain in the future. The official said that once the water in the drain is clean with water being sourced from sewage treatment plants upstream arrangements can be made for kayaking.,,,,,,

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

The Driving Small Business Forward grant program will provide ten grants of $25000 to eligible small businesses.

Funding can be used toward the purchase of a commercial vehicle.

Progressive Insurance Supporting Hispanic Entrepreneurs with $25K Small Business Grants

A 2021 study by McKinsey & Company found that Hispanic entrepreneurs start more businesses per capita than other groups. Specifically Latino-owned employer firms has grown by 12.5 percent annually over the past five years. White-owned employer firms have only grown by 5.3 percent per year in that same time period. However Hispanic entrepreneurs see more barriers when it comes to financing their business. They’re both less likely to apply for outside funding and less likely to receive the funds they do apply for even when compared to White business owners with similar credit ratings. This leaves many entrepreneurs in this group scrambling to bootstrap their own ventures or relying on funds from family and friends. Programs like Driving Small Business Forward aim to close these gaps for entrepreneurs that need funding but don’t always have access to equitable resources.

The Importance of Commercial Vehicles

Vehicles have become an increasingly important yet expensive commodity for both individuals and businesses. A huge array of companies from home service providers like plumbers to shuttle companies rely on quality vehicles to serve customers and support their daily operations. However purchasing new commercial or fleet vehicles isn’t as attainable a goal as it was even just a few years ago. Elizabeth Gore Co-Founder and President of Hello Alice said in a statement about the new grant program “When we asked small business owners on our platform to rank their biggest challenge in 2022 they selected inflation. Now more than ever it’s important that small business owners get the resources they need to address these challenges. We commend Progressive for their ongoing support of the small businesses that contribute to a thriving and vibrant economy.”

Night of Firsts as Daniels Wins Red Mile I By 0.008 Seconds

DAYTONA BEACH Fla. (May 29 2022) – It was a night of firsts as Progressive American Flat Track enjoyed an epic evening of racing at the Mission Red Mile I presented by Indian Motorcycle of Lexington in Lexington Kentucky.

Following 14 minutes and two laps of nail-biting action in front of the massive Red Mile crowd Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle rookie Dallas Daniels (No. 32 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) officially added his name to the exclusive list of premier-class Main Event winners.

But prior to Daniels’ exhilaration it was heartbreak for teammate JD Beach (No. 95 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT). Beach had established himself the rider to beat in the lead-up to the Main but he was unlucky to be forced out by mechanical issues a couple minutes into the race.

That left reigning champion Jared Mees (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) Daniels and Mission Production Twins Challenge entrant James Rispoli (No. 43 Wally Brown Racing/Haversack KTM 890 Duke) to battle it out in the lead pack.

The trend of heartbreak continued a couple of minutes later when the machine of Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Latus Motors Racing Harley-Davidson XG750R) dumped oil on the circuit while running fourth forcing a red flag stoppage near half-distance.

The race resumed with Mees Daniels and Rispoli sitting 1-2-3 and Brandon Robinson (No. 44 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) joining the lead group in fourth. While Rispoli took a peak on a few occasions it was Mees and Daniels who traded back first and second for the remainder of the contest.

Mees lined up Daniels and made what he hoped would be the race’s decisive maneuver entering Turn 3 for the final time. He pulled it off perfectly and seemed destined to keep his perfect Red Mile streak intact right up until the final moment when Daniels blasted by at the stripe to steal away the win by 0.008 seconds.

The victory was not only Daniels’ first in the premier class it was also Yamaha’s first on a Mile going all the way back to Kenny Roberts’ legendary victory aboard the TZ750 at the 1975 Indy Mile. Daniels also became the first rookie to win in the premier class since Mikey Rush won at Daytona in 2007 and the first rookie to win on a Mile since Scott Parker did so at Indy in 1979.

“I can’t believe I won a Grand National” Daniels said. “I’ve been dreaming of this my whole life. It’s been a long road for me and the team. Those guys have worked their butts off. It’s been a long road since they started and I know this is so rewarding for them.

“Taking my dad on that victory lap… I’ve been talking about that since I was like eight years old. We did it… It’s awesome!”

Rispoli held on for third to become the first Mission Production Twins Challenge rider to land on the Mission SuperTwins podium and add to what was already an incredible debut for the WBR KTM.

Robinson came home fourth followed by another Mission Production Twins Challenge pilot in Ben Lowe (No. 25 Mission Foods/Roof Systems Yamaha MT-07) to complete the top five.

Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) was sixth followed by an uncharacteristically quiet Briar Bauman (No. 3 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750). Davis Fisher (No. 67 Bob Lanphere’s BMC Racing Indian FTR750) Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) and Robert Pearson (No. 27 Rackley Racing/John Franklin Indian FTR750) rounded out the top ten.

Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

If anyone forgot just how dominant James Rispoli (No. 43 Wally Brown Racing/Haversack KTM 890 Duke) was at times when he won the 2020 Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines championship he provided a most compelling reminder on Saturday night.

Rispoli made his return to the class at the Red Mile to debut the WBR KTM 890 Duke and did so in style. He not only made the bike a winner he did so in runaway fashion leading from start to finish.

The only rider who even managed to keep him honest was Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R). Janisch clung on behind him just outside the draft but he never managed to present a realistic challenge to Rispoli’s position at the front.

After claiming the win Rispoli said “The Wally Brown Racing team has a wealth of experience. They’re smart guys. We took the common sense route and they built a phenomenal package. KTM built a great platform but these guys found a way to get that horsepower to the ground. I’m so pumped. I’m stoked to return to Mission Production Twins and to win? I’m stoked.”

While Rispoli may have had a drama-free run to victory the battle for the final spot on the podium was most entertaining. A tight five-rider pack made up of the returning Michael Rush (No. 15 Hellipower Racing/Las Vegas Harley-Davidson XG750R) Ryan Varnes (No. 68 Schaeffer’s Motorsports/Rausch Fuel & Oil KTM 890 Duke) Ben Lowe (No. 25 Mission Foods/Roof Systems Yamaha MT-07) Cory Texter (No. 1 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07) and Nick Armstrong (No. 60 Competitive Racing Frames/Lessley Brothers Yamaha MT-07).

Among a great deal of shuffling points leader Armstrong systematically made his way from seventh to third but went off the groove and dropped right back to seventh erasing all his hard work.

Defending champion Texter did what he does and emerged late as he and Lowe scrapped for third over the final two laps. Ultimately Texter took the position by 0.122 to further a three-race podium streak. However he’s still three points back of Armstrong in the championship chase after Armstrong clawed his way back up to fifth at the flag.

Varnes finished sixth with Rush taking seventh a welcome result in his return ride after suffering a serious leg injury in last year’s finale.

Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER

Combining the Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER class and a big Mile racetrack is typically the recipe for an ultra-tight pack war. Saturday’s showdown was no exception.

As many as eight riders were in with a shot for victory deep into the race before a couple of them went off the groove leaving a six-rider shootout on the race’s final lap.

The on-form Morgen Mischler (No. 13 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) did his best to control the chaotic affair from the front and it paid off with a 0.053 seconds margin of victory.

While Mischler regularly traded the lead with teammate Dalton Gauthier (No. 79 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) for much of the contest the final sprint came down to him title rival Kody Kopp (No. 12 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) and Trent Lowe (No. 48 Mission Foods/Al Lamb’s Dallas Honda CRF450R).

Mischler opened the final lap in the lead and made the most of his Honda’s horsepower to just fend off his challengers.

The win was Mischler’s first ever on a Mile as he continues to increasingly prove himself a well-rounded title contender. He said “The puzzle pieces are fitting and I see us just getting better with everything the team has been putting into it. For me it’s just a matter of me doing my job.”

Despite just missing out on the win Kopp continues to lead the championship on the strength of an early season that has seen him finish no worse than second.

Kopp’s teammate Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) finished off the podium for the first time this season with a fourth-place effort. Gauthier who is dealing with a partially torn ACL and MCL finished fifth while Trevor Brunner (No. 21 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) finished sixth just 0.420 seconds off the win despite being forced to start from the back of the pack after using a provisional start to earn a spot in the Main.

It is also a structural breakdown of the way in which neoliberalism has historically attempted to legitimise its own regime of accumulation. According to one framing of the debate while the Rajapaksa regime is going backward neoliberal elements within the Opposition embrace a forward-looking agenda. But both represent two provisional attempts to resolve the problems generated by the neoliberal regime without necessarily transforming it in a deeper structural sense.

In the case of the Rajapaksa regime it is attempting to borrow from a heterodox policy toolkit while preserving the basic conditions of private sector-led accumulation that have characterised the neoliberal regime. Meanwhile elements within the Opposition propose a radicalisation of free market reforms to achieve the same goal. Both the Rajapaksa regime and this segment of the Opposition seek to reform the system to restore it although they take different approaches.

Yet in a moment where the “old is dying and the new cannot be born” the system itself must undergo transformation lest it generate the morbid symptoms to which Gramsci famously referred. In the dialectic of struggle between regime and opposition there is the possibility that potentially fascist elements empowered by the regime could displace it and ultimately claim to provide a more radical solution to these intractable problems. Ultra-nationalists may attempt to appropriate the discourse of self-sufficiency. Meanwhile if the Opposition takes power by pursuing an even more aggressive neoliberal approach it could initially attempt to legitimise itself in terms of the mandate given by the International Monetary Fund IMF

International Monetary Fund Along with the World Bank the IMF was founded on the day the Bretton Woods Agreements were signed. Its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates.



When the Bretton Wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the IMF became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital: it acts as policeman when it enforces its Structural Adjustment Policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments.



As for the World Bank a weighted voting system operates: depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state. 85% of the votes is required to modify the IMF Charter (which means that the USA with 1768% % of the votes has a de facto veto on any change).



The institution is dominated by five countries: the United States (1674%) Japan (623%) Germany (581%) France (429%) and the UK (429%).

The other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country. The most important one (657% of the votes) is led by Belgium. The least important group of countries (155% of the votes) is led by Gabon and brings together African countries.



http://imf.org (IMF) or other external actors. But it would still impose severe costs on the public.

Accordingly once in government the current Opposition would be unable to reconstruct the bases of its own hegemony or at the very least it would be severely constrained in its space for manœuvre because of its willing subordination to external forces. The fascist solution would also eventually acquire power in this scenario albeit on a more uncertain timeline. Of course the fascist solution has its own limitations precisely because of the dependent nature of Sri Lanka’s economy its increasing subordination to external powers with their own geopolitical interests potential domestic resistance along cross-ethnic lines and so on. All these factors must be considered. But they beg the question: what is the alternative?

Today the question for the Left is not about how as in Britain in the 1970s we transform an existing social democratic State that has reached its limits (Hall 1980). Instead it is: how do we create an entirely new progressive regime? Often this question invokes pre-existing notions including stereotyped attributes such as a robust welfare system mixed economy characterised by State intervention in strategic sectors and so on. But if we are willing to push ourselves the crisis in Sri Lanka means taking seriously the fundamental re-envisioning of the hegemonic bloc that is materialised in the State. The challenge requires first explaining why the crisis of neoliberalism has erupted and the way in which neoliberals themselves interpret the crisis.

The Discursive Shift within Neoliberalism

The question of what constitutes neoliberalism has been asked so many times that by this point it may feel stale. Rather than try to suppress the concept however by exploring contradictions in its articulation as an ideology by specific actors—regardless of whether they themselves self-identify as neoliberals—we can better understand what its failings are. This approach can enable us to ask what is required to transcend its fundamental inability to resolve the current crisis.

Of course there is no monolithic body of neoliberal thinking. It is the shifting expression of a network of experts. It is constantly being reformulated to emphasise different elements in its constellation though its overall direction remains to assert the domination of the market over society. By engaging with the discourse however we can reconstruct a general shift in thinking: from a perception of the process of reform as a necessary component of Sri Lanka’s economic growth since the inauguration of the ‘open economy’ in 1977 to the contemporary argument that reform itself has not been taken up with sufficient vigour.

Initially neoliberalism was confident of its success in redefining the terrain of debate. As Athukorala and Rajapatirana (2000) put it in a representative text “Following 2 decades of reforms Sri Lanka today stands out as one of the most open economies in the developing world. This basic policy orientation seems set to continue in the foreseeable future” (546). The authors writing during the global apex of neoliberalism in the late 1990s and early 2000s asserted that whatever administration came to power in Sri Lanka could only accelerate the process.

Athukorala and Rajapatirana identified key variables to explain why the open economy was successful on the terms they set forth including the apparent growth of the export-oriented manufacturing sector. According to them “The promotion of foreign investment particularly in export-oriented manufacturing has been a pivotal element of Sri Lanka’s market-oriented policy reforms since 1977” (550).

They further identified the core features of the investment-promotion policy package offered by the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC)—which later became the Board of Investment (BOI)—to Export Processing Zone (EPZ) investors. It notably “[allowed] complete foreign ownership of investment projects; a tax holiday for up to 10 years with complete tax exemption for remuneration of foreign personnel royalties and dividends of shareholders during that period; duty exemption for the import of inputs and assistance with customs clearances; industrial services at subsidised rates; and unlimited access to foreign currency credit at interest rates Interest rates When A lends money to B B repays the amount lent by A (the capital) as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that A has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation. The interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low. To take a very simple example: if A borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5% the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed (10 million dollars) plus 5% of the capital owed i.e. 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars. In the second year he will again repay 10% of the capital borrowed but the 5% now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i.e. 4.5 million dollars or a total of 14.5 million dollars. And so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5% of that remaining 10 million dollars i.e. 0.5 million dollars giving a total of 10.5 million dollars. Over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127.5 million dollars. The repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments. In the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years. In this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher…



The nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted. The real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation. prevailing in world financial markets” (550).

In the present moment however neoliberalism’s policy prescriptions have shifted in response to the growing contradictions within this process. As Mick Moore (2017) for example has demonstrated “institutionalised pressure for tax exemptions” contributed to the hollowing out of Sri Lanka’s revenue base which helped create the fiscal crisis we observe today (13). Yet for the neoliberal elements within the contemporary Opposition the primary culprit remains unsustainable State expenditure.

Among representative actors the Advocata Institute for example has come out with successive statements blaming the crisis on the Rajapaksa regime’s attempts to impose price controls and import restrictions along with continued support for a bloated public sector and inefficient State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). These elements however require a systematic form of explanation. They are in fact attempts however ineffective to restore rather than overcome the overall direction of the neoliberal economy. The Rajapaksa regime is trying to manage the most severe impacts of the crisis on different constituencies whose support is critical to its political survival.

Given the massive scale of the crisis of course the emergency measures that the regime pursues are inevitably insufficient. In some cases they may even be strategic miscalculations. For example the fertiliser ban. Failed attempts at price controls and import restrictions are part of the current regime’s hesitant and muddled response to the crisis.

The confusion is embedded in the fact that the regime itself does not want to break with the fundamental model of private sector-led accumulation that has characterised the economy since 1977. This reluctance is evidenced both by its initial expansion of tax concessions and more recently its manoeuvring within the budget to ply investors with more incentives. Perhaps the most obvious example is the way in which easy money has fuelled stock market speculation without incentivising investment in critical areas such as food production.

These immediate responses to the crisis aside neoliberals have also redoubled their critique of long-standing institutions that mediate the relationship between State and society. Public sector employment and SOEs are at the core of the neoliberal ideological assault on the Rajapaksa regime’s alleged failure to implement necessary reforms. Accordingly the narrative has shifted from the exhilarating days when Athukorala and Rajapatirana could claim all governments in Sri Lanka had adopted major elements of the neoliberal consensus to sombre attempts to identify the reversal of this process around the time the Rajapaksas first came to power in 2005 under Mahinda.

So for example Advocata has argued that “The present macroeconomic instability lies in the failure of the state to implement deep structural reforms to the economy for nearly twenty years. The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed Sri Lanka’s fundamental weaknesses that have plagued the economy for a long period of time.”

Why Neoliberals Can’t Explain the Crisis of Neoliberalism

The contemporary attempt to bifurcate the open economy into good and bad phases however fails to comprehend two dimensions necessary for analysing the crisis: the relationship between financialisation and the political legitimacy of the State. In terms of the first issue the consequences of the intersecting crises of “twin deficits” (meaning the budget and the current account) are the expression of a longer structural trend. The rise of neoliberalism and the reduction of State revenues are inter-related. Specifically revenue as a proportion of GDP GDP

Gross Domestic Product Gross Domestic Product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added. The measure is notoriously incomplete; for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange. The GDP takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services. Economic growth is defined as the variation of the GDP from one period to another. declined from 20 to 13 per cent over a nearly 20-year period from 1995 to 2014 (Moore 2017: 6).

This process eventually forced the State to look for other sources to finance its expenditure—namely dollar-denominated loans—while bilateral and multilateral donors that offered concessional funding exited over time. Or as Moore notes “… Until 1977 the fiscal deficit averaged just under a third of government revenue collection; after 1977 it averaged just over half. And it remained there even after aid levels began to decline” (18-19). Once finance capital became dominant some slowly began to recognise what others had already been pointing out which is that it was cannibalising the system.

A wider global debate about the extent to which financialisation is the necessary outcome of neoliberalism continues. As Fine (2014) puts it:

A crucial point is that despite its ideology neoliberalism is not about the withdrawal of state (economic) intervention; it has always been associated with a strong not a weak state and an authoritarian one as opposed to one that upholds personal liberties. On the contrary the distinguishing role of the (advanced) neoliberal state has primarily been to promote the interests and internationalization of capital in general and of finance in particular an important example being the extent that state finance itself has been financialized. (58)

Fine alludes to the example of the US bailout of the banks during the Great Recession of 2008. But the same broad argument can be applied to Sri Lanka. The regime of Mahinda Rajapaksa began issuing sovereign bonds in 2007; a perfect example of State finance becoming financialised.

The deeper logic is that Sri Lanka has had to issue more and more debt because the proposed benefits of globalisation have failed to materialise in a sustainable overall balance of payments Balance of payments A country’s balance of current payments is the result of its commercial transactions (i.e. imported and exported goods and services) and its financial exchanges with foreign countries. The balance of payments is a measure of the financial position of a country vis-à-vis the rest of the world. A country with a surplus in its current payments is a lending country for the rest of the world. On the other hand if a country’s balance is in the red that country will have to turn to the international lenders to meet its funding needs. . Attributing this squeeze solely to the political choices of the regimes since 2005 evades the core questions of why finance capital has expanded across the globe to seek out speculative opportunities and why it became attractive to successive regimes as a way of bridging the import/export gap.

This process intersects with the second dimension of the problem which is the political legitimacy that a regime of accumulation requires. By attacking State spending in general the contemporary crop of neoliberals completely misunderstands the way in which the current Rajapaksa regime for example remains embedded within the logic of neoliberalism. Although the State sustains and perhaps even increases spending in specific areas such as public sector employment this does not imply a rejection of neoliberalism. Rather it is merely one element in its continuation. It may help create the necessary political stability such as a regime extending its networks of patronage. In this regard during the current moment the regime of Gotabaya Rajapaksa is desperately trying to hold on despite growing fiscal pressure.

Meanwhile the historical trend has been that most people continue to experience overwhelmingly precarious livelihoods; a process in which inequality has become even more entrenched. In contrast to the neoliberals some explicitly attempting to give ideological cover to the current regime celebrate its rhetoric and strategies as an example of the ways in which it is not neoliberal. But by ignoring the structural ways in which neoliberalism overdetermines the State in general they implicitly accept the simplistic neoliberal framing of the ‘market’ as opposed to the ‘State’. In contrast there is a much longer tradition of scholarship that explains why it has been impossible for neoliberalism to appear in unalloyed form.

It helps to look to an earlier period to reinterpret this question to bracket the terms of the current debate in which neoliberalism apparently can only be understood in relation to the Rajapaksas’ political choices. Herring (1987) for example identified the ways in which Sri Lanka could initially avoid the shock of economic liberalisation because the IMF and World Bank World Bank

WB The World Bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at Bretton Woods in 1944. Its capital is provided by member states’ contributions and loans on the international money markets. It financed public and private projects in Third World and East European countries.



It consists of several closely associated institutions among which :



1. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD 189 members in 2017) which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy ;



2. The International Development Association (IDA 159 members in 1997) which provides less advanced countries with long-term loans (35-40 years) at very low interest (1%) ;



3. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries.



As Third World Debt gets worse the World Bank (along with the IMF) tends to adopt a macro-economic perspective. For instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries’ payments. The World Bank advises those countries that have to undergo the IMF’s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates.



were willing to accommodate its expansionary fiscal policy. But that leeway ended by the early 1980s. Subsequently increasing fiscal pressure led to privatisations and attempts to cut various subsidies which provoked further popular responses including contributing to the defeat of the United National Party (UNP) in 1994. This dialectic of neoliberal reform and resistance continues to evolve.

Neoliberal thinking however has tended to ignore or dismiss the question of the balance Balance End of year statement of a company’s assets (what the company possesses) and liabilities (what it owes). In other words the assets provide information about how the funds collected by the company have been used; and the liabilities about the origins of those funds. of class forces. It stands in stark contrast with the predominant mode of political science scholarship on Sri Lanka that has attempted to explain why the masses did or did not revolt in key moments. For example Athukorala and Rajapatirana (2000) initially proposed that “In a decisive move to infuse momentum into the unfinished reform process a significant second-wave liberalisation package was implemented in 1990” (546). But they avoided a political economic explanation of why neoliberalism was forced to take a step back in response to popular pressure.

Samarasinghe (1994) commenting on the 1994 election results identified several reasons for the switch from the previous UNP government to the People’s Alliance (PA) including the fact that “Two PA election promises were particularly attractive to the farmers: restoration of the fertiliser subsidy for rice farmers that was withdrawn in 1990 under World Bank pressure and the writing off of outstanding farm loans held by banks and provision of interest Interest An amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender. Interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set. -free loans from the banks in the future” (1028). Within this type of explanation there is space to engage with the question of the ways in which a hegemonic bloc secures the basis of a political regime.

The takeaway is that since consolidating its victory throughout the 1980s and 1990s neoliberalism has exhausted itself as an ideological process capable of explaining its own ability to work on popular sentiments to exploit the contradictions within a pre-existing system. Instead convinced of its own success in dismantling the social democratic State it became incapable of explaining the emerging tensions within its own bloc. In the current moment it works itself into a frenzy by demanding that its proposals take tactical precedence in framing the Opposition’s political attack on the Rajapaksa regime. But it has simultaneously abandoned the strategic challenge of reconstructing its bloc.

The Progressive Alternative

Ultimately what this contradiction implies is the fundamental political instability of any future regime that attempts to embrace neoliberal prescriptions. Political leaders among the Opposition may attempt to moderate their approach and restrain the most extreme free market factions within their broad coalition. They may talk of expanding targeted safety nets and maintaining social welfare. But the reality is that given the tremendous scale of the crisis they will ultimately be forced to make a fundamental choice in terms of whether to restore or revolutionise the current system. The stakes of the crisis do not allow for an inoffensive ‘national consensus’. Instead they demand a clear articulation of whether to transform the existing system.

The primary axis of differentiation is whether Sri Lanka will radically restructure its imports or whether it will continue to fall prey to the neoliberal illusion of global market integration via the reciprocal expansion of imports and exports. The latter dynamic would supposedly allow the country to escape the debt trap by exploiting its comparative advantage. The past 45 years of the open economy however cannot be drawn up in terms of a favourable balance sheet for this project.

The crisis has come to a head. The question now is whether the ongoing neoliberal attempt to reproduce and extend this crisis into the foreseeable future can be politically sustained. The determining factor is the direction toward which Sri Lanka’s elites will swing in response to the breakdown of existing patterns of accumulation and popular resistance.

Meanwhile for the Left to play its part in constructing an alternative progressive bloc that can sustain a regime over the long term it must clarify its purpose. As stated at the beginning unlike the crisis of the 1970s the question before us now is not how to push past the limits of the social democratic State. Instead it is the question of how we create a new type of progressive regime.

To pursue this idea we must replace the problematique of the transition to an inevitable endpoint—historically Communism—by recognising a plurality of different paths to social transformation. Past debates within the Left often assumed the technological transformation of society—or the linear development of the forces of production—within which the narrower more instrumental question of the relationship between the State and the autonomous organisations of the working class was posed.

But we must now acknowledge that as much as we want to revolutionise the current system this project must not imply the revolution as the ultimate expression of a “technocratic utopia based on domination of nature women and colonies” (Mies 2014: 216). The specific historical arrangements and contradictions that emerge will depend on who pushes and how. We can strengthen the ideological framing of this struggle. We cannot however anticipate the series of transformations that will ultimately lead to the transcendence of capitalism. We must maintain the latter in terms of broad perspective given capitalism’s own tendency to dismantle its compromises. This process creates the conditions for further crises that inevitably undermine capitalism’s legitimacy. But we must also recognise the need to pluralise our own imagination of what society could become.

This is where the question of what it means to radically restructure imports takes on a far deeper significance than an alternative understood in narrow economic terms. If we talk about substituting food imports for example how would it shape people’s habits and diets including the potential impact of a public distribution system? If we talk about reducing oil imports a proxy for energy consumption how would this require changes in the design of the built environment and public transportation? If we talk about reducing pharmaceutical imports how would this generate new questions about ways in which to remove pressures within people’s livelihoods including confronting the social determinants of health?

There is no easy technocratic solution to this set of problems. But a response need not be conceived in terms of harsh restriction of people’s consumption. It could instead provoke creative thinking about alternatives. Above all this process hinges on the forms of engagement between intellectuals and masses to analyse problems in the concrete circumstances of people’s lives and the balance of forces within which solutions are adopted.

Ultimately then the crisis of neoliberalism and the need to envision a new type of progressive regime are a massive task for the Left for which there are no pre-existing answers. But by pushing the limits of thought to consider the precise extent of the crisis and what it implies for the overall transformation of the system we can propose truly radical solutions that could reconstruct the State on more egalitarian grounds. This includes specifying the relationship between the State and community organisations such as cooperatives. We must recognise for example that there is nothing inherently better (or worse) about centralised versus decentralised production; a debate for example that has long been taken up by heterodox thinkers.

Instead these are relational questions that we must pose and interpret in a non-economistic way including by asking the ways in which they intersect with caste gender and other modes of social power. Within an alternative hegemonic arrangement elites will identify opportunities for accumulation and thus come to their own accommodation with the new status quo. We cannot anticipate the exact outline of the society that emerges at the end of this process. But there is also hope. Insofar as neoliberalism is unable to solve the crisis it has created we now have an opportunity to radically reorient the entire debate about what is possible beyond its narrow strictures.

Mabli Siriol Jones

On International Women’s Day 2018 First Minister Carwyn Jones declared his ambition to make the Welsh Government a ‘Feminist Government’.

Commenting on the ambition he said there was ‘no point politicians being able to see a difference … members of the public need to see that something positive is being done to their lives’.

The reality since devolution however is that the various commitments and policy initiatives towards gender equality have had minimal material impact on most women’s lives.

This is because politics and policymaking in Wales are captured by the neoliberal consensus and feminism as practised by the political class is no exception.

The feminism that has been dominant in Welsh public life as in the UK and other western states is a neoliberal feminism aiming for the advancement of individual women within the existing neoliberal framework rather than a genuinely emancipatory project committed to dismantling that framework and securing justice for all.

Nancy Fraser argues that the hegemonic political worldview in western states over recent decades has been progressive neoliberalism.

This is defined as a political consensus combining a neoliberal politics of distribution (financialisaton deregulation and privatisation) with a progressive politics of recognition (increased social status for oppressed groups such as women LGBT people and people of colour).

Reformist approach

Fraser argues that in order for neoliberalism to become truly hegemonic in states shaped by the post-war economic consensus and the social movements of the 1960s it needed the gloss of progressive recognition politics.

This combination allowed neoliberalism to triumph and it has dominated since.

It is only recently following the financial crisis that this consensus has begun to shatter with the rise of outsider populist politics on the right and left.

As Fraser identifies feminism has played a large part in this project of progressive neoliberalism.

This is due in part to the unwitting perversion of some of its central tenets and in part to the championing of a certain kind of feminism by privileged women based on their personal advancement relative to men of their own class.

Feminism has become in Fraser’s words the ‘handmaiden’ of neoliberalism which ‘turns a sow’s ear into a silk purse by elaborating a narrative of female empowerment’.

Neoliberal feminism is characterised by a reformist approach to existing social structures seeking the advancement of individual women within those structures rather than fundamental change for all.

It is therefore pre-occupied with representation having women in visible leadership positions within high status workplaces such as politics the media and boardrooms. Its agent is the individual and her empowerment rather than the collective.

It locates oppression primarily in the interpersonal rather than the structural.

It operates by ‘raising awareness’ and attempting to change attitudes and behaviours rather than the material conditions and social relations that give rise to them.

It is process-oriented and imagines that inequality can be tackled by changing institutions’ procedures rather than questioning the power imbalances inherent in those institutions themselves.

Its theory of change rests on the assumption that promoting more women into positions of power will lead to improvements in everyone else’s lives – a ‘trickle-down feminism’ mirroring the trickle-down economics of neoliberalism.

Analysis of power

Crucially it does not have an analysis of power itself – a word that is usually absent from its lexicon which prefers the language of ‘equality’ ‘diversity’ and ‘inclusion’.

It situates the achievement of feminist aims in the actions of a benevolent state that will (someday if we get the right people into power) address the needs and concerns of women.

Above all in Fraser’s terms it prioritises recognition over redistribution: changing attitudes and women’s social status rather than the allocation of wealth power and resources.

Neoliberal feminism speaks to the concerns of a class of women for whom being a feminist becomes another lifestyle label rather than a political praxis; a way to prove one’s progressive credentials while securing one’s own advancement.

These are predominantly wealthy white middle-class able-bodied cisgender and heterosexual women; women who benefit from existing social structures despite the disadvantages they encounter due to their gender.

They therefore tend to privilege gendered oppression above other forms as that is the only or primary oppression they experience. This is nothing new. The history of mainstream feminism is one of exclusions and the use of feminism to secure the class position of certain women relative to their male counterparts.

Neoliberalism has been able to use feminism because these schisms already existed.

Women at the top have long been content to secure their own position at the expense and by using the labour of working-class women often drawn from communities of colour and the Global South.

As a result the primary political purpose of neoliberal feminism unwi-tingly or not is to reinforce neoliberalism as the dominant mode of ordering society by giving it a progressive veneer.

The truth is there will never be equality for women (or any oppressed group) under neoliberalism as it is a system based on the exploitation of women’s unpaid labour and tearing apart the social fabric within which women’s material conditions can be improved and where the comfort and wealth of some comes at the expense of many others.

Yet as Fraser notes the neoliberal consensus is fracturing everywhere.

Feminism must ask itself what its role will be in what takes its place.

Neoliberal Feminism in Wales

Wales has been radically reshaped and deeply scarred by neoliberalism and its processes of deindustrialisation austerity and privatisation.

As Gabriel Winant has noted it is those who bear the brunt of neoliberalism who also have to manage its consequences particularly women in working-class communities deindustrialised areas and communities of colour.

As neoliberalism destroys the notion of the collective and cuts back on social provision women experience increasing poverty and precarity and have to pick up the pieces through unpaid care and the feminised workforces of the caring professions.

This is illustrated by the fact that 86% of the reductions in public spending through cuts to welfare and tax changes under austerity came from women.

One in four people in Wales lives in poverty and for single parents (90% of whom are women) the figure is 44%.

Women are more likely to be in insecure employment and 41% work part time.

They make up the bulk of the workforce in the caring professions as 80% of workers in health and social work and 66% of the education workforce.

They are therefore on the frontlines of managing the vicious circle of increased need and reduced capacity in public services due to cuts privatisation and the inequality and human misery generated by neoliberalism.

In a country with an ageing population and high levels of disability and long-term illness they also provide the bulk of unpaid care doing 60% more unpaid care work than men and making up 59% of those providing family care.

The Covid-19 pandemic and recession have exacerbated all these issues and underlying structural trends – economic social demographic – mean they will only intensify in future.

Short on detail

Yet 20 years of devolved policy on gender equality has prioritised recognition over redistribution and attempted with little success to manage the impact of neoliberalism on women’s lives.

Due to the focus on recognition over redistribution the framework for ‘equalities’ policy under neoliberal governance is to treat it as an area apart with little influence on major policy areas.

The Welsh Government is typical in this regard. The approach is incrementalist managerialist and focused on processes with the neoliberal tendency to generate new forms of bureaucracy with little real value.

The language used reflects the managerialist approach: people have ‘protected characteristics’ they are ‘stakeholders’ or ‘service users’.

Policy interventions tend towards creating new procedures training programmes and awareness-raising campaigns as was evident in the response by Senedd politicians to the Me Too revelations of sexual harassment in politics.

The actions taken concentrated on awareness-raising strengthening complaints procedures and ‘Dignity and Respect’ policies without a deeper reckoning or acknowledgement that these would be inadequate in a workplace with vast and inherent power imbalances and limited labour rights.

The rhetoric on gender equality does not match the reality as demonstrated by the government’s Advancing Gender Equality in Wales Plan on how it will fulfil the feminist government ambition.

While accepting the need for far-reaching change the plan is short on detail light on action heavy with managerialist language and focused on instituting new processes rather than substantive policy change.

Painfully slow

Meanwhile the government’s flagship gender equality legislation has also fallen short.

The Violence Against Women Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence Act was heralded as ‘world-leading’ when it was introduced in 2015 but its interventions focus on training and procedures and implementation has been painfully slow. Funding of the sector is piecemeal and short-term provision is patchy and services are stretched.

Austerity has made women both more vulnerable to abuse and less able to access support – what’s needed above all is significant investment in the sector.

This failure has a human cost: in 2019–20 574 people were turned away from domestic abuse services and 251 were on waiting lists for rape crisis support.

A common thread through the missed opportunities to materially advance gender equality is a lack of class analysis and aversion to redistribution.

The Welsh Government’s Childcare Offer which funds 30 hours of childcare to working parents of 3 and 4-year-olds is a key example.

Parents who aren’t in work are excluded with the result that the offer benefits some of Wales’ wealthiest families while giving nothing to the poorest.

Anti-poverty organisations opposition politicians and the Children’s Commissioner called for the offer to be extended to all parents but the government refused to change direction.

The episode demonstrated how deeply wedded the government is to neoliberal doctrine including the aversion to universalism increasing conditionality in welfare and public services and the belief in work as the route out of poverty and a good in itself.

This thinking has also been evident in its opposition to the devolution of welfare administration despite the fact this would allow it to offset some of the harmful elements of Universal Credit such as allowing payments to more than one member of the household rather than the current primary earner policy that leaves women financially dependent on their spouses and more vulnerable to abuse.

Likewise the government’s refusal to move away from the current model of for-profit social care provision towards a universal and free publicly owned service shows a lack of understanding of the material benefit this would have to women who as well as providing the majority of unpaid care make up 83% of workers in a sector where low pay precarity and exploitation are widespread.

‘Sex work’

This lack of class analysis is also behind much of main-stream feminism’s approach to sex work with an inability to understand sex work as work and the material realities that lead people to sell sex.

This includes support from gender equality organisations and politicians for the ‘Nordic model’ that criminalises the purchase of sex rather than decriminalisation and labour rights for sex workers.

The Nordic model makes sex workers less safe and rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of what drives a lot of sex work – which is sex workers’ need to make money.

This has led to bizarre alliances including the Welsh Government backing the introduction of equivalent legislation in the UK to a Trump administration law that shut down sex work websites and drove workers underground into more dangerous practices.

Contrasted with the lack of a focus on redistribution is the fixation on representation in discussions of gender equality since devolution.

Much has been made of the fact that the Senedd was one of the first parliaments in the world to achieve 50/50 representation in 2003.

A Cardiff University study is often cited for the claim that this made for better policy development noting women were more likely to raise gender equality issues.

Yet as the examples given above show it is not clear that this has led to improved outcomes for most women.

The drive for 50/50 representation has continued however with the Expert Panel on Assembly Electoral Reform recommending in 2017 that the Senedd introduce a legal quota to ensure 50% of representatives would be women and 50% men.

This was welcomed despite the perverse implication that Wales would therefore be introducing a ceiling on women’s representation and ensuring protected seats for men.

It is a fallacy to assume that women are naturally kinder more level-headed and ethical actors in positions of leadership.

It is a particularly bizarre claim in a country whose social safety net was unpicked most radically by its first female prime minister and whose second created the hostile environment.

To argue otherwise is to accept that women are somehow not full political actors in the same way as men – people who can advance a range of political projects and their own interests in positions of power.

Any discussion of women and power that neglects an analysis of power itself – or treats it as a neutral sphere a tool that is wielded better somehow by women – is inherently superficial and flawed.

History shows that women are just as capable as men of upholding oppressive systems where they benefit from those systems themselves.

Structural barriers

It is of course essential that women participate fully in decision-making structures and it is obvious that is not currently happening.

This is not adequately addressed however by the suppositions of a feminism that focuses on representation to the detriment of other issues and talks more about the sexism female politicians face than the structural barriers that shut others out. Quotas do not solve a problem at its root they just put in place mechanisms at the end of a system to change its output.

They therefore mainly benefit women who are already near the top of these systems and the issues these women are more likely to care about or understand will reflect their own experiences and class position.

These mechanisms will not necessarily lead to improvements in most people’s lives as they leave unaddressed the question of who will be put in power and what they will do with it.

They do not address deeper questions of how power is distributed and wielded or advocate for real democratisation of institutions that disenfranchise the majority.

Wales’ ‘progressive consensus’ has often been lauded but it is precisely on those issues where that consensus appears to be most well-established that political commitment is at its most shallow.

Politics is the field of contestation and consensus achieved without contestation tends to be around quite hollow ideals as they are those that do not represent a threat to the established order.

Political consensus around ‘gender equality’ amounts to a general idea that equality (ill-defined and broadly conceived) is a good thing and few policies go beyond increased representation.

Demands for redistributive policies are dismissed and ‘gender equality’ and ‘feminism’ become floating signifiers empty of the commitments that would make them transformative.

Anti-feminist

This shallow consensus has meant that Welsh politics and mainstream feminism has been inadequately prepared to answer the challenge from the growth of anti-feminist

politics.

This has been evident in the fifth Senedd with the election of more than one representative who has endorsed the ideas and language of the alt-right; the backlash to the Me Too movement and the use of anti-feminism in the Plaid Cymru leadership election with the claim that Leanne Wood was too focused on the ‘niche issues’ of the oppressed.

Reactionary politics feeds off the wounds and resentments generated by neoliberalism telling those for whom progressive neoliberalism has failed to secure improvements in their lives that it is its politics of recognition not redistribution that is to blame.

The answer from neoliberal feminism tends to be dismissal or ridicule as it struggles to articulate a more robust defence of its programme that has after all neglected redistributive policies that would have a material benefit to men as well as women. Wales has many characteristics that make it fertile ground for reactionary political currents: a small and exclusive political class low levels of political engagement and a weak media and public sphere.

The response to anti-feminism which is often at the vanguard of reactionary political projects does not bode well for the response to other reactionary projects in future including the growing anti-devolution movement.

The Welsh political class appears ill-equipped to meet these challenges or even understand them.

Towards an Alternative Feminism

We live in a moment of deepening and cross-cutting crises lived every day in the experiences of those in our society who cannot insulate themselves through wealth. Neoliberal feminism cannot help when you are unable to feed your children without the aid of a food bank shafted from one underpaid job to another and navigating the cruel and arcane processes of decimated public services.

Where are these women in the narratives and concerns of neoliberal feminism?

Its women tend to be those who have risen to the top or the girls who need encouragement that with hard work they can get there too.

When working-class or marginalised women appear it is usually as an afterthought or in a paternalistic frame that presents middle-class liberal feminists as their saviours.

They are never agents in their own right nor comrades in struggle. They are women to be ‘empowered’ by their benevolent feminist leaders not people who find ways to survive resist and even triumph within a system engineered against them.

Neoliberal feminism will never lead to emancipation because it precludes the only way we get there – through struggle together.

We urgently need to rebuild feminist politics on a different foundation. This should be based on a fundamental rejection of neoliberalism and reclaiming the collective good.

This feminism must centre an analysis of power: how it works who has it and what they do with it.

Rather than ‘equality’ ‘inclusion’ and ‘diversity’ we need to talk about dismantling and sharing power and wielding it for our own ends.

Margin to centre

We must work in the words of bell hooks ‘from margin to centre’ starting from the needs of the most marginalised. The woman imprisoned for protecting herself from her abuser; the woman made destitute by our immigration system; the woman turning to sex work due to the inadequacy of Universal Credit.

This is a feminism that would talk less about promoting individual women within institutions and more about transforming those institutions to serve the rest of us. This is not a feminism that can be generated or led by politicians or NGOs; it must be built from the ground up as part of a project to democratise society.

While rejecting progressive neoliberalism we must also reject a certain brand of leftism that dismisses ‘identity politics’ and says the rights of women and marginalised people are ‘distractions’ from the only true struggle class struggle.

This dismisses decades of Marxist thought on gender race and imperialism as well as the needs of working-class people who experience multiple forms of op-pression. As Fraser reminds us justice requires both recognition and redistribution.

This means a real commitment to intersectionality and situating feminism within a broader movement for social economic and climate justice.

It is feminism as a project for the redistribution of wealth and power and socialism that puts feminism anti-racism and anti-imperialism at its heart understanding that there is no liberation for some without liberation for all.

Radical activism

Despite the ravages of neoliberalism a long tradition of communitarianism and radical activism still exists in Wales.

A truly feminist government would use this to reject the neoliberal consensus and reorientate the economy and society around care – the antithesis of neoliberal economics.

The confrontation between capital and the stubborn human need for care has been brought to the fore by the Covid-19 pandemic and will only increase with current trends.

The caring professions were on the frontlines of Covid-19 with the pandemic exposing both the damage of decades of neoliberal reforms to these services and that they are the true creators of value in our society.

Reproductive labour of all kinds has been undervalued precisely because it is done for free by women and is one of capitalism’s foundational sites of exploitation. Yet care is resistant to automation and our need for it will only grow.

This need should be met by high-quality universal services not unpaid labour and for-profit provision.

Rejecting neoliberalism and centring a politics of care can help us weave together the commitments and solidarities we need to build an alternative.

The neoliberal order is fragmenting and what takes its place is undecided.

As Fraser argues this can lead to ever more reactionary politics or a progressive project for recognition and redistribution.

Neoliberal feminism has shown itself incapable of delivering justice. Drawing on a rich counter current of feminist scholarship and activism we must turn to something else – a political project working for the liberation of all women from violence and exploitation within a wider movement for a radically different society one based on the realisation of care dignity and joy for all.

We need a different kind of feminism that will demand and win much more.

Ebbene si per gli appassionati della street art non servirà prendere un volo per New York o Londra basterà recarsi un po’ più a sud.

A 1 ORA da Milano la PIÙ GRANDE GALLERIA di URBAN ART a cielo aperto al mondo

# Tutto può trasformarsi in arte anche un parco logistico

Lo scorso settembre è stato inaugurato il “Prologis Park Lodi” il primo parco logistico ad ospitare una galleria di urban art a cielo aperto. Non solo. Si tratta della più grande mai realizzata a livello mondiale.

A ideare il parco sono stati Prologis il leader mondiale nel settore immobiliare e CEVA Logistics uno dei principali operatori logistici caratterizzato da una strategia non-asset based.

L’obiettivo era cercare un modo per valorizzare gli edifici e il parco creando una migliore integrazione dell’area nel tessuto urbano e allo stesso tempo migliorare il benessere dei dipendenti e dei clienti. E come farlo se non con l’arte?

# Facciate di prefabbricati e serbatoi d’acqua come delle vere tele

Etnik Font Hitnes Made Macs Sea Creative Joys e Vesod: sono gli otto street artist protagonisti del progetto che sono stati invitati a trasformare il parco in una vera e propria galleria d’arte a cielo aperto.

Questi artisti di fama mondiale hanno utilizzato facciate di prefabbricati e serbatoi d’acqua come delle vere tele. Murales di ogni forma e colore ricoprono più di 40mila metri quadrati del parco. Si tratta di opere site specific che dialogano proficuamente con l’ambiente circostante seppur in maniera sorprendentemente diversa.

«Abbiamo realizzato un itinerario che mette al centro l’individuo e la natura. Un itinerario composto da otto stili differenti che vogliono creare un ritmo e una cadenza nelle forme e nei concetti lasciando a chi lo visita un senso di nuova identità e di spirito rinnovato frutto di un perdersi e ritrovarsi nei colori e nelle forme nuove» ha commentato Enrico HEMO Sironi l’art director a cui è stato affidato l’intero progetto e non solo.

# La nuova idea di parco logico come un piccolo centro urbano

Il parco si inserisce in un disegno più ampio e Sironi rappresenta il volano di PARKlife il nuovo piano di sviluppo di parchi logistici di Prologis in Italia e nel mondo.

Questi progetti seguono una nuova filosofia che cambia il paradigma nello sviluppo dei parchi logistici e mira a mettere al centro non solo le esigenze dei propri clienti ma anche quelle dei propri dipendenti. L’obiettivo è quindi quello di pensare al parco logistico come un luogo di socializzazione un piccolo centro urbano dove è possibile trovare una serie di servizi che vanno ad arricchire la giornata lavorativa: dal trasporto pubblico alle aree comuni dalle attività̀ nel tempo libero a occasioni di incontro.

Per di più molte delle strutture sono state inoltre realizzate riciclando vecchi container per ridurre l’impatto ambientale dell’operazione. L’idea stessa di sostenibilità̀ si allarga e diventa fruibilità̀ e vivibilità̀ degli spazi grazie anche all’introduzione delle opere degli artisti che ora si possono anche visitare come alll’interno di un museo.

# Da fine maggio il via alle visite gratuite

Il progetto al Prologis Park Lodi apre le “porte” della sua galleria a chiunque voglia vivere un’esperienza alternativa.

Dal 28 maggio 2022 al 18 giugno 2022 ogni sabato alle 11:00 si potrà prenotare una visita gratuita del parco che sorge a sud del capoluogo meneghino lungo l’autostrada A1 Milano – Bologna all’altezza del casello di Casalpusterlengo.

E per chi si è incuriosito e desidera farsi un’idea sul parco nell’attesa della visita ecco una piccola guida sugli artisti e le loro opere inedite.

# Cosa aspettarsi da questa galleria alternativa

Tutte le opere rappresentano l’identità e i valori che Prologis vuole trasmettere agli osservatori e la prima opera che si incontra entrando nel parco è quella di LUCA FONT. Intitolata Evoluzione desidera intraprendere un processo di trasformazione graduale e continuo che coinvolga il visitatore accompagnandolo dalle origini al futuro.

Ci si sposta poi sul tema della natura che interessa l’indagine artistica di HITNES dove ritroviamo le rotte migratorie degli uccelli scorci e suggestioni di luoghi. Cuori e picchia catturano l’occhio dell’osservatore nell’opera di MADE ispirata a valori come coraggio e cambiamento attraverso l’innovazione. Lo spazio di JOYS spicca invece per sequenza di linee parallele e incrociate che si muovono con regole ben precise rappresentando armonia ed equilibrio.

MACS utilizza fantasiosamente un serbatoio dell’acqua strizzando l’occhio alle opere di Andy Warhol mentre SEA CREATIVE sfruttando il secondo serbatoio gioca sapientemente con le stratificazioni tipiche delle cornici ospitanti i manifesti pubblicitari. VESOD invece proietta in una dimensione onirica il visitatore astraendolo in un vortice dove si intrecciano figure e luoghi. Il percorso si chiude con ETNIK e la sua opera dove i volumi architettonici che rappresentano la città in cui l’uomo si muove sono quasi sovrastati dal verde dei giardini verticali in un lavoro realmente tridimensionale.

That is according to the 2021 annual report of the Central Bank which reveals that a record amount in monetary fines imposed on financial firms and individuals by the Central Bank in 2021 contributed to profits at the bank last year increasing by 59 per cent to €1.32 billion.

The report further reveals that a dividend of €1.067 billion is payable to the Exchequer arising from the sharp rise in profits.

In the report which has been laid before the Oireachtas it partly credits the increase in profit with an increase in “other net income” from €201 million to €264 million due to increases in financial regulation monetary penalties and financial regulation industry funding levy income.

The Central Bank’s monetary penalty income increased almost three-fold from €24.68 million to €67 million - the report states that the €67 million “is the highest amount imposed in a single year to date”.

Income from the financial regulation industry funding levy rose from €170 million to €185 million.

Another major contributor to the profits was the Central Bank’s net realised gains from financial operations doubling from €652.2 million in 2020 to €1.27 billion in 2021.

The Central Bank’s overall net income increased by 43.45 per cent from €1.16 billion to €1.67 billion while its expenses increased only marginally from €339.8 million to €356.1 million.

The report shows that pay to Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf rose from €288220 to €293257. The report states that Mr Makhlouf also receives a UK public service pension.

The salary for the deputy governor of prudential regulation Ed Sibley for 2021 was €255006 compared to €250630 for 2020. Earlier this year the Central Bank announced the departure of Mr Sibley when his term ends in August.

The salary for the Central Bank’s other deputy governor Sharon Donnery was at the same level at €255006 for 2021.

The senior officials were three of 12 Central Bank employees to be paid more than €190000 last year.

Another 40 staff received pay between €150000 and €190000 with another 250 earning between €100000 and €150000 last year.

In total 302 members of staff earned over €100000 at the Central Bank last year.

Decline in numbers working for the Central Bank

This compares to 266 in that earning bracket in 2020. The report discloses that pay to key management personnel in 2021 was €11.49 million compared to €10.85 million in 2020.

Numbers employed by the Central Bank last year declined 2115 to 2110 with staff costs increasing from €233 million to €258 million.

The report shows that the Central Bank had 977 employed in financial regulation in 2021.

The amount paid out by the Central Bank in 2021 under ‘consultancy’ increased by just under €1 million to €7.4 million with legal advice accounting for €1.33 million. The largest component of consultants’ pay was IT coming in at €2.32 million.

Legal fees concerning 17 separate cases initiated or taken against the Central Bank in 2021 totalled €1.7 million.

The pay under staff hospitality last year more than doubled from €46000 in 2020 to €97000 last year.

At the end of 2021 the amount of Central Bank gold reserves stood at €492.8 million - a 65 per cent increase on the €299 million in gold at the end of 2020.

A note attached to the accounts states that “the increase in the balance at year-end 2021 is due to purchases of gold as part of the Central Bank’s long term investment strategy and the change in the market value of gold holdings from the year-end 2020 to 2021”.",,,,,,

The office of Mayor Shirley Washington recently gave an update on several initiatives and projects happening in Pine Bluff specifically concerning the former Bank of America building Opportunity House Enterprise Fleet Management and Pine Bluff Aquatics as well as a field trip city officials took to Texarkana.

""The Executive Office had conversations with a company interested in purchasing the former Bank of America building. Unfortunately after further review the company owner recently advised our office that they are no longer interested in submitting an offer for the property"" officials said in the memo.

Washington added that because there were not any viable candidates for lease or purchase of the building the city needed to proceed with repairs to the air circulation system in the building.

""John Smith maintenance director completed the RFP process to secure proposals to replace the air handlers with only one company Mechanical Service Company d/b/a Powers responding"" officials said. ""It is essential to have air circulating in the building as the summer months approach to prevent mold and mildew growth hence the direction of moving forward with the bid proposal.""

A resolution providing Washington authorization to execute an agreement with Mechanical Service Co. to perform replacement of the air handlers at a cost of $54909 has been drafted and will be presented to the city council for review and approval.

The mayor's office has extended the request for quotes to identify homeless shelter operators for the Opportunity House on June 1 to allow additional time for qualified organizations to submit their proposals.

According to the memo Washington has connected with DePaul USA a national homeless services nonprofit organization with several managed locations across the country including Jericho Way in Little Rock which is interested in replying to the RFP with a proposal.

""Representatives from Jericho Way also visited Pine Bluff on May 18 to tour the Opportunity House as part of their evaluation process"" the memo read. ""A few internal committee members are also planning to visit Jericho Way and St. Francis on Friday May 27 2022 for a 'window' into how DePaul USA is managing these facilities.""

According to the memo the final architectural design plans were presented May 23 by Ron Woods of Woods Group Architects Inc. to the internal committee. Larry Matthews director of economic and community development will present plans for review at the next Public Works Committee meeting according to Washington.

On May 23 Washington signed a lease agreement solidifying the contract between the city of Pine Bluff and Enterprise Fleet Management. Enterprise Fleet Management will now place orders for the first round of vehicles (Chevy Traverses and Silverados) by the end of the month and then place a second order for vehicles in July. The vehicles will be used by the police department.

The memo also mentioned that the Carl A. Redus Jr. Aquatics Center will begin a six-week ""Learn to Swim"" summer program from June 6 through July 28 for children unable to swim between the ages of 3 to 17. Registration for this program started May 19 with spots filling rapidly. This is the second year the free swim program has been made available to community youths.

A small contingency of representatives from the mayor's office Urban Renewal and the department of Economic & Community Development also traveled to Texarkana to meet with city officials from the twin city recently.

According to the memo the mayor's office initiated the fact-finding trip based on a presentation Texarkana's community development team gave at the 47th Neighborhoods USA Conference.

Officials said the primary purpose of the trip was to acquire more information concerning this region's revitalization efforts in crucial areas of the city such as downtown and the South Boston Corridor.

""Individually these cities have a population of less than 40000 but through their combined efforts outreach to private developers community support and leveraging of various financing resources they have been able to affect major economic development for the region"" officials said.

The main highlights of the trip included a tour of Hotel Grim a historic hotel that has been vacant for 30-plus years and is in dilapidated condition similar to Pine Bluff's Hotel Pines. The hotel is in the process of being fully restored to include 93 affordable apartments a grand lobby gym business center coffee shop and public meeting area.

The City of Texarkana partnered with private developers to bring this vision to fruition with a total project price tag of $26 million $2.4 million of which came from the city.

The restoration of hotels to affordable housing has been a major economic development boost for the cities as it has attracted investors and businesses to the downtown area officials said.

The group also toured the 1894 City Market a mixed-use development that was converted from an old train station. The area features market-rate loft apartments an art gallery and commercial space on the ground floor all developed by a private investor.

The Go Forward Pine Bluff Team will be hosting a community town hall meeting at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday June 23 at the Pine Bluff Convention Center. According to the mayor's memo the purpose of the town hall is to provide citizens an update regarding Go Forward's programs and allow citizens to ask questions and receive answers from the leadership of Go Forward.

The bankers from Goldman Sachs and LionTree came with many deal ideas according to four people with knowledge of the meeting. The most logical one the bankers said was combining some parts of Paramount — which owns networks like Nickelodeon and MTV and the Paramount+ streaming service — with those owned by Comcast the cable giant that owns NBCUniversal and the Peacock streaming service. The two companies already have a streaming joint venture in Europe.

But in the end the board Ms. Redstone and Bob Bakish the company’s chief executive did not feel compelled to pursue any of the combinations. They would continue to zig while Hollywood zagged.

That is Paramount — with its collection of streaming services including Pluto TV and Showtime in addition to Paramount+ — would keep going it alone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbmVicmFza2FwdWJsaWNtZWRpYS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGVzL291dC1vZi1zdGF0ZS1jb21wYW55LWJ1eWluZy11cC1vbWFoYS1ob21lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Out Of State Company Buying Up Omaha Homes,"North Omaha impacted

Angel Starks and her real estate agent colleagues began to notice a sharp increase in out-of-state buyers. They took note of their new tactics.

These buyers pay in cash. They waive standard inspections. They make offers over the list price.

That’s the aggressive approach that Vinebrook takes as well – an approach outlined by one of Vinebrook’s local contractors longtime Omaha-area real estate broker Bruce Powell in an email sent to real estate agents early this year.

The email was forwarded to the Flatwater Free Press by an industry insider not Starks.

In the email Powell said Vinebrook had bought “over 16 million dollars’ worth of property” in the Omaha metro in the past year. “We want to keep that going this year” he wrote.

“We can buy them 1 at a time or if you have an investor that has 5000 we can do that also… Our offers are cash quick closings. Once we do our walk through there (is) no formal inspection termite inspections or appraisal.”

Vinebrook has amassed $55 million in cash according to its most recent filing. It uses that money as a hammer making cash offers that most Omahans – people who must take out a loan to afford a house – can’t beat.

“That puts first-time home buyers at a disadvantage” said Amanda Brewer CEO of Habitat for Humanity of Omaha. “They can’t compete with out-of-state investors who have cash offers.”

A cash sale over the list price often increases the home values on the block and neighborhood said Starks a real estate agent who sells homes all over the metro including in North Omaha.

That’s good if you are selling a home. It’s not necessarily good if you are a North Omaha homeowner. Property valuations in the area are now the most undervalued in the county. Valuations – and the resulting tax bill – will likely soon increase.

And it’s very bad if you are an Omaha resident hoping to buy an affordable home in the northeast part of the city.

“It’s pricing everyone out” Starks said. “If there’s nothing for anyone to buy…we’re giving them a mindset that they are meant to be renters forever.”

“That should be a choice not a corner they’re painted into.”

Black Omahans are especially impacted said Pierce Greenberg a Creighton professor who has studied eviction and homeownership issues.

Most Americans’ biggest financial asset is the home they own Greenberg said. It’s the big-ticket item they sell or pass to the next generation. The racial wealth gap is exacerbated by the fact that fewer Black adults own their own homes.

“We can’t untether this conversation from talking about race” Greenberg said. “For this to be happening in neighborhoods with a history of racial segregation…where all of this is playing out is an issue that can’t be ignored.”

“That’s a problem”

Even Omahans who have benefited from Vinebrook’s emergence aren’t always sure the company’s presence is good for the city.

Nate Bjorklund had owned and rented out a small two-bedroom house on N. 33rd Street for more than a decade.

Then encouraged by a local property manager he put it on the market for “a crazy number.”

Vinebrook counter-offered “with not quite as crazy of a number” he says. Just like that the deal was done: $72000 in cash more than triple what Bjorklund paid for the house in 2008.

The local landlord was thrilled. At least until he saw what Vinebrook was doing with the home.

The tenant living in the home when it was sold was “fantastic” Bjorklund said but Vinebrook had no interest in keeping her there. Instead they wanted her to leave so they could put in new carpet new paint – and a new higher monthly rate.

Bjorklund had rented the home for $695 a month a number he felt was fair and could always attract a tenant. Now he said Vinebrook has it on the market for $995 a month. The home has sat vacant for months its old owner said.

“My wife and I are very small time and we understand that if you can take care of people karma has a way of coming back to you” he said.

“Unfortunately I don’t think this group really gets that” he said of Vinebrook.

Shauna and Andre Mackins are also frustrated with Vinebrook.

The renters live in a Vinebrook-owned home on Maple Street. They experience nuisances that will sound familiar to many renters no matter who their landlord is: The screen door is busted they said. Cold air pours in through the sliding doors in the winter.

But the Mackins said they have also faced real issues with Vinebrook’s operation. When Shauna Mackins tried to pay February rent – on the last day before an eviction notice would be sent – she said she got caught in a customer service nightmare. One Vinebrook representative took down her info promised to call her back and didn’t. She called back and the same thing happened. She tried to contact the district manager to no avail.

The clock ticked toward late afternoon.The banks closed for the day. An eviction notice was automatically triggered by the company.

The Mackins racked up hundreds of dollars in late fees to avoid eviction. Much could have been avoided Shauna Mackins said had she simply been able to speak to the correct Vinebrook representative.

“Buyers beware” she said. “I wish we had time to do our research (on Vinebrook) before we moved in here.”

In an email Vinebrook co-founder Sprong said that Vinebrook takes resident concerns seriously. They monitor these requests and the company’s response time he said and are working to “enhance our customer service offering” he wrote.

Vinebrook is far from the only national real investment company plunging into local housing markets.

For example: Invitation Homes is a company built by Blackstone the world’s largest private equity firm which started buying up houses in the wake of the 2008 mortgage and foreclosure crisis.

Today Invitation Homes which has spun off from Blackstone is a massive publicly-traded company. It owns and rents out roughly 80000 homes – making it the single largest landlord of single-family homes in the country.

Invitation owns more than 13000 houses just in the Atlanta metro area.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbG9pdHRlLmNvbS9uei9lbi9zZXJ2aWNlcy90YXgvcGVyc3BlY3RpdmVzLzIwMjItbWlsZWFnZS1yYXRlcy1wdWJsaXNoZWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 mileage reimbursement rates published | Tax Alerts – June 2022,"Self-employed and close companies

If you are a sole trader or qualifying close company and use the kilometre rate method to claim business vehicle costs this new rate applies for the 2022 year being the year 1 April 2021 - 31 March 2022 if you have a standard balance date. The increase in the rate will increase the amount of vehicle costs you can claim when you file your 2022 tax return. If you have already filed your 2022 income tax return and relied on the 2021 kilometre rates depending on the amount of the difference between the two amounts you may be able to self-correct the difference in your 2023 income return or if the difference is material file a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (which is only available within four months after the filing of an income tax return).

Employers

If you are an employer and are reimbursing employees for work-related travel the increased rates apply to reimbursements made from the date that they were issued – 27 May 2022. If your reimbursement policy states that you will reimburse employees at the Inland Revenue rate you will need to update the rate you pay as soon as practically possible. When rates are increased a lag in updating rates paid to employees while potentially disadvantageous to employees does not cause a PAYE problem.

If your reimbursement policy states a set rate at which you will reimburse work related mileage and this is lower than the new rate you do not need to do anything as the amount you pay will be tax free but you may get pressure from employees to increase the reimbursement rate.

As noted above it is not compulsory to use the Inland Revenue rates any reasonable amount can be reimbursed but documentation will need to exist to support any payments in excess of the Inland Revenue rates if you treat these as not taxable.

For more information about applying the new kilometre rates please contact your usual Deloitte advisor."

Ambassador car modified new model 2022: Although things are being modified with the help of modern technologies these days some things always remain iconic. Likewise only a few people know the name of the 'Ambassador' car as they identify these cars as 'Sarkari Gaadi'. Who is doing it? Hindustan Motor Financial Corporation of India (HMFCI).

Hindustan Motor Financial Corporation of India (HMFCI) is an associate company of the CK Birla Group. In exciting news for the year 2022 the company confirmed that the Ambassador might make a comeback soon with a new model not just the way 'Sarkari Gaadi' used to work as it may be modified a bit.

The iconic car is most likely to be seen on the roads again. It may be recalled that the Hindustan Motors' Ambassador has been a legend in the field of automobiles.

Be it a government officer or a family man people were fond of the Ambassador. The car served as most of the Indian families’ first car or 'Sarkari Gaadi'.

It may be recalled that Ambassador was introduced in 1957 and was based on the imported 1956 Morris Oxford III series. In over 57 years of its stint the Sedan remain unchanged and got just a few features added. These included minor facelifts and engine upgrades.

When he heard Ukrainian refugees would be coming to Nova Scotia he and his wife Sheila started collecting donated furniture.

In the weeks to follow their work grew into something much bigger.

""We put the word out and we've been flooded with kindness and we've been flooded with donations — more than we can store more than we can pick up more than we can handle"" said Langille who lives in East Hants.

Langille now has five storage units in Halifax that are paid for by donations. The Lions Club has been a major contributor.

Langille said the items that are most requested are beds and children's car seats. (Jeorge Sadi/CBC)

The units are filled with everything from furniture to clothing to children's toys. Langille accepts anything household related as long it is in good condition.

""Everything that we have has been from local donors"" he said. ""Throughout the province we've had donors as far away as the [Annapolis] Valley and Truro.""

The Langilles couldn't handle it on their own so volunteers stepped up to help them run the distribution and move the furniture from place to place.

""It's just humans helping humans"" Langille said.

Langille said his faith pushed him to start the initiative. (Jeorge Sadi/CBC)

Ukrainian families or their hosts can book a time to pick up all the items they need. The group holds a pickup day every week and multiple families pull up to load their vehicles.

Anna Zherdetska is one of the volunteers. Since fleeing her home in Kyiv and coming to Nova Scotia she wants to help others who are in a similar situation.

""I'm very grateful that Canadians are very kind and they help us a lot ... Rick and his wife Sheila met us at the airport they helped us to find a place"" Zherdetska said. ""I want to help because when I receive good I need to give back this good.""

Zherdetska said it's a sad situation for any refugee who has to ""start their life from zero"" but the work Langille and the other volunteers are doing can help the transition.

Anna Zherdetska joined the effort to help fellow Ukrainians settle in Nova Scotia. (Jeorge Sadi/CBC)

Langille said aside from Ukrainians many of the volunteers are from local churches. But he has also worked with people from the Russian community.

Anna Vetrova moved to Canada two years ago from St. Petersburg Russia. She acts as a translator to help Ukrainians navigate the process of collecting their new belongings.

""I think it's important for the community to feel united in the good cause"" Vetrova said. ""Maybe to overcome the differences we have and to focus on ... what a difference we can make just helping people.""

Anna Vetrova said she wanted to help as a way to show she is against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Jeorge Sadi/CBC)

But one problem is threatening the work the group does.

Langille said the group has been told they can no longer hold their weekly gatherings for families coming to pick up some goods. He said the storage unit company Metro Self Storage told him it was an insurance issue.

So the group is looking for a new home base.

""Either a warehouse or a vacant store a vacant office building school church"" Langille said. ""Anything that allows us to essentially drive up and unload and load without having to negotiate stairs.""

Storage company looking for a solution

In a statement to CBC News Bruce Shannon the vice-president of Metro Self Storage said the company is ""fully supportive of the cause"" and provided Langille ""units with charitable discounts.""

Shannon said ""the challenge we face is that our facilities are not set up for tenants to run events out of their units"" but the company is trying to ""work out a solution for all parties involved.""

Langille said anyone who wants to offer a new storage location can get in touch via the Facebook group Atlantic Canada Hosts for Ukrainians which now has more than 8000 members from Canada and Ukraine.

He said his group has already helped more than 30 families but they are gearing up to help even more since a charter flight of more than 300 Ukrainians is arriving in Halifax next week.

""Right now we've been distributing but our big focus right now is stockpiling because we know that the need is going to become much greater"" Langille said.

The Galaxy phone turned out to be a very successful package overall but it still had a few teething troubles.

In particular Samsung's policy surrounding the processor raised some questions. The Exynos SoC intended for the European market was eagerly awaited not least because of the cooperation with AMD. Unfortunately this did not fully live up to our expectations in our aforementioned review which is reason enough for us to take a look at the version of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen.1 that is available outside Europe in retailers such as our rental partner Trading Shenzhen among others.



Those looking for detailed information apart from the SoC such as the individual sections of case software or communication should take a look at our detailed review of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display is also more or less identical. We measured a minimally low brightness on the Snapdragon version which could be explained by a slight quality fluctuation in production.

The company has been powering automobile sector as well both four and two wheelers with its technologies and solutions. From Mahindra’s XUV700 to Ola’s electric scooter the US-based company has been lending its support for the new age innovations like autonomous driving and telematics. Rajen Vagadia VP and President at Qualcomm India shared some of the company’s offering transforming the automotive industry as India readies itself to roll out 5G services soon.

Can you help us understand the role Qualcomm is playing in creating connected and intelligent automotive experiences?

With over 20 years of experience Qualcomm serves as the technology provider for the global automotive industry working alongside global automakers and their Tier 1 partners who are increasingly using a broad portfolio of our automotive solutions. In the past the automotive industry relied on low-cost highly optimized manufacturing supported by robust R&D and skilled labor. Today a growing customer demand for unique features and use cases for next-gen automobiles and transportation solutions is steadily increasing creating tremendous opportunity for modernization that which is led by:

• Electrification and battery electric vehicles that in turn require the deployment of charging infrastructure and innovation in battery technology

• Advanced semiconductors and software that allow automakers to redesign the electronics and digital architecture to create a continuously evolving platform on wheels where a software-defined vehicle takes the lead

• Always-connected vehicle platforms that enable a plethora of use cases unlocking new business models that accommodate passenger vehicles commercial fleets shared mobility and all forms of fractional ownership

• Automated driving that makes cars safer; a highly-assisted experience that allows drivers to disengage and potentially be removed altogether — enabling a variety of new use cases in passenger and commercial applications

At Qualcomm Technologies we are continuously innovating on our transportation solutions portfolio developing an ever-evolving roadmap of products technology innovations and partnerships to help redefine the new automotive and transportation economy. Our innovations are bringing the consumer wireless technologies semiconductor cloud and software platforms together with 5G AI XR and high-performance compute along with advanced audio video camera displays and sensor technology — all designed to deliver premium in-vehicle and on-road consumer experiences.

There have been conversations about the Snapdragon Digital Chassis. Can you help us understand the architecture?

The Snapdragon Digital Chassis is a comprehensive set of cloud-connected automotive platforms for – telematics and connectivity computing driver assistance and autonomy. Automakers use these to create customization which is built on four pillars – Digital Cockpit; Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD); Auto Connectivity Platforms; and Car-to-Cloud Services. Let us talk a bit more about these four offerings.

The Snapdragon Digital Cockpit Platform provides automakers with the opportunity to transform in-car experiences and offers an always-connected System-on-Chip (SoC) and virtualized software solutions. The Digital Cockpit creates a multi-display multi-camera premium audio video and multimedia experience that supports both safety as well as the overall consumer experience.

The ADAS solution offers a full set of advanced features for drive assistance and autonomy. It offers a flexible architecture that allows automakers and Tier 1 (key design and manufacturing partners) to bring their own drive policy parking or driver monitoring stack and advanced navigation that can be integrated with our turnkey Arriver based driver assistance stack.

The Auto Connectivity Platform allows automakers to meet the increasing demands of safer and more immersive driving experiences. It is powered by LTE 5G connected services cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) Wi-Fi Bluetooth and precise positioning – which together securely connect vehicles to-the cloud to each other and to the surrounding environment and infrastructure.

Our Car-to-Cloud Services enable automakers to offer flexibility of features performance upgrades and new functionalities through pre-integrated software and services platforms that are designed for new monetization models which automakers can develop.

Which are the Indian auto OEMs that Qualcomm is currently working with? What are the kinds of technologies that Qualcomm is providing these OEMs?

In India we work with almost all the big auto OEMs both in the 4-wheeler and the 2-wheeler segment.

To name a few publicly announced engagements we partnered with Mahindra on the very successful XUV700 for their 'SmartCore' cockpit domain controller technology which is powered by the 3rd-generation Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms developed in collaboration with Visteon to transform in-vehicle experiences for the India market.

We also provide the technology powering the Ola Electric scooters. The platform used provides connectivity computing capabilities and enables rich immersive displays with power saving software.

Ather Energy also uses our Snapdragon platform in their smart electric scooters.

How will 5G and other advanced technologies help transform the auto industry?

The automotive sector has seen high tech adoption over the last year that has surpassed the cumulative rate of the past five years. Automobiles now offer an increasingly future-ready experience that will enable the passenger to drive comfortably be safe and better entertained. These include 4G and 5G connectivity that enable high bandwidth channels for high resolution touch screen displays high resolution media streaming and high-definition video. Broad automotive industry trends of electrification mobility-as-a-service and autonomous driving are already taking advantage of new 5G connectivity solutions. C-V2X supported by 5G through advanced alerts and ADAS will exponentially enhance driver safety. The 5G roll out and EV adoption in India will lead to deeper partnerships between the auto ecosystem where partners will leverage each other’s capabilities to drive faster innovation. Start-ups are using 5G in their designs to offer services and solutions taking advantage of lower latency faster and better bandwidth and higher security offered by 5G.

From an India standpoint with 5G still around the corner do you think there will be a delay in the auto sector undergoing a transformation?

The transformation is already underway as evidenced in the latest vehicles launched by auto makers and the depth of technology-driven user experiences that are being integrated into the dashboard and other parts of the automobile. 5G telematics and ADAS will redefine in-vehicle experiences for passengers and enable a host of safety and traffic-related use cases. 5G will also support C-V2X technologies that allow vehicles to communicate directly with each other-vehicle to vehicle(V2V) roadside infrastructure-vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) vehicle to internet (V2I) and vehicle to pedestrians (V2P). This will encourage safe behavior among drivers and everyone on the road. While V2X features were earlier found only in high-end luxury vehicles they are now commonly seen across all car segments. It is expected tha by the year 2024 5G use cases such as fleet telematics devices and in-vehicle toll devices will leverage the already available V2X features in cars expediting the transition to intelligent transportation.

What is your take on the current scenario of the automotive industry in India? What are your thoughts on the PLI for the sector?

The Indian automobile industry has been in transition with the evolution of the EV ecosystem and disruption created due to the pandemic. However the sector has also seen good investments new OEMs & factories which will eventually lead to increases in employment opportunities. The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme by the government announced last year is proving to be a big catalyst as it will help global companies move parts of their supply chain to India. With the advent of 5G and smart technologies accelerating the scale of connectivity and processing at the edge the demand for more innovation will only continue to grow creating greater opportunities within sectors like automotive healthcare and manufacturing. This will also enable local companies to serve not just India but also export their products. Major announcements from the Union Budget like a new battery swapping policy and implementation of electric vehicles in the commercial vehicle segment will certainly help the sector in the long run. The growth of the battery swapping infrastructure will help encourage a higher adoption of EV vehicles especially in the 2 and 3-wheeler commercial vehicle segment. This has increased focus on expanding EV infrastructure across the country with more EV charging stations to help vehicle owners shift to electric cars without any after-sales concerns. This will also encourage the sector to create sustainable and innovative business models for battery and energy-as-a-service thereby improving the efficiency of the EV ecosystem in the country.

Is Qualcomm working with any startups that cater to the auto space? What is the kind of involvement that you have?

Start-ups play a crucial role in the automotive ecosystem which Qualcomm constantly supports. Over last several years Qualcomm has worked with some start-ups to move from the drawing board to launching a commercial product through various programs such as Qualcomm Design in India Challenge. The Indian EV space is creating new opportunities for EV startups to enter and disrupt the industry. We also intend to continue to play the role of a catalyst by being early investors in prospective startups in the automotive segment through our venture arm Qualcomm Ventures.

The company does not intend to leave it in the near future and even plans; to increase the number of models in this segment. It is assumed that we will see four tablets three of which will be part of the Xiaomi Pad 6 series and one will be released under the Redmi brand.

One of the sources spoke in favor of the fact that the new items will receive chips from MediaTek but it is likely that Qualcomm processors will also find a place in the new tablets of the Xiaomi Pad 6 line. There was a message that there is a possibility that devices will be available in two versions of the hardware platform. Xiaomi Pad 6 will receive Qualcomm and MediaTek chips. For example Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Dimensity 9000.

Among the possible improvements in the Pad 6 is an increase in charging power to 120 W versus 67 W for its predecessors as well as the installation of a display with a refresh rate of 144 Hz. Almost certainly all new items will receive a new version of MIUI for Pad and improved speakers. Due to the powerful hardware and energy-intensive screen it is important that a capacious battery be available here. August is the possible debut time for the Xiaomi Pad 6.

Xiaomi Pad 6 tablet series

After a pause of several years in August last year Xiaomi released a new generation of the tablet the fifth in a row. At the same time the company did not limit itself to the release of one model; but released two versions at once. Now it is preparing an update for Xiaomi Pad 5; and plans to introduce it a year after the release of its predecessor.

A message came that Xiaomi Pad 6 is ready and the device was sent to receive the necessary certificates. In particular a mention of a device with the index 22081283G was found in the unified register of notifications about the characteristics of encryption tools and goods; and there is reason to believe that we are talking about Xiaomi Pad 6. August is called the release time of the tablet.

We assume that this year Xiaomi will release four tablets; where three will be available under the brand of Xiaomi itself and one – Redmi. Xiaomi Pad 6 Pad 6 Pro Pad 6 Pro 5G (highly doubtful) and Redmi Pad can launch. The Xiaomiui publication suggests that the Xiaomi Pad 6 series will receive chipsets from MediaTek not Qualcomm. But this is only an assumption that has no support by anything; and there is no reason to believe that in the case of tablets they will refuse to install Snapdragon chips.

Tan placed a call earlier this month to VMware Inc VMW.N Chairman Michael Dell also the chief executive of computer maker Dell Technologies Inc DELL.N.

He proposed one of the biggest tie-ups in the history of the technology sector. Broadcom Inc AVGO.O the chip maker that Tan leads was willing to acquire VMware a cloud software company for $61 billion.

For Tan now 70 the deal would be the culmination of a string of acquisitions that has helped him turn Broadcom into a technology conglomerate worth $225 billion along the way building a reputation as an astute dealmaker and ruthless cost-cutter.

Dell who personally owns 40% of VMware and controls it together with buyout firm Silver Lake had a decision to make. Hold out for a better deal or risk losing out as technology stocks plunged amid concerns about a looming economic slowdown and rampant inflation.

Broadcom offered $61 billion in cash and stock for VMware a 50% premium to where the shares of the latter were trading. To clinch the deal Tan also agreed to give VMware 40 days from the signing of the deal to search for another suitor who may offer a better price. VMware said yes. Read full story

This account of the negotiations is based on people involved in the deal who requested anonymity.

Broadcom had been eyeing VMware for months but held off from making an approach because it was concerned that Dell and Silver Lake would not engage due to the timing of VMware's spin-off from Dell Technologies in November 2021. Shareholders risk losing the tax-free status of their spin-off if their company engages in sale talks in the first six months after the separation.

Tan's cost-cutting reputation prompted VMware's chief executive Raghu Raghuram to write to his employees on the deal's announcement to assure them that the ""perception"" of Broadcom putting profits ahead of innovation was ""inaccurate"". He wrote that Tan ""is committed to cultivating a shared culture of innovation.""

That reputation stems from Tan's strategy of acquiring businesses he calls ""franchises"" and then slashing what he sees as excessive sales and marketing expenses and unnecessary investments. He is also quick to jettison parts of those businesses that underperform.

""He runs Broadcom like an investment portfolio... they are all independent fiefdoms"" said a former employee at the company who worked closely with Tan. ""If he has a dominant position in any market he'll go in and raise those prices.""

Tan and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

Tan has said he was an ""18-year-old skinny kid"" growing up in Malaysia when he won a scholarship in 1971 to attend engineering school at MIT. His parents could not afford to send him to college. He went on to earn an MBA from Harvard University.

He held several executive positions in Malaysia and the United States before joining chip maker Integrated Circuit Systems in 1994 rising to become chief executive in 1999.

It was Silver Lake that helped recruit Tan as chief executive of the company that would go on to become Broadcom. In 2006 Tan joined Avago Technologies a semiconductor company that Silver Lake and KKR Co Inc KKR.N another buyout firm had acquired the year before for $2.66 billion.

A spate of deals followed as Tan embarked on consolidating the semiconductor industry often with backing from Silver Lake. In 2014 Avago paid $6.6 billion for storage chipmaker LSI Corp. In 2015 it acquired Broadcom for $37 billion and took its name. In 2016 Broadcom acquired network gear maker Brocade Communications Systems Inc for $5.9 billion.

QUALCOMM BID THWARTED

In 2017 Broadcom launched a hostile $117 billion takeover bid for rival chipmaker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O that would have been the largest technology deal of all time. It was thwarted by the U.S. government over concerns that Broadcom which was at the time headquartered in Singapore would become too dominant in the U.S. semiconductor industry at the expense of innovation.

Tan then turned his attention to software companies which like semiconductors can generate reliable cash flow. Broadcom took over business software firm CA Technologies Inc for $18.9 billion and acquired Symantec Corp's security division for $10.7 billion.

Following every acquisition Broadcom paid down much of the debt it had taken on to help fund it using the cash flow of its businesses. This has emboldened Tan to carry on with his spree of acquisitions said Matt Britzman analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

""Broadcom has de-levered quickly after each large acquisition"" Britzman said.- Reuters"

Meta Quest (2): Air Link and Virtual Desktop PC VR Streaming Guide

Der Artikel kann nur mit aktiviertem JavaScript dargestellt werden. Bitte aktiviere JavaScript in deinem Browser und lade die Seite neu.

With Air Link and Virtual Desktop you can stream PC VR games wirelessly to your Meta Quest 2. I explain how to do that in the following guide.

With the launch of the Meta Quest in May 2019 a long-held wish of VR fans comes true: For the first time you could experience a full-fledged virtual reality without a PC cables and external sensors.

However the decoupling from the PC also has disadvantages. Since the Meta Quest and its successor run on a mobile chip the VR headsets have tight performance limits. As a result VR games usually do not look as good as on the PC.

PC VR streaming remedies this by combining the best of both worlds: the graphical power of the PC with the wireless freedom of Meta Quest.

What solutions are available?

The paid VR app Virtual Desktop offers high-quality PC VR streaming since 2019. Wireless data transfer to VR headsets existed before with other apps but developer Guy Godin has optimized PC VR streaming and made it more accessible allowing his solution to reach new user bases. Today Virtual Desktop is one of the most popular VR apps on the Quest platform.

Due to the huge success of Virtual Desktop Meta released its own free solution called Air Link in April 2021. Air Link is an evolution of the 2019 Oculus Link wired PC VR streaming solution.

What's the difference between Air Link and Virtual Desktop?

Air Link and Virtual Desktop work on the same principle. Similarities differences advantages and disadvantages are listed below:

Air Link is free  while Virtual Desktop costs about $20.

 while Virtual Desktop costs about $20. Virtual Desktop offers significantly more settings  so you have more control over PC VR streaming.

 so you have more control over PC VR streaming. Air Link is compatible with all PC VR apps which is not the case with Virtual Desktop (see compatibility list).

In terms of streaming features ease of use and latency Air Link and Virtual Desktop are about on par when it comes to PC VR streaming. Virtual Desktop offers Synchronous Spacewarp (SSW) technology for smoother streaming while Air Link uses AFI (still in beta) and both offer an optional sharpening filter.

when it comes to PC VR streaming. Virtual Desktop offers Synchronous Spacewarp (SSW) technology for smoother streaming while Air Link uses AFI (still in beta) and both offer an optional sharpening filter. Air Link currently has issues on Windows 11 that Virtual Desktop does not.

Virtual Desktop offers features besides PC VR streaming . The VR app brings your PC desktop into virtual reality and lets you work watch (3D) movies and play 2D games in great-looking virtual environments like a home theater or gaming room (see VR home theater guide).

. The VR app brings your PC desktop into virtual reality and lets you work watch (3D) movies and play 2D games in great-looking virtual environments like a home theater or gaming room (see VR home theater guide). Virtual Desktop also lets you stream immersive video in all imaginable formats from your PC to your VR headsets.

If you are trying PC VR streaming for the first time and are only looking for wireless streaming you should try Air Link first. If you run into problems you can always consider buying Virtual Desktop. If neither of these works you can use Oculus Link to establish a USB cable connection to the PC.

What do I need for PC VR streaming?

For the most latency-free PC VR streaming you need the following:

a Meta Quest or Meta Quest 2 (review)

a Windows 10 PC that meets the minimum requirements for Oculus Link. There are still problems on Windows 11 (as of May 2022) but Meta is working on a solution.

An AC or AX router with Gigabit Ethernet and 5-Ghz band.

For best results the router must be connected to the PC via an Ethernet cable within sight of the VR headset and at least one meter above the ground.

If the router is located in another room it is possible to use a dedicated router for PC VR streaming only. In this case the dedicated router has to be configured as an access point. The following comparatively inexpensive AC router like the TP-Link Archer C6 should be completely sufficient for these purposes.

AX routers like the ASUS RT-AX55 are newer and support Wi-Fi 6 but cost more and are not necessarily better than the older AC routers when it comes to PC VR streaming.

It is worth buying an AX router if many users in a household access the same network at the same time since Wi-Fi 6 regulates the data transfer better. If you want a setup with a dedicated router only for PC VR streaming and want to save money you can safely use an AC router.

How to set up Air Link for PC VR streaming

Download and install the Oculus PC app if you haven't already. Make sure your router is on the 5Ghz band connected to your PC via Ethernet cable and within sight of your VR headsets and at least three feet off the ground. If you use a dedicated router it must be set up as an access point beforehand. Make sure that your PC and the Meta Quest use the same Wi-Fi. If you use a dedicated router the Quest must be connected to its WLAN. In your Meta Quest go to Settings > Experimental and enable Air Link. Then click on ""Next"". In the Quick Settings select the Oculus Air Link menu item. Now your computer should be displayed. Select it and click ""Pair"" to pair it once with your Meta Quest. You may need to confirm a code in the Oculus PC app and your Meta Quest. Thereafter select ""Launch."" You should now see the Oculus PC app user interface in front of you.

To exit Air Link you need to select the leftmost menu field in the same user interface. Here you can make further settings for Air Link or quit Air Link.

If you prefer to use Oculus Link instead of Air Link deactivate the option under Settings > Experimental.

Tips & tricks for optimal PC VR streaming

General

Besides image quality latency is crucial for good PC VR streaming: If it is too high there are noticeable delays in virtual reality between an action (head rotation room movement button press) and its representation in VR which can dampen the gaming experience and cause nausea.

The expected latency for wireless streaming is between 25 and 50 milliseconds and depends on factors like network setup graphics card and software settings.

If the router is located in another room transmits in the 2.4 GHz range or does not support Gigabit Ethernet higher latency times can occur.

A 20 or 30 series RTX graphics card may have lower latency because these graphics cards have a faster encoder than older cards or AMD graphics cards.

may have lower latency because these graphics cards have a faster encoder than older cards or AMD graphics cards. In general the better a PC VR game looks the more likely it is that latency will increase or that micro-stutters will occur. This is because the graphics card has to compress the image and audio signal which requires processing power. If it is scarce PC VR streaming may suffer.

In this case try reducing the graphical details in the game or Meta Quest's render resolution and frame rate. You can do the latter in the Oculus PC app by selecting your Quest under ""Devices"" and scrolling down to the corresponding settings in the right bar.

in the game or Meta Quest's render resolution and frame rate. You can do the latter in the Oculus PC app by selecting your Quest under ""Devices"" and scrolling down to the corresponding settings in the right bar. Further settings are available in the Oculus Debug Tool. You can find the program in the following directory: Program Files > Oculus > Support > oculus-diagnostics. You can find out what the settings do in detail on Reddit. The final result also depends on the performance of your PC.

Air Link

You can adjust settings on Air Link by pressing the Oculus button and selecting the menu field on the far left in the user interface that appears.

Here you can choose between a dynamic and fixed Air Link bitrate. For starters it is better to choose the dynamic bitrate.

The bitrate determines the image quality. If you choose the dynamic bitrate the latency is prioritized instead of the image quality and the bitrate is automatically adjusted depending on how good your network connection is. If your connection is poor this setting could negatively affect the image quality to ensure good latency.

If you choose the fixed bitrate the image quality will be prioritized instead of the latency. If your connection is poor this setting could negatively affect latency to ensure good image quality. In principle latency is more important than image quality for a good VR experience. Of course both are important.

Virtual Desktop

Virtual Desktop lets you view your latency in real time. To do so open the Virtual Desktop menu by pressing the system button on the left touch controller and select Streaming > Advanced Options. Here you should be able to enable the Performance Overlay which shows all the essential values in VR apps.

Also experiment with the settings in the Streamer app as well as in the Virtual Desktop under ""Settings"" and ""Streaming"" to achieve optimal PC VR streaming. The final result also depends on the performance of your PC.

The setup is too complicated for me. Are there any alternatives?

If it has to be wireless then there are currently no alternatives. But there is hope: According to rumors Meta is working on a USB dongle for Air Link which could make the router superfluous and thus simplify the setup significantly. For those who can live with a cable the simple Oculus Link is an option.

I have Windows 11 and my Air Link is juddering. What's the problem?

The Oculus PC app does not yet support Windows 11 (as of May 2022) and an issue with the operating system is causing judder with Oculus Link and Air Link.

Meta is working on an update that should fix the problem. In the meantime there is a workaround for the judder on Windows 11. Virtual Desktop does not have judder issues on Windows 11.

Where can I find more information and help?

For more information about Air Link visit the Oculus support page. For Virtual Desktop there is an official FAQ on the website and a Discord server where you can ask questions.

Playtex underwent a leveraged buyout and Brian noted: “That led to us all eventually making important money that changed our lives for sure.”

The company became part the Sara Lee Corporation which opened up new opportunities . . . and the question of whether to stay in the US. Brian said: “We decided with ageing parents we wanted to come back to the UK. I came to London and became MD of Playtex in the UK. My career from then became much more about marketing and branding. My first big marketing project was launching the Wonderbra brand which was a phenomenal success.”

Brian’s career took an unexpected turn when he decided to go back to college to do a degree in contemporary music.

“I never expected to get to the end of it” Brian said “but I wanted to do something I’d always aspired to. Then along came the opportunity to become president of Ralph Lauren. That’s what took me to Geneva for nine years. I had a few more years then came to London. I enjoyed it but there was constant travel: New York Europe the Middle East. I left with a view to go into a private equity-owned business which eventually led me to join the group I’m with today.”

“The firm has increased its spending on technology from $400 million annually pre-pandemic to $500 million in the 2022 fiscal year” a Raymond James spokesperson said.

The news was initially announced by Raymond James CEO Paul Reilly earlier this month during the Elevate National Conference in Nashville. He said the investment would be used toward enhancing cybersecurity and Raymond James’ applications.

Technology has long been at the forefront of Raymond James’ priorities. The primary investment has been on improving the communication between advisors and clients and protecting a client’s assets.

The firm recently named a new chief information security officer Todd Ferguson. He focuses on “securing the firm’s enterprise technology platform and continually improving its technology risk posture while maintaining alignment and transparency with Raymond James’ enterprise risk framework” as well as “further enhancement of our defense-in-depth security strategy.”

In terms of enhancements to applications the Raymond James team said its client access mobile app is continuously being updated to facilitate interactions between advisors and their clients such as adding a video communication feature.

“Unlike some competitor apps it connects clients to their advisor rather than directly to their bank. By having clients and advisors view the same information the app aims to make conversations about financial goals more efficient and clear” a spokesperson said.

A look at the recently announced technologies Raymond James has invested in:

A practice exchange succession planning platform: This cloud-based tool powered by FindBob is designed to be the one-stop source on the succession planning process for advisors. The platform has merger and acquisition tools prospective buyer/seller matching and succession planning education.

An alerts portal: This portal consolidates department and practices notifications into one dashboard.

Proposal tool for financial advisors: The tool provides investment data analysis a prospect’s referrals or portfolio and proposed investment changes. It can search screen and compare financial product attributes. It also monitors and compares portfolio performance over time.

Enhancements to its digital marketing capabilities.

Today the company has approximately 8500 financial advisors and $1.26 trillion in total client assets according to its website.

The latest quarterly earnings report shows Raymond James had net revenues of $2.67 billion and net income of $323 million or $1.52 per diluted share for the fiscal second quarter that ended March 31. Excluding $11 million of acquisition-related expenses quarterly adjusted net income was $331 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2h1YXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy1tZW1vcmlhbHMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy8yMDIyLzA1LzI4L2RvbmFsZC1yYXltb25kLWFsbGFyZC0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Donald Raymond Allard | News Sports Jobs,"Donald Raymond Allard 87 died peacefully on Sunday morning May 22 2022 at the Community Hospice House surrounded by his loving family.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

Chip designer NVIDIA Corporation has revealed that its graphics processing unit (GPU) inventory stabilized during the previous quarter. The statements were made by NVIDIA's chief financial officer (CFO) Ms. Colette Kress during NVIDIA's investor call for its earnings release for its first quarter of the fiscal year 2023 during which the company managed to strongly grow its revenues and increase its earnings from the crucial data center segment as well. As part of the commentary released prior to the call the executive also explained that her company's inventory costs had grown in the quarter as it navigated a tricky supply chain and semiconductor environment in the wake of pandemic-induced disruptions.

NVIDIA CFO Expects GPU Inventory To Remain Stable During This Quarter

The first fiscal quarter saw NVIDIA increase its revenue by an impressive 46% annually to stand at $8.3 billion which marked a new overall record alongside all time highs for the company's gaming and data center segments.

NVIDIA's results also provided key details about the current state of the semiconductor and GPU market which has had to recently contend not only with dissatisfied gamers being unable to get their hands on the latest products but also with the wild swings in the cryptocurrency market.

These reveal that as far as gamers are concerned the inventory situation can stabilize during the current quarter. While Ms. Kress's comments as part of the earnings release did not specifically mention channel inventories she did share important details during her analyst session.

Prior to the call the earnings release outlined that NVIDIA had to deal with longer lead times in its supply chains. Lead time in the business world refers to the time taken for inventory to arrive at a company after it has placed an order and the CFO explained that her company's long term purchase obligations more than doubled annually as a result of the time increase. Supply uncertainty and shortage often cause companies to order higher quantities at higher rates but these decisions carry the risk of an oversupply that results in excess inventory.

Keeping these facts in mind Ms. Kress's comments during the analyst call were telling as she explained that NVIDIA is witnessing stability in channel inventory. Channel inventory refers to the products that are available with NVIDIA's retail partners but have not been sold to consumers.

During the call the executive explained that:

Channel inventory has nearly normalized and we expect it to remain around these levels in Q2. The extent in which cryptocurrency mining contributed to Gaming demand is difficult for us to quantify with any reasonable degree of precision.

These statements build upon her earlier comments and several reports that have consistently surfaced throughout the course of this year. For instance Ms. Kress outlined in January that she expects supply shortages to ease out by the second half of this year. At the same time she was also careful to mention that the demand for her GeForce products remained strong; a factor that will become important as you read below.

Another report from Australia that came to light in March revealed that some NVIDIA GPUs saw their prices drop by as much as 35% indicating that retailers were eager to sell them potentially due to an oversupply.

When taken together it just might turn out to be that in its eagerness to meet market demand and minimize shortage costs NVIDIA has ordered excess GPUs and sent them to its channel partners. Combined with the fact that the company's next generation RTX 40 GPUs might hit the market later this year the risk of an oversupply in the market that results in excess inventory is present.

Additionally if the high demand for its products experienced over the past couple of months resulted in NVIDIA increasing its shipments then the risk of the excess products remaining unsold might also materialize. Unable to get their hands on the GPUs the company's potential customers can have switched to alternatives or decided to wait for newer products but since the inventory has been updated to reflect the increased demand the drop in interest is another factor that can contribute to an oversupply. This is compounded by the fact that newer products such as those mentioned above have been rumored to launch either this year or the next.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84NjUwNy9tc2ktdW52ZWlscy1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLXN1cHJpbS1hc3Nhc3NpbnMtY3JlZWQtdmFsaGFsbGEtZ3B1L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSI unveils GeForce RTX 3080 SUPRIM X Assassin's Creed Valhalla GPU,"MSI must have a big stock of GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards as it is getting rid of a bunch of them with a new branded version for a game that I'm sure barely anyone plays anymore.

AstroForge a Y Combinator startup has secured a seat on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on a ridesharing basis after closing a seed funding round worth US$13 million. The flight aboard a Falcon 9 which is scheduled for next year is the first of two space missions that AstroForge is eyeing up. Per TweakTown and TechCrunch this initial mission will be a demonstration for which the company has partnered with OrbAstro to build a satellite.

AstroForge was founded by two ex-NASA SpaceX and Virgin Orbit employees. The company is looking to exploit small asteroids ranging from 20 m (65.6 ft) to 1.5 Km (0.93 miles) in diameter that are rich in Plutonium group metals like rhodium in the near-Earth orbit.

While we don’t know exactly how the startup will mine asteroids that small AstroForge has hinted that the technology it is developing will use a high-rated vacuum in zero gravity and not require landing on the asteroid. The company has already shortlisted close to a million possible asteroids.

Despite the countless challenges associated with mining asteroids AstroForge is hopeful that it will start mining before the decade ends.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 will be the next-generation high-end gaming graphics card offering the latest graphics architecture based on Ada Lovelace GPUs. The graphics card will be replacing the RTX 3070 a very popular gaming graphics card in the $500-$600 US segment.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Card - Purely Designed For Enthusiast Gamers

[Updated- 04/09/22]

While there's no denying the enthusiasm around the higher-end GeForce RTX 4090 & GeForce RTX 4080 series graphics cards that offer the best of the best gaming performance the RTX 4070 series graphics cards will be designed around the $500 US segment which is a high-end price range that still offers lots of performance at hand. It's simple the RTX 4090 series will be aimed at users who want the best of the best without worrying about the amount of money they are spending while the RTX 4080 series is aimed at users who want the best gaming performance at the best possible price. The RTX 4070 will be the sweet spot for high-end gaming offering a buttery smooth 2K game experience.

The previous GeForce RTX 3070 was touted to offer a huge improvement over the RTX 2070 and was said to offer performance faster than the RTX 2080 Ti but ended up mostly on par with the Turing flagship with only the RTX 3070 Ti exceeding the performance of the previous Turing GPU flagship. It looks like the RTX 4070 will be placed in a similar position where it might offer graphics performance on par or close to the RTX 3080 Ti but a 'Ti' variant going further ahead in graphics performance.

We should expect similar things with the next-generation gaming solution too but an important factor to consider is that GPUs are becoming more power-hungry and more pricey. It is a trend that might continue into the future as we get better products but in return there's always a cost to pay for end consumers. So starting with what we know so far first we should take a look at the brand new Ada Lovelace or AD10* class GPUs that will be powering the next-gen GeForce RTX 40 series cards.

You can also read the expected specs prices and performance of other upcoming RTX 40 GPUs in the posts below:

NVIDIA's AD104 'Ada Lovelace' GPU - The Next-Gen Powerhouse

Starting with the GPU configuration the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 series graphics cards are said to utilize the AD104 GPU core. The GPU is said to measure around 300mm2 and will utilize the TSMC 4N process node which is an optimized version of TSMC's 5nm (N5) node designed for the green team.

The NVIDIA Ada Lovelace AD104 GPU is expected to feature up to 5 GPC (Graphics Processing Clusters). This is the one less GPC than the GA104 GPU. Each GPU will consist of 6 TPCs and 2 SMs which is the same configuration as the existing chip. Each SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) will house four sub-cores which is also the same as the GA102 GPU. What's changed is the FP32 & the INT32 core configuration. Each sub-core will include 128 FP32 units but combined FP32+INT32 units will go up to 192. This is because the FP32 units don't share the same sub-core as the IN32 units. The 128 FP32 cores are separate from the 64 INT32 cores.

So in total each sub-core will consist of 32 FP32 plus 16 INT32 units for a total of 48 units. Each SM will have a total of 128 FP32 units plus 64 INT32 units for a total of 192 units. And since there are a total of 60 SM units (12 per GPC) we are looking at 7680 FP32 Units and 3840 INT32 units for a total of 11520 cores. Each SM will also include two Wrap Schedules (32 thread/CLK) for 64 wraps per SM. This is a 50% increase on the cores (FP32+INT32) and a 33% increase in Wraps/Threads vs the GA102 GPU.

Moving over to the cache this is another segment where NVIDIA has given a big boost over the existing Ampere GPUs. The Ada Lovelace GPUs will pack 192 KB of L1 cache per SM an increase of 50% over Ampere. That's a total of 2 MB of L1 cache on the top AD104 GPU. The L2 cache will be increased to 48 MB as mentioned in the leaks. This is a 12x increase over the Ampere GA104 GPU that hosts just 4 MB of L2 cache. The cache will be shared across the GPU.

Finally we have the ROPs which are also increased to 32 per GPC an increase of 2x over Ampere. You are looking at up to 160 ROPs versus just 96 on the GA104 Ampere GPU. There are also going to be the latest 4th Generation Tensor and 3rd Generation RT (Raytracing) cores infused on the Ada Lovelace GPUs which will help boost DLSS & Raytracing performance to the next level. Overall the Ada Lovelace AD103 GPU will offer:

5 GPCs vs 6 GPCs on GA104

+25% Cores vs GA104 GPU

50% More L1 Cache (Versus Ampere GA104)

Twice More L2 Cache (Versus Ampere GA104)

+66% ROPs (Versus Ampere GA104)

4th Gen Tensor & 3rd Gen RT Cores

Do note that clock speeds which are said to be between the 2-3 GHz range aren't taken into the equation so they will also play a major role in improving the per-core performance versus Ampere.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Specifications

As we saw with the GA104 GPU NVIDIA can have various configurations of the AD104 GPU for its GeForce RTX 4070 series lineup. We realistically expect there to be two variants the RTX 4070 and the RTX 4070 Ti. The former will be part of the initial lineup while the latter would launch as a mid-cycle refresh. The most entry-level GeForce RTX 30 had 23% fewer cores compared to the full chip but this time the '80-class' graphics cards are going to be powered by their own chip rather than relying on the AD102 GPU that the flagships use. As such we can expect anywhere from 6144 to the full 7680 core configuration.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 'Expected' Specifications

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 is going to be a cut-down configuration with a slightly higher core count than the RTX 3070 TI (6144 cores) allowing some room for a 'Ti' variant in the future with the full-fat configuration. The core count is expected to be 7168 which means 56 of the 60 SMs will be enabled. The GPU will come packed with 48 MB of L2 cache and up to 160 ROPs which is simply insane.

The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range. The higher than usual clock speed bump comes from the fact that NVIDIA is making a two-node jump considering the Ampere GPUs with Samsung 8nm node was in reality a 10nm process node with some optimizations. NVIDIA is skipping 7nm and going straight for a 5nm node and not even the vanilla variant but an optimized version of it. With Pascal on the TSMC 16nm node NVIDIA delivered a huge frequency leap and we can expect a similar jump this time around too.

As for memory specs the GeForce RTX 4070 is expected to rock 10 GB GDDR6 capacities that are said to be clocked at 18 Gbps speeds across a 160-bit bus interface. The card may rock a TBP of 300W and the leaker also mentions that the pricing of this card would not be lower than the RTX 3070 or 3070 Ti graphics cards. Simply put we can expect a price bump in the '70' class graphics segment.

As for its feature set the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics cards will rock all the modern NV feature sets such as the latest 4th Gen Tensor Cores 3rd gen RT cores and the latest NVENC Encoder and NVCDEC Decoder and support for the latest APIs. They will pack all the modern RTX features such as DLSS Reflex Broadcast Resizable-BAR Freestyle Ansel Highlights Shadowplay and G-SYNC support too.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Performance

As for the performance of the gaming GPUs we can only use theoretical numbers here since the launch is a bit far away but based on what we know the RTX 40 series cards might be the first gaming cards to hit the 100 TFLOPs compute horsepower limit.

Just for comparison's sake:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti: ~103 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)

~103 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090: ~90 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)

~90 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080: ~50 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)

~50 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 40 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.86 GHz Boost clock)

40 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.86 GHz Boost clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti: ~38 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)

~38 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070: ~36 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)

~36 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: 36 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.69 GHz Boost clock)

36 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.69 GHz Boost clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080: 30 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.71 GHz Boost clock)

30 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.71 GHz Boost clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti: 22 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock)

22 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: 20 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.72 GHz Boost clock)

Based on a theoretical clock speed of 2.5 GHz you get up to 36 TFLOPs of compute performance and the rumors are suggesting even higher boost clocks. Now these are definitely sounding like peak clocks similar to AMD's peak frequencies which are higher than the average 'Game' clock. A 36+ TFLOPs compute performance means more performance on a '70-class' GPU than an '80-class flagship' which will be a good bump. But one should keep in mind that compute performance doesn't necessarily indicate the overall gaming performance.

FP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better) Compute Power 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 RTX 4090 Ti (Theoretical) 100 RTX 4090 (Theoretical) 90 RTX 4080 (Theoretical) 50 RTX 3090 Ti 40 RTX 4070 Ti 38 RTX 4070 36 RTX 3090 36 RTX 3080 30 RX 6900 XTX 25 RTX 3070 Ti 22 RTX 3070 20 Xbox Series X 12 PlayStation 5 10

This will be around a 80% compute performance uplift for the GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card versus its predecessor and this is without even factoring in the RT and Tensor core performance which is expected to get major lifts too in their respective department. Now FLOPs aren't necessarily reflective of the graphics or gaming performance but they do provide a metric that can be used for comparison.

Gamers should expect 2K gaming to be buttery smooth on these graphics cards and with DLSS we might even see playable 60 FPS at 4K resolution with DLSS enabled. But to be realistic 1440p game titles would be the sweet spot for this graphics card.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Price & Availability

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 was launched at $499 US but its refreshes have really messed up the prices. The RTX 3070 Ti launched at $599 US a $100 US premium over the standard model but not offering a big enough performance boost to make the extra $ worth it.

NVIDIA really needs to secure more gamers in the $500 US segment but they have to deliver a product that's worth the price. The RTX 2070 and RTX 3070 were a little underwhelming & while they did manage to close the gap with the previous-gen flagship they still couldn't recapture the glory of the GTX 1070 which was a good bit ahead of the flagship Titan's that preceded it or the absolutely amazing price point of the GTX 970. With the performance leaps that are expected from the Ada Lovelace architecture the RTX 4070 has the potential to become one stellar graphics card option in the $500 US price range. Also if NVIDIA can simply ignore the refresh and give us a full-fat GA104 configuration at the $500 price point that would be an insane value and one of the best graphics card in its class for some time to come.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards are rumored for a mid-July reveal and a launch is expected in Q3 2022 so we will know for sure what NVIDIA is up to in the next few months.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

In the age of Hollywood it's a rare commodity to find friendships that can span longer than the entirety of working on a film or TV show together. But some people just seem to click. Take Sandra Bullock and George Lopez for example. From the outside it almost seems like The Lost City actress/producer and the comedian behind the upcoming NBC sitcom Lopez vs. Lopez would have almost nothing to do with each other. After all she's best known as a movie star and his bread and butter is TV comedies.

As it turns out the two have quite a bit of history together — more than two decades of it in fact. The duo's friendship actually dates back to 2000 when Sandra's production company Fortis Films was looking to showcase Latinx talent in the form of a network TV show. Enter George who at that point was working the comedy circuit and hadn't made a splash as a comedian.

The two reportedly met at an improv show in Brea California. According to People Sandra drove an hour from L.A. to Orange County to sit in the crowd and watch George up on stage. Fast forward two years later George was the leadman of his own hit series George Lopez and

""From the time Sandy and I first laid eyes on each other she has been nothing but a person of her word and embracing of me and my family” George told People in a 2010 interview. “We always trade off poses like gang poses. It's beautiful. I love her!”

Now aside from Sandra being George Lopez's executive producer fans may also recognize her for portraying a rather clumsy character — Accident Amy who was prone to just getting hurt while on the job at Powers Aviation. When asked by her Lost City costar Channing Tatum in a March 2022 Wired interview about why she chose to be on the show her answer was nothing if not frank.

""Because I produced The George Lopez Show"" she said. ""Any chance I got to be Accident Amy on The George Lopez Show I took it ... I think it brought him such great pleasure to see like a hammer hit my head.”

But their friendship spans more than just comedy and starring on a TV show together. The duo has been there for each other through the highs and the lows. George not only knew about Sandra secretly adopting her son Louis when news about her ex-husband's alleged infidelity broke in 2010 he stepped up and visited his friend at her then-Hollywood Hills home to make sure she was OK.

“She’s my fairy godmother” George told E!’s Daily 10 in 2010 according to People. “She knows how much I care about her. When times are tough friends step up.”

Now we know Bullock doesn't live on social media and as far as we can tell George hasn't featured his long-time friend on his official Instagram account. But that doesn't mean we won't see them together in the future again. After all Sandra did make an appearance on George's first TV show. Who's to say she won't bring back another version of Accident Amy to his new one?

The April 22 episode “Fool’s Gold” found Atwater reaching out to Celeste one last time to make amends for what went down during their short-lived romance.

More from TVLine

As you’ll recall the pair met at a bar hooked up and began dating. Since Celeste was a social activist who was critical of police Atwater lied about his job and continued to see her while pretending to be a regular citizen. When she finally found out she was more hurt that he lied to her than him being a cop and their relationship ended. Celeste has been ignoring Atwater’s calls since then.

Chicago PD

In “Fool’s Gold” he left a final heartfelt apology on her voicemail and resolved to never bother her again. Given everything that happened so far LaRoyce Hawkins who plays Atwater says the Intelligence cop will surely learn from his mistakes.

“Atwater definitely needs love but he’s also not wanting to force anything. You can’t force a vibe. If it was meant to be it will be” he tells TVLine. “If [Celeste] has a hard time understanding his intentions behind why he couldn’t be as vulnerable with her as she probably would like for him to be he has to take that and keep growing from it… When we find Atwater in his next situation as we watch him play the field moving forward he’ll be a lot more vulnerable.”

So where does this leave them? Can we expect to see Celeste back on the show or are they done for good?

“It might be” Hawkins notes. “I can’t say whether we’ll see her again. I would love to see her again but I’m not sure. I’m looking forward to whatever happens.”

Regardless of what happens between them the actor says that “Celeste will always be a big part of Atwater. We’ll see her in the decisions that he makes moving forward. She’s going to have a hold on him a little bit.”

Experts say there is the potential for people living anywhere in the Americas to see an extremely rare meteor storm on Memorial Day after the sun goes down.

The meteors may be visible as Earth passes through the remains of a comet that split apart three decades ago and is still fragmenting CBS Denver reports. The comet — named ""Schwassmann-Wachmann 3"" — began to break up in 1995 and its debris is expected to intersect with the Earth's orbit which could result in an intense meteor shower called Tau Herculids.

A meteor shower is classified as a meteor storm when at least 1000 meteors per hour are produced.

""If it actually passes through this broken up trail you could see a lot of meteors every hour"" Fraser Cain publisher of the astronomy outlet ""Universe Today"" told KCBS Radio.

However Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society says the meteors entering the atmosphere must be larger than normal in order to be seen from the ground.

Because of that Lunsford says the meteor shower is highly unlikely — but he adds: ""We believe that this event has a chance of being something spectacular and that we would be remiss by not publicizing it.""

According to EarthSky.org the famous Leonid meteor storm of 1966 produced meteors falling at a rate of 40 meteors per second. Witnesses said they felt like they had to clutch the ground because of the impression of Earth moving through space.

NASA says astronomers have been observing the comet for nearly a century and the comet's trajectory and path around the sun is well understood.

""Amateur and professional astronomers around the world have been tracking its spectacular disintegration for years"" NASA said.

Elon Musk the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla topped Fortune‘s new list of the most highly compensated CEOs on the Fortune 500. In 2021 Musk “realized” compensation worth almost $23.5 billion from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018 multiyear “moonshot” grant. That was—by far—the biggest CEO payday in 2021 according to our new analysis of how Fortune 500 CEOs are compensated.

After Musk the 10 most highly compensated Fortune 500 CEOs of 2021 are all tech and biotech CEOs including the heads of Apple Netflix and Microsoft. The full list is below.

CEO pay dwarfs that of the average employee. The average big-company CEO made 351 times the pay of the average worker on a realized basis in 2020 according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) which has tracked the metric for decades up from a 21-to-1 ratio back in 1965.

Our analysis evaluated the pay packages of 280 Fortune 500 CEOs who earned a median total compensation of $15.9 million up 30% from a year earlier. When calculating a CEO’s total realized pay we measured the following for the company’s most recent fiscal year: salary and bonuses; other compensation such as vested restricted stock grants long-term incentive payouts and perks; and stock gains in the form of value realized from exercising stock options. Because the value of unexercised options is unpredictable we did not consider them in our tabulation of total compensation.

Here are the highest-paid CEOs.

1. Elon Musk Tesla: $23.5 billion

Musk the founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla “realized” compensation worth almost $23.5 billion in 2021 from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018.

Tesla ranked 65 on this year’s Fortune 500. The company had a blockbuster 2021 bringing in $53.8 billion in revenue up 71% from 2020 and expanding significantly into key European and Chinese markets. Tesla delivered 936000 vehicles in 2021 an 87% increase that puts the company at the pinnacle of the global EV industry with a 14% market share.

Musk did not respond to Fortune‘s requests for comment.

2. Tim Cook Apple: $770.5 million

Cook has been CEO of Apple Inc. since 2011. He earned $770.5 million in 2021 alone mostly as a part of a 10-year grant of shares worth $1.7 billion. But his incredible pay package may be justified by Apple’s stock market performance under Cook: The tech company’s market value during his tenure has increased by $2.2 trillion.

Apple ranks 3 on the Fortune 500. The company faced challenges because of the global chip shortage but successfully began manufacturing the equipment in-house. Apple finished the year with a gargantuan $95 billion in profits—outperforming every other U.S. company on that front.

Apple declined to comment on Fortune‘s analysis.

3. Jensen Huang NVIDIA $561 million

San Francisco: Elon Musk the multi-billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX highest paid executive in the world. Musk has topped the Fortune’s new list of the most highly compensated CEOs on the Fortune 500. In 2021 Musk “realized” compensation worth almost USD 23.5 billion from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018 multiyear “moonshot” grant. “That was—by far—the biggest CEO payday in 2021” Fortune’s report said citing an analysis of how Fortune 500 CEOs are compensated.

After Musk the 10 most highly compensated Fortune 500 CEOs of 2021 are all tech and biotech CEOs including the heads of Apple Netflix  and Microsoft.

RF,Regions Financial Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoZW5vbWVuYWx3b3JsZC5vcmcvYW5hbHlzaXMvZmFybWxhbmQtYXNzZXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Farmland Assets,"The election of Jair Bolsonaro in 2018 commenced a long agenda of environmental destruction in Brazil. Before taking office Bolsonaro had openly threatened Indigenous communities with racist attacks commenting that Indigenous peoples should not have “an inch of land” and that “Indians in reserves are like animals in zoos.” Targeting the land rights of Indigenous peoples peasants and quilombolas (rural Afro-Brazilian communities) he articulated a neocolonial agenda to control the land and natural resources of rural communities.

Such encroachment on rural communities predates Bolsonaro and it intersects closely with global crises of climate change and food production. Industrial agriculture has been a driver of climate change with chemical inputs destroying local soil and water sources. In Brazil widespread fires in the Amazon the Pantanal wetlands and the Cerrado the most biodiverse savanna in the world have been unprecedented in their number and scale in recent years.

The expansion of industrial agriculture in Brazil has been an international affair linking pension funds university endowments and major financial actors across the world. After the global financial crisis of 2008 international agribusiness and financial corporations formed alliances with rural oligarchies to operate in the Brazilian farmland market. In recent years mergers and joint ventures have changed the profile of agribusiness in the country. Land purchases are no longer limited to large-scale Brazilian companies or even foreign agricultural corporations. Now financial firms and oil companies have prominent roles in the market as major sources of capital. The entrance of these firms has unleashed new forms of speculation within land markets with expanded access to credit and therefore land purchases. These practices have led to devastating new realities for those living through the changes.

Land grabbing in the Cerrado

The Cerrado the vast savanna region in the western part of the country has an area of approximately two million kilometers representing almost a quarter of Brazil’s territory. Its trees are important sources of underground water such as the Guarani Bambuí and Urucuia aquifers which contribute to the formation of two-thirds of Brazil’s hydrographic regions.

Central to water and food production the Cerrado has been a target of an especially predatory form of agricultural real estate speculation. Many of the industrial farms now operating in the chapadas (high plains) were established in areas that were once public lands making up the homes of peasant Indigenous and quilombola communities. Upon moving into these regions agribusiness corporations take advantage of local operators by illegally forging ownership fencing off the farmland and displacing local communities. Recent legislation introduced by Bolsonaro aims to further facilitate the privatization of public lands. This process named land grabbing by local activists also affects the baixões (lowlands) which also have a long history of housing rural communities.

Drastic environmental changes have accompanied land grabbing in the region with major implications for land use. Land previously used to cultivate food crops for local consumption now grows commodities—in many cases sugarcane for ethanol production and soybean are grown in monocropping plantations. As a resident of a quilombola community in the northeastern Brazilian state of Piauí explained in a Network for Social Justice and Human Rights interview “We used to live off of fishing and farming. I can still remember the smell of rice when it was being harvested. But now we can no longer grow our crops.”

Water pollution and deforestation are now widespread; the heavy use of pesticides and other chemical inputs sprayed by tractors and airplanes have destroyed local water and food supplies. “The water from the highlands flows down and fills our streams with agro-toxins. The water gets muddy it stinks. In the river we see the little fish floating on top of the water dead. I didn’t see the little fish dead before. When we go fishing now if we go in the morning it takes us until noon to catch a little fish. There are no more fish in the river because of the poison” stated one resident. Deforestation has caused the extinction of endangered species and polluted river springs affecting biodiversity and rainfall patterns.

Soybean plantations have destroyed many water sources leading rivers to dry up across the region. With monocropping extending into forest areas fires have become more frequent. A resident of the local community described “We are very concerned with the burnings because the fire destroys all the flora the pequi flower burns the cashew burns it burns the trees that provide food. The fires also cause damage to streams our streams are no longer filling.”

Financialization of farmland

The devastation in the Cerrado is not simply the result of the outsized presence of domestic agribusiness. The industry’s financial support can be traced to an intricate web of capital flows connecting funds in New York London Germany and other financial centers in the Global North to Brazil-based firms.

Beginning in 2002 agribusiness corporations in Brazil started to take advantage of high commodity prices for products such as sugarcane in international markets. Companies began contracting debt in US dollars with the expectation of increasing future exports and the mills negotiated export contracts in future markets to justify their territorial expansion and mechanization. This inflated the price of agricultural land. At the same time promises of future production by companies that had previous debts fueled new indebtedness and further territorial expansion. The cycle continued—the strategy of financing existing debts with new funds based on futures markets intensified the scale of industrial agriculture and therefore the use of natural resources. Brazil is already home to one of the highest concentrations of land ownership in the world—one percent of large landowners control 90 percent of agricultural land—and industrial agriculture has led to even greater concentration of rural property ownership.

The global financial crisis of 2008 marked a watershed for agricultural expansion. The price of sugar began to fall along with agriculture commodity prices and several Brazilian sugarcane companies went bankrupt. While government support for commodities aimed to achieve a positive balance of trade the fall in commodity prices led to trade deficits. But this drop did not hurt the land market as some would have expected. Brazilian agricultural companies began to court international markets for access to credit. Land prices continued to rise attracting the attention of international finance. The flow of financial capital into farmland markets generated speculative bubbles and sharp escalations in land and food prices with the burdens shifted mostly to rural communities.

Before 2008 the possibility of a growing global demand for ethanol was used to justify the territorial expansion and monocropping of the sugar-energy industry—sugarcane increasingly replaced local food crops as large corporations took over smaller farms. The global financial crisis however led forecasts to change. Ethanol’s economic viability on a large scale depends on market conditions of two major international commodities—sugar and oil—making ethanol function not as a “leading” but a “supporting” commodity in this context. But given the instability of financial and commodity markets ethanol was no longer projected to provide energy security in Brazil nor internationally.

Despite these consequential market shifts agribusiness corporations still present themselves as engines of economic development in a commodity-oriented economy. In return they demand state subsidies for expanding monocropping plantations. The large corporations of the industry commonly measure their contribution to national development by estimating the role of industrial agriculture in Brazilian GDP; they usually place that number between 30 and 40 percent. But this percentage is inflated by the inclusion of “productive chains” which encompass agrochemical industrial commercialization and retail activities outside of agricultural production itself. The GDP contributions do not consider the various forms of public subsidies unpaid debt and other economic social and environmental impacts.

Over several decades the agribusiness lobby has continued to receive large amounts of state-subsidized credit to expand plantations in areas with access to infrastructure vast hydrographic basins and biodiversity. Even though small farmers produce 70 percent of food for local markets large agribusiness corporations received the vast majority of approximately US$46 billion in subsidized credit available for farmers in 2021.

Even with receiving a steady flow of subsidized credit the industry has historically generated public debt. Back in 1980 the Brazilian government forgave a US$13 billion debt to agriculture corporations representing twice the amount of the trade balance for agriculture at that time. Though indebtedness has persisted access to various types of subsidies and tax incentives has endured. In 1999 the Brazilian government forgave a US$18 billion debt a year when the announced trade surplus for the agribusiness sector was US$10 billion. Sixteen years later in 2015 while the country was in the midst of an economic crisis subsidized credit provided by the state program Plano Safra increased by 20 percent compared to the previous year reaching R$180 billion reais. Data from the Ministry of Agriculture show that this amount was equivalent to the trade balance of agribusiness in 2014—US$80 billion dollars at an average exchange rate of 2.5— excluding agribusiness debts. In the 2014-2015 harvest period the debt of sugar and ethanol corporations alone exceeded R$50 billion which represented a 12 percent increase compared to the previous year.

The role of TIAA

A key case for understanding this trend in farmland speculation—and its transformation following the global financial crisis—is Radar Agricultural Properties. The rural real estate company was founded in 2008 as a joint venture between the largest sugarcane corporation in Brazil Cosan (with 18.9 percent of shares) and a financial company Mansilla which was the main shareholder at that time. Data from 2012 indicates that Radar controlled 151468 hectares of farmland in Brazil estimated at R$2.35 billion in Brazilian currency or $1 billion in US dollars.

Radar has a surprising source of capital: TIAA a pension fund manager for employees in academic government non-profit and research fields in the United States. Assets under TIAA’s management are valued at approximately US$1 trillion. For its speculation in global farmland TIAA collects capital from other sources in the United States Europe and Canada such as funds AP2 in Sweden Caisse de Dépôts et Placement du Québec British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (bcIMC) Stichting Pensionenfonds AEP in the Netherlands Ärzteversorung WestfalenLippe in Germany Cummins UK Pension Plan Trustee Ltd. Environment Agency Pension Fund and Greater Manchester Pension Fund in England and New Mexico State Investment Council in the United States.

To operate in Brazil TIAA uses Brazilian subsidiaries Mansilla Tellus and Nova Gaia Brasil Participações to comply with a Brazilian law that limits foreign ownership of land. In 2020 the National Land Institute INCRA investigated TIAA’s acquisitions of farmland and argued that TIAA violated Brazilian ownership laws because TIAA and its Brazilian subsidies are part of the same economic group. INCRA recommended that all of the lands purchased via TIAA’s subsidiaries since 2010 covering more than 150000 hectares be annulled and void.

Through TIAA’s investments of their pension funds staff and faculty at US institutions are tied to environmental destruction in Brazil. The role of US higher education in the country broadens when considering the activities of university endowments. Harvard University for example acquired agriculture land by using subsidiaries including Terracal Caracol Agropecuária and Insolo Agroindustrial to operate in the Brazil’s rural real estate markets. By 2016 the university had acquired more than 405000 hectares—twice the size of Massachusetts’ total farmland area. In October 2020 the State Court of Bahia issued a sentence blocking the registration of lands for one of Harvard’s largest farmland acquisitions in Brazil a 107000 hectare agglomeration of lands known as Gleba Campo Largo. To avoid legal consequences Harvard transferred its farmland division to a private equity corporation called Solum Partners a partner of AIG insurance group. It’s likely that INCRA’s criticism applies to Harvard: the university’s new subsidiaries may not actually comply with Brazilian law.

Through this mechanism international corporations can “outsource” their land deals forming several companies with the same administrators and making it appear that they pertain to different owners. The “outsourcing” mechanism has other implications for transparency: with several interrelated subsidiaries companies obscure the locations of the farms they control as well as their social and environmental impacts.

The pure scale of foreign investment carries major consequences for the price of rural real estate. By creating specific funds to invest in farmland markets a large pension fund like TIAA can inflate land prices so that they no longer reflect commodity prices. In 2012 land prices rose by an average of 56 percent and Radar’s portfolio increased by 93 percent compared to 2011. With TIAA’s backing Radar currently owns 555 properties in Brazil with approximately 270000 hectares of land at a declared value of R$5.2 billion.

The price of land

The entrance of pension funds and endowments as financial backers has revealed a stark disconnect between land and commodities. Commodities such as sugarcane soybean corn cotton and eucalyptus continue to rationalize land prices but in fact it is Brazil’s massive land area—the fifth largest in the world—which has become the main financial asset. This is indicated through the trajectory and production of the sugarcane industry. Though sugarcane plantations saw a decline in productivity after 2010 their territorial expansion and the concentration of that expansion among few landowners persisted. In 2011-2012 the industry acquired even more territory while sugar production stayed the same.

The commodities production that justifies the land acquisitions has upended life for many rural workers. The industrialization of the sugarcane sector has increased unemployment and for those who remain employed it has lowered wages. In the state of São Paolo for instance the rural worker population declined from 440000 in 1986 to 94000 in 2014. In the early 2000s sugarcane cutters saw both their pay per ton and daily wage slashed as a result of mechanization. The “ethanol boom” of this period was accompanied by an alarming increase in the deaths of sugar workers mostly attributed to poor labor conditions.

In areas where monocropping has been introduced frequent assassinations target Indigenous residents particularly those seeking to protect public lands from encroachment. Rural activists who for generations have struggled to secure collective land rights are now organizing with greater urgency against constant threats of violence. The very presence of these communities has become an obstacle for the financialization and thus the devastation of land.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“I’m the Coordinator of the Security Teams at the Ngaragba Central Prison in Bangui the capital of Central African Republic (CAR).

This is the largest and most notorious prison in the country with some 1335 inmates which accounts for 69 per cent of the entire prison population in the country.

My main task is to work with national partners in order to build their capacities to maintain law and order and effective justice systems; this is a key function of peacekeeping.

As the main trainer and coordinator of rapid intervention activities I and my team of 42 officers support national prison staff in incident and crisis management.

I have introduced rapid intervention training modules into the national curriculum of CAR’s prison administration.

MINUSCA/Hervé Serefio A simulation exercise on the management of a riot by inmates takes place in Ngaragba Prison in the Central African Republic.

Male-dominated environment

The field of security is a typically male-dominated environment where women are often placed second or even ignored because of stereotypical perceptions that men are better suited for the job.

I had the courage and strength and vocation to break down barriers and assert myself confidently in this field.

I believe that a key factor in my success as the main trainer and coordinator of the rapid intervention activities at Ngaragba Prison is my perseverance. Where other colleagues resist I volunteer to lead.

This has helped reduce certain prejudices about the capabilities of women in this work environment. I give maximum effort to the tasks entrusted to me; often more than male colleagues.

Today my colleagues admire my work and encourage me to move forward. This has made other women from MINUSCA and the CAR prison administration more interested with some women opting to train and work in rapid intervention.

To help increase the number of women deployed in non-traditional roles I organize team meetings where I sensitize women to take an active part in the tasks that some consider are (better suited for) men.

I invite women to take part in training that aims to give them opportunities and allow them into spaces that were once considered men’s domain. I also entrust them with tasks in the same way as men.

My proudest achievement is the recruitment and initial training of 300 civilian professional prison officers including five women who are part of the prison administration’s rapid intervention team set up in 2022.

By setting an example as the Commander of the Rapid Response Team of MINUSCA’s Corrections Unit I am changing the position and perception of women… in the field of security.

Together with all the other women pioneers we have a responsibility to carry the torch and break down gender stereotypes prejudices and barriers against women in the field of corrections and security.”

The Celtics will have Marcus Smart and Robert Williams available against the Heat in Game 7 but the Heat will have reinforcements as well — Tyler Herro will return after missing three games with a groin injury.

Smart and Williams have played the last two games and will finish the series on the floor for a banged-up Celtics team. Both will start.

Celtics coach Ime Udoka was asked about Williams who has started the last two games but then was on the bench to start the second half of each game.

“He warms up well before games to get ready and at times during the half he wants to get a little more loose” Udoka said. “Strictly physical. Nothing game plan-wise. We are comfortable going with either and if he needs a little bit more time we give it to him.”

Herro reportedly was supposed to miss 2-to-4 weeks with his injury but he made major improvements in recent days per the team.

“He’s really been working diligently the last few days” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Each day he’s made significant improvement and he was able to do shootaround this morning but more importantly he was able to do things in the training room and pass those tests to be available.”

Statistically Herro has a net rating of -19.3 against the Celtics in the playoffs up from his net rating of -23.1 in the regular season. Still the Sixth Man of the Year punishes the Celtics in drop coverage which will make defensive coverages more difficult to facilitate.

Charlie and Max recently spoke with The Illuminerdi about their experience acting alongside Pattinson in The Batman and they revealed that the Twilight alum had a much different energy and vibe when he was in the batsuit compared to when he was Bruce Wayne.

In the memorable scene that featured both Batman and Bruce Wayne knocking on the door Charlie Carver says that was the first time he saw Pattinson without the batsuit and it was “shocking” because of the actor’s “different take” on the role.

“When we saw him as Bruce Wayne it was the first time we’d seen Pattinson as that half of the character. It was shocking because we’re both big Batman fans here” Charlie explained. “It was just such a different take. I think such an honest take about this wounded traumatized billionaire.”

They watched ‘goofball’ Robert Pattinson transform into a ‘ferocious’ superhero

The first thing that the Carver brothers filmed with Pattinson was “that big action sequence at the drop’s factory warehouse where the Batmobile is revealed.” That was also the first time they saw Pattinson in the batsuit.

However it wasn’t until the scene where “he opens the door or we open the door and you see Batman in front of you” that they truly appreciated Pattinson’s transformation.

“I mean first of all. Rob off camera is just like the sweetest goofiest guy consummate professional but like so warm so lovely to be around” Charlie said. “He was ferocious in that suit. It was one thing to see him kind of play elsewhere but to get punched in the face by Batman over and over again that was a trip.”

The Carver twins know what they would like to see in ‘The Batman’ sequel

Both Charlie and Max say that the contrast between Pattinson’s portrayal of Bruce and Batman “couldn’t have been more different.” Fans may have gotten to enjoy it on screen but seeing it in person was “just really incredible.”

“It was interesting to see the difference…I mean Rob’s like maybe 6’3 just a huge imposing guy… and then you see Bruce show up who’s this kind of wounded almost shrunken reclusive. There’s such a difference between the two and I thought Rob really brought a special interpretation of this character and in that there’s so much room moving forward” Max told ComicBookMovie.com.

He added that in the sequel he would like to see “Bruce develop into maybe the kind of playboy billionaire we all know.” But he really likes where they started the story because of the “surprise” of seeing Bruce Wayne so early on in his vigilante career.

The Batman is now playing on HBO Max and is available on DVD and Blu-Ray.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL2JyaWVmbHkuY28uemEvZmFjdHMtbGlmZWhhY2tzL2NlbGVicml0aWVzLWJpb2dyYXBoaWVzLzEyNzg4NS13aG8tam9lLXJvZ2FuLXdpZmUtamVzc2ljYS1kaXR6ZWxzLWFnZS1jaGlsZHJlbi1wb2RjYXN0LXByb2ZpbGVzLW5ldHdvcnRoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who is Joe Rogan's wife?

One of the biggest reasons for employee dissatisfaction in these positions has to do with pay. While there are plenty of companies upping the hourly rates they offer to employees many workers are still earning under $15 an hour.

There are also tons of examples circulating the web of employees at popular retail chains being subjected to poor treatment from customers who either make their jobs more difficult than they need to be leading to frustration in the workplace and preventing them from performing other necessary tasks.

This could be why so many folks are commiserating with this now viral TikTok video that features a Ross Dress for Less customer filling up shopping carts with allegedly over $3000 of product as the store is nearing closing time—only to have the entire transaction canceled.

Kayla who posts under the TikTok handle @kayla.marx wrote in the video’s caption: “almost 3000$ worth of stuff rung up for a canceled transaction.”

In the first TikTok uploaded about her experience with the customer she shows off two shopping carts filled with shoes. Then there’s a cut to a customer with long pink hair arguing with employees in the store as she holds multiple hangers of clothing. “I’m gonna be done!” the customer shouts saying “don’t tell me no” to the Ross employees.

The video then cuts to more of the customer’s items with a text overlay that reads: “Not the ‘I forgot the wallet'” as people can be heard swearing in the background.

Kayla posted a follow-up video that showcased more of the retail drama. She captioned the video with: “so here we go with the ‘part two / context’ she brought down more shoes was still shopping after store closedAND HER SCREAMING lol AND SISTER POV outside.”

An employee of the store can be heard saying “Ma’am you’re still shopping and we are closed.”

The second video also shows more of the argument between the shopper and exasperated employees who tell that they are closed. They note that they didn’t have to stay open and process the transaction for her which is why they were so frustrated that she continued to keep shopping.

Kayla’s sister was waiting for her in a car and recorded the aftermath of the interaction which shows the customer staring at the store from its front doors as employees lock up.

The pink-haired woman continues to yell at the workers inside the store. “This crazy lady” Kayla’s sister can be heard saying on camera.

The clip ends with the customer still waiting outside of the store.

Commenters on the TikToks expressed that they had been in similar situations before citing experiences such as this one as to why they no longer work in retail.

“I do not miss retail at all” one viewer noted.

“No because I’d have to clock out immediately and meet her outside” another said.

“Retail employees are under[paid] and have to deal with this” a third user argued.

“This happened at my work ALL THE TIME and we were just expected to entertain the crazy people knowing full well they were not going to buy nothing!” one user said.

“So they’re closed closed and she just kept bringing up more and then said she forgot her wallet” another viewer clarified.

There were many who questioned why the woman would be so adamant about filling up her cart with so many items despite having her credit card transaction rejected. Folks in the comments section who said that they worked retail remarked that this is a common tactic used by shoplifters who are attempting to distract employees with large item transactions in an attempt to leave the store with some other items.

“This is a tactic. They do this on purpose so they can steal. Goodwill manager here” one viewer suggested.

“They do that on purpose. They want to run out the door but then get scared” another argued.

“They usually do this to cover up the fact that they are stealing something else and make an excuse to leave” a third viewer agreed.

“I had a lady ring up OVER $3000 in stuff. Took me 45 min to ring up & bag. Then she paid me in Monopoly money then I got written up” one user claimed.

Kayla said in a comment that all of the employees who were working while the customer continued to bring items to the register believed that she was attempting to make a break for it without paying for some products.

The Daily Dot has reached out to Kayla for further comment.

NEW YORK: Major U.S. retailers that recently scrambled to restock shelves amid product shortages disclosed this week that their stores are now packed with too much merchandise and some are even doing what was unthinkable just a few months ago: discounting unsold goods.It's a sign of possible more trouble to come for retailers amid soaring inflation and higher gas prices. With shoppers' tastes quickly shifting many retailers now find themselves with a surplus of merchandise driving up costs. Costco Wholesale Corp said its inventories ballooned 26% in its fiscal third quarter ended May 8 that included a ""few hundred million dollars"" of extra holiday merchandise and being a ""little heavy"" on small appliances and household items.At Gap Inc a 34% spike in inventories was caused by poor sales at Old Navy and longer transit times for goods CFO Katrina O'Connell said Thursday.Similarly Macy 's CEO Jeff Gennette this week cited an ""imbalance"" in inventory . ""Supply chain constraints relaxed"" resulting in it receiving goods from overseas earlier ""than we expected"" he said. Meanwhile shoppers changed buying patterns buying fewer home items while snapping up occasion-based clothing and other merchandise.Average retail inventories in the United States are rising at a faster pace than sales growth according to Citi research on 18 retailers' first-quarter results as of May 22. At 11 of the 18 inventories rose by 10 percentage points more than sales did according to Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. That is the widest gap since before the coronavirus pandemic began illustrating a trend that began in March 2022.During the supply-chain crisis major retailers went on buying sprees loading up on a range of merchandise and bulking up investments in merchandise so they would have enough goods in stock for shoppers flush with cash due to stimulus checks.But the retailers' moves backfired according to executives and analysts. With inflation soaring and fuel prices jumping shoppers retrenched quite rapidly buying less clothing TVs and high-margin appliances.That scenario is prompting retailers like Walmart and Macy's to clear out excess inventories by discounting more items and offering deeper promotions a move that could erode margins. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on its earnings call that it had started ""aggressive"" price rollbacks to boost sales of some higher-margin goods including apparel.To be sure retailers are still battling high costs of sourcing goods and hiring workers which could limit the breadth and depth of promotions they offer The Roosevelt Investment Group's Senior Portfolio Manager Jason Benowitz said.""You will see some discounting and it will be more than last year but ultimately it will be held back by the still high cost of sourcing inventories and labor"" said Benowitz whose firm holds shares in Amazon.com Inc Ross Stores and Autozone Inc.EXCESS MERCHANDISEAs inflation lifted prices of everything from TVs to toothpaste some lower-income consumers have curbed their spending according to Walmart and Target Higher-income shoppers have shown resiliency snapping up suits gowns and footwear and spending more on services economic data and results from retailers that cater to more affluent households showed.Holding excess merchandise proves expensive as warehousing costs rise. Walmart store and distribution centers had 32% more merchandise Target had 43% more goods compared to a year earlier and Best Buy had 9% more merchandise in the first quarter the retailers said. Macy's said on its earning call inventories rose 17% from the same period in 2021.Macy's Chief Financial Officer Adrian Mitchell said on Thursday consumers' quick shift away from ""pandemic categories"" and receiving items sooner than expected due to a loosening supply chain resulted in higher inventories. He forecasted Macy's second-quarter gross margins to reach 2019 levels.Some anticipate that many retailers this year will start to discount more to clear out unsold merchandise. Macy's CFO' warned of ""an elevated promotional environment"" for example.Data from research firm StyleSage showed mid-tier department stores such as Macy's and Kohl's stepped up price promotions in mid-May implementing them on 57% of items.In the clothing category retailers put in place discounts on 36% of items as of mid-May up from 32% in the whole of April according to StyleSage. The average discount however remained steady at 12% since January.Kohl's offered eight promotions in the second week of May versus three in the year-earlier period according to research from Jane Hali & Associates.Similarly Walmart was offering up to 65% off on top-rated items and up to 25% of on tech and home goods during the week of May 9. At the same time last year deals for tech products were just 10% and offers on home products were only on select items.",,,,,,

Cruise companies have been struggling to hire back crew members.

Carnival has temporarily closed two restaurants on all of its ships.

Norwegian and Cunard have capped cruise ship capacities and canceled sailings.

The cruise industry could be in rocky waters again: Difficulties with hiring crew members has hindered several cruise lines' operations leaving some would-be cruise-goers with fewer onboard dining options or canceled trips.

Like on-land hospitality companies cruise lines haven't been immune to worker shortages"" amid the Great Resignation. And now a lack of available cruise workers has begun affecting itineraries and onboard amenities.

This staffing problem is one of the reasons Holland America has decided to ""pace its restart over the year"" a spokesperson told Insider in a statement. While Royal Caribbean's spokesperson acknowledged similar difficulties in hiring up the cruise line doesn't expect it'll be canceling any future itineraries.

Not all cruise companies have been as fortunate as Holland America or Royal Caribbean.

Guests sailing with Carnival will also be spared from itinerary changes. But this doesn't mean it'll be smooth sailing for the cruise line. Carnival will temporarily close two restaurants across all of its ships Fran Golden reported for Bloomberg.

""Our rapid restart has required us to bring back thousands of crew members in a very short time which has increased the number of resources needed for government officials to process the large number of visa applications and slowed down our ability to fully staff some of our functions including our culinary team"" a Carnival spokesperson told Insider in a statement.

Similarly Norwegian Cruise Line's Pride of America which typically operates with over 900 crew members is now accommodating under 550 workers Claudette Covey reported for Travel Pulse. As a result the cruise line has cut the ship's guest capacity as it sails in Hawaii. And some unluckier guests traveling on overbooked ships will have to be rebooked on different itineraries a spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Line told Insider.

Like Norwegian Cunard has limited the number of guests and canceled sailings aboard its Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria ships blaming the ""wider impact of COVID-19"" on its difficulties with hiring. There may not be an immediate relief in sight but a Cunard spokesperson has told Insider that these ""necessary"" cancellations and capacity issues will be ""short term.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMC8wNy8xNy9kb3MtZG9udHMtb2YtbGFiYWRlZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Labadee Haiti Do's and Don'ts (2024),"Labadee Royal Caribbean's original private destination remains a family-favorite place for a great beach day.

Packed with different beaches to choose from thrill attractions and even a few shore excursions you will find lots to enjoy about this private peninsula in Haiti.

It's one of the most popular stops on Royal Caribbean's Caribbean cruises and for good reason - Labadee has something for everyone.

From zip lines to parasailing to luxury cabana retnals there's no shortage of things to do in this tropical paradise.

If you want to make the most of your visit here are some Labadee tips to share from my many visits.

Do prebook a cabana

After I rented my first cabnana at Labadee I have never been able to go back without having one because it was that impressive.

Guests visiting Labadee are able to take rent cabanas at Nellie's Beach or Barefoot Beach (suite guests only).

These cabanas provide privacy shade personalized service and even transportation around Labadee.

For families or groups a cabana rental can make a lot of sense for the convenience it provides along with the great amenities.

If you do want a cabana be sure to prebook it. Cabana rentals go very fast and they almost always sell out months or weeks before a cruise. Your best bet is to log into Royal Caribbean's site and reserve one so that you can ensure your family has it for when you arrive.

Do find the right beach

There are five beaches at Labadee so it is a good idea to figure out which one you want to visit before you step off the ship.

Depending on if you want to be close to the ship want the prettiest water or want the best views there can be a few good choices to consider.

If you are a suite guest your choice is simple: Barefoot Beach. This is a suites-only beach area and the place to go for anyone who has a suite cabin on the ship.

Families usually like to go between Columbus Cove or Adrenaline Beach for the views and open water.

Nellie's Beach is a quieter cove which can get busy as the day goes on but also offers cabanas to rent.

Which beach you pick can depend on a lot of factors especially what time you arrive at the beach. Crowds will build as the day progresses and most guests tend to fill spots closest to the dock first extending out towards Adrenaline Beach and Columbus Cove.

Regardless of which beach you end up going to you should bring some cash with you for tips. Chairs are complimentary but there are locals on Labadee who will help you set them up and it is customary to provide a tip for the assistance.

There is a complimentary ferry at the pier that will take you directly to Columbus Cove to save time.

Don’t forget your Seapass Card

Just like any port you visit you will need your SeaPass card to disembark and for use on the island.

Just like on the ship your SeaPass card is what you will need for most transactions on the island.

You can use it to order drinks and gain access to certain activities. If you end up booking a tour or rent snorkel equipment you will need it for that too.

Make sure you have everyone's card before you leave your stateroom.

Don't forget cash

While Royal Caribbean takes your SeaPass card on Labadee many Haitians work on the island too and they only take cash.

You will need cash for two things: tipping and souvenirs.

You will find helpful locals on Labadee to set up chairs and umbrellas for you and even re-arrange them to suit your needs. While there is no cost for their services a tip is expected.

In addition there is an artisan market you can browse along with crafts available to purchase at different spots. The Haitians working there cannot take your SeaPass card so bring a few dollars with you rather than having to trek back to the ship to get some later.

Don't be afraid to say no in the Artisan market

The Artisan market is an open-air place to buy crafts and other hand made souvenirs.

While the people who sell their wares here are friendly enough they are not passive artisans either. They are salesmen and women so and will try their best to lock in a sale.

There is nothing wrong with browsing but it is okay to say ""no thank you"" if something is not of interest. These storekeepers are proud of the work they have done and will want to sell you something if they can but they will respect if it is clear you are not interested.

Don't forget to take advantage of your drink package

The Royal Caribbean drink package benefits you purchased for your cruise ship work at Labadee as well.

This means if you have the Deluxe Beverage Package you can enjoy unlimited alcoholic beverages along with bottled water sodas and more. Likewise the Royal Refreshment and Soda Package benefits also work on Labadee.

Just give your SeaPass card to any waiter or bartender while ordering and you can enjoy the same sort of drinks as onboard.

Keep in mind that the island's drink selection may be more limited than on the ship but they usually have a good assortment of favorites.

You should also be aware drinks served in souvenir cups and/or fruits (i.e. pineapples) are not included with the drink package although you can get a discount on them.

Don't miss the floating bar

A fun new addition to Labadee is the floating bar on Adrenaline Beach.

You can swim up to the floating bar and climb aboard for a seat anywhere around circular bar.

The floating bar is located underneath the zip line which should provide for some fun views as guests enjoy a beverage at the bar.

And yes your drink package benefits work here as well.

Don't forget your water shoes

I generally do not think water shoes are necessary at beaches in the Caribbean but Labadee's beaches can be tough.

While there is plenty of sand rocks on the ocean floor are not uncommon and it is somewhere where you might consider getting a pair of water shoes.

In addition the paved walkways and even that white sand can get very hot in the afternoon.

Don't be scared of the zip line

The star attraction at Labadee is the Dragon's Breath zip line which is a 2800 foot zip line over the ocean that takes guests across the span of Labadee.

It is not cheap ($95 per guest at last check) but it delivers some really impressive views down one of the longest zip lines over the ocean in the world.

Weather permitting you will have the choice of a traditional zip line ride down or a head first Furious Flyer zipline.

Do go to suites only beach

If you have a Grand Suite or better while on your ship you absolutely want to plan your day around spending time at the suites-only area known as Barefoot Beach.

It is located on the south side of the island and is a relatively smaller beach compared to Adrenaline Beach and is more of a cove in shape.

Crowds on Barefoot Beach are not as prevalent as other areas of Labadee due to its exclusivity.

If you want to reserve a cabana at Barefoot Beach contact your suite concierge. Your best bet is to email your suite concierge in the days before your cruise departs after you receive the welcome email from him/her.

Don't miss the nature trails

It took me quite a few visits before I forced myself to walk down one of the nature trails and it was so worth it!

When you get off the pier there are a few walking trails to your left and it provides nice views around Labadee.

It is probably a good idea to tackle the trails early in the day before the major heat hits in the afternoon.

Staff Writer

May 27 2022 – Weak American gun laws are wreaking havoc on Caribbean islands. No Caribbean country is a major arms exporter or importer or manufacturer yet Magnetic Media’s special series points out gun crimes in the Caribbean have had a startling increase in the last three decades and the International Police (INTERPOL) says 70 percent of all Caribbean murders are carried out with a gun.

The concerning statistics beg the question of where those guns are made and more importantly how they arrive on Caribbean shores.

Most guns in the Caribbean used in crimes start off as perfectly legal weapons.

The world’s largest exporter of guns is the United States of America which accounted for 37 percent of all guns on the international market between 2016 and 2020; only one percent lower than the other top 4 exporters combined.

The country has been steadily producing more than 8.9 million guns per year since 2008 and 2016 marked the highest year with 11.5 million of the weapons made on US soil according to a report by the Centre for American Progress (CAP).

In addition the process to become a gun manufacturer in the US is fairly smooth.

“There are no substantive requirements to qualify as a gun manufacturer: Applicants must only be over age 21 be eligible to possess guns under federal law and not have willfully violated any federal laws or regulations related to firearms” says the CAP.

Gun manufacturing is a growing business 255% more saturated in 2018 than it was in 2009.

The problem is that those legally made guns have begun to sweep into the Caribbean at alarming rates often from the United States. There is no National Gun registry connecting guns to owners in the US in fact Federal law specifically prohibits it which means after initial purchase they can simply…disappear.

And like a sinister magic trick many of them appear in the Caribbean and are used to commit crimes before eventually falling into the hands of the police. Five Caribbean countries are listed among the 25 countries with the highest homicide rate in the region. Four of them are listed in the top five Caribbean destinations for illegal importation of US guns.

In 2020 Jamaica The Bahamas The Dominican Republic Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti requested tracing from the American Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearm and Explosives on a combined 1136 firearms seized by their various police forces.

Seventy percent or 804 guns were from the United States. Of the 804 a whopping 59 percent or 477 could be traced back to a retail purchaser in the United States.

The ease with which guns are purchased in the United States of America make them a common commodity and facilitates the lucrative illegal gun trade out of the country the spoils of which trickle into the Caribbean.

CARICOM insists the United States must take the threat to life in the Caribbean seriously saying “While the Region respects the rights of other states to establish liberal policies regarding access to guns the negative impacts of these gun policies are not confined to their borders. They have very serious consequences for other countries including the Caribbean nations Mexico and the Central American states.”

CARICOM has named Transnational Organised Crime or the Trafficking of Illicit Drugs and Illegal Guns as a tier one crime describing it as an immediate and significant threat to the region.

Without stringent gun laws in the country of origin stemming the flow of illegal guns is left up to the regional authorities in the Caribbean to shoulder and it is proving too heavy to bear."

Craig Zahler’s Gangster Thriller in Cannes (EXCLUSIVE),"Writer-director S. Craig Zahler (“Bone Tomahawk”) is set to reunite with his “Dragged Across Concrete” and “Brawl in Cell Block 99” star Vince Vaughn and Oscar winner Adrien Brody (“The Pianist”) for upcoming crime thriller “The Bookie & the Bruiser.”

Anton will introduce the film to international distributors at the upcoming Marche du Film in Cannes. UTA Independent Film Group and Range Media Partners arranged the financing and will be representing the North American distribution rights.

Set in 1959 New York “The Bookie & the Bruiser” follows a pensive Jewish fellow named Rivner and an oversized Italian-American tough named Boscolo from the Lower East Side both of whom served overseas during WWII and returned changed men who no longer fit inside the lives they’d left behind. Uninterested in taking orders from bosses or playing by the rules of polite society the two friends partner up as a bookmaker and an enforcer and create an illicit gambling operation that proves to be very profitable though risky and their situation gets rather sticky when they find themselves stuck between a powerful Irish gang and the Mafia. The film is currently in pre-production and is planned for a fall 2024 shoot.

Anthony Katagas — an Oscar winner for “12 Years a Slave” and one of the most prolific producers in U.S. indie film having worked across titles including “Lost City of Z” “Ad Astra” “Uncut Gems” and “Armageddon Time” — will produce via his Keep Your Head Productions alongside Dave Caplan. C2 Motion Picture Group is fully financing the project.

“We are thrilled to be working with the visionary S. Craig Zahler on this action-packed tale of a searing conflict between the Irish-American and Italian Mafias in New York and see Vince and Adrien team up in this very unique power charged film” said Anton CEO Sébastien Raybaud.

“I’m honored and humbled to be working with one of my favorite filmmakers” added Caplan. “A S. Craig Zahler gangster movie is something I’m dying to watch.”

Anton’s current film slate includes Claude Barras’ animated feature “Savages” set to world premiere in Cannes’ official selection and “Memoir of a Snail” a stop motion animation from Oscar winning writer-director Adam Elliott (“Mary & Max”) which will make its market debut in Cannes ahead of a world premiere at the Annecy Film Festival. Anton will also debut an exclusive preview of 40 minutes of footage from “Night of the Zoopocalypse” a CGI animated feature from from the studios behind “Despicable Me” “Ice Age: Collision Course” and “Paw Patrol.” Other Anton titles include the heist thriller “Fuze” from the director David Mackenzie starring Aaron Taylor Johnson as well as Martin Campbell’s “Cleaner” starring Daisy Ridley Clive Owen and Taz Skylar.

C2 Motion Picture Group recently co-financed a number of high-profile Paramount films including “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning” “Transformers Rise Of The Beasts” “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” and “Babylon.” C2 also financed and produced the highly anticipated “Longlegs” which Neon is releasing this summer “In The Grey” with Lionsgate and Black Bear “Goodrich” with Ketchup Entertainment “The End We Start From” with Anton and Republic Pictures and “Azrael” with Republic Pictures. C2 is currently in post-production on Stephen King’s “The Monkey| with Range Media Partners and Atomic Monster producing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvbWVkaWEvNDY1MDk4My1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtbGF3cmVuY2Utb2Rvbm5lbGwtbXNuYmMtY291cnRob3VzZS1jb21tZW50cy_SAWhodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL21lZGlhLzQ2NTA5ODMtZG9uYWxkLXRydW1wLWxhd3JlbmNlLW9kb25uZWxsLW1zbmJjLWNvdXJ0aG91c2UtY29tbWVudHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump says MSNBC’s O’Donnell ‘looks like s‑‑‑’,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/media/4650983-donald-trump-lawrence-odonnell-msnbc-courthouse-comments/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvbWVkaWEvNDY1MDk4My1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtbGF3cmVuY2Utb2Rvbm5lbGwtbXNuYmMtY291cnRob3VzZS1jb21tZW50cy_SAWhodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL21lZGlhLzQ2NTA5ODMtZG9uYWxkLXRydW1wLWxhd3JlbmNlLW9kb25uZWxsLW1zbmJjLWNvdXJ0aG91c2UtY29tbWVudHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9kYy1tZC12YS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L2phY2tzb24tcmVlZC1sYXdzdWl0LWlzcmFlbC1wYWxlc3Rpbmlhbi1zZXR0bGVtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,D.C.'s largest high school to show alternate Palestinian film after suit,"The D.C.

Chicago is known as the birthplace of the skyscraper and soon the city will have a new one lining the Chicago River. This tower will belong to software conglomerate Salesforce.

The Chicago Salesforce Tower was announced back in 2018. In addition to its new building Salesforce announced plans to bring 1000 new jobs to the Windy City which will serve as the company’s regional headquarters.

This week Salesforce celebrated the “topping off” of the new building signifying that it is near completion. The company said in a statement that it plans to welcome employees to the new space in 2023.

Standing at 57 stories the new office is located along the Chicago River at 333 W. Wolf Point Plaza and is Salesforce’s eighth global tower. The company’s headquarters remains in San Fransisco.

“We’re excited to start welcoming our employees to Salesforce Tower Chicago in the spring of 2023. We know it will serve as a space where everyone — our employees customers partners Trailblazers and the community — can come together to collaborate innovate learn give back and succeed” the company said in a statement.

In addition to housing the company’s Chicago talent the Salesforce tower will also dedicate space to community and nonprofit events on the ‘Ohana Floors. In other Salesforce towers the ‘Ohana Floors are open to organizations that focus on humanitarian social education or environmental causes to host events and work on a per request basis.

The new building will also feature several environmental initiatives such as carpets made with recycled nylon from recovered fishing nets. The all-electric building won’t use on-site fossil fuels either allowing the energy to be matched by the company’s renewable energy commitment. Currently the building is on track to achieve the LEED v4 Gold and Zero Carbon certifications.

According to a company statement Salesforce has already filled the 1000 local jobs it promised back in 2018. The tech company is still hiring with 55 openings in Chicago ranging from sales and product positions to operations marketing and engineering.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9oaWdoZXN0LXBhaWQtY2Vvcy1pbi1hbWVyaWNhLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The highest paid CEOs in America in 2021,"The world’s richest person also received the highest CEO compensation in 2021.

Elon Musk the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla topped Fortune‘s new list of the most highly compensated CEOs on the Fortune 500. In 2021 Musk “realized” compensation worth almost $23.5 billion from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018 multiyear “moonshot” grant. That was—by far—the biggest CEO payday in 2021 according to our new analysis of how Fortune 500 CEOs are compensated.

After Musk the 10 most highly compensated Fortune 500 CEOs of 2021 are all tech and biotech CEOs including the heads of Apple Netflix and Microsoft. The full list is below.

CEO pay dwarfs that of the average employee. The average big-company CEO made 351 times the pay of the average worker on a realized basis in 2020 according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) which has tracked the metric for decades up from a 21-to-1 ratio back in 1965.

Our analysis evaluated the pay packages of 280 Fortune 500 CEOs who earned a median total compensation of $15.9 million up 30% from a year earlier. When calculating a CEO’s total realized pay we measured the following for the company’s most recent fiscal year: salary and bonuses; other compensation such as vested restricted stock grants long-term incentive payouts and perks; and stock gains in the form of value realized from exercising stock options. Because the value of unexercised options is unpredictable we did not consider them in our tabulation of total compensation.

Here are the highest-paid CEOs.

1. Elon Musk Tesla: $23.5 billion

Musk the founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla “realized” compensation worth almost $23.5 billion in 2021 from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018.

Musk did not respond to Fortune‘s requests for comment.

2. Tim Cook Apple: $770.5 million

Cook has been CEO of Apple Inc. since 2011. He earned $770.5 million in 2021 alone mostly as a part of a 10-year grant of shares worth $1.7 billion. But his incredible pay package may be justified by Apple’s stock market performance under Cook: The tech company’s market value during his tenure has increased by $2.2 trillion.

Apple ranks 3 on the Fortune 500. The company faced challenges because of the global chip shortage but successfully began manufacturing the equipment in-house. Apple finished the year with a gargantuan $95 billion in profits—outperforming every other U.S. company on that front.

Apple declined to comment on Fortune‘s analysis.

3. Jensen Huang NVIDIA $561 million

A spokesperson acknowledged that during the latest fiscal year Huang “realized about $507 million from expiring options that had been granted in 2011 and 2012 reflecting the approximately 60x increase in the company’s share price over the [past] decade.”

4. Reed Hastings Netflix: $453.5 million

Netflix ranked 115 on the Fortune 500 with an 18.8% change in revenue. The company has recently cut costs after losing subscribers as the world re-opens after the pandemic. Netflix also faces increased competition from streaming services.

A spokesperson disputed Fortune‘s analysis of Hastings’ realized pay and would only reiterate the total value of his “granted” compensation for 2021: “Per our proxy statement his compensation in 2021 was $40.8 million with $650000 in cash and $39.7 million in stock options.”

5. Leonard Schleifer Regeneron Pharmaceuticals: $452.9 million

The company ranked 231 on this year’s Fortune 500. Revenue rose 89.1% in 2021 driven by the company’s REGEN-COV antibody treatment for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

A spokesperson noted that the bulk of Schleifer’s realized pay per Fortune‘s analysis “reflects the exercise of long-held options that were reaching their ten-year expiration point” and said “Regeneron’s compensation philosophy has always emphasized long-term incentives in the form of stock options and other equity-based awards as we believe this aligns employee interests with the typically long-term nature of drug development.”

6. Marc Benioff Salesforce: $439.4 million

Benioff founded Salesforce in 1999 adopting the marketing slogan “The End of Software.” The cloud-based customer relationship management platform ranked 136 on this year’s Fortune 500.

Salesforce did not respond to a request for comment.

7. Satya Nadella Microsoft: $309.4 million

Many of Nadella’s peers likely believe he deserves a huge payday. This year Nadella was voted the “most underrated” CEO for the sixth consecutive year according to the survey behind Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies. Nadella has headed that list since 2017.

Microsoft posted a robust 38% increase in profits last year—earning $61 billion the fourth-largest sum among Fortune 500 companies—as revenue rose 17.5% to $168 billion thanks to a successful Surface laptop and tablet launch. The company which ranked 14 on this year’s 500 also grappled with a chip shortage that challenged Xbox game consoles.

Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.

Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick earned $296.7 million last year according to our calculations from the value realized on vested restricted stock. Despite rampant employee complaints and several lawsuits over sexism harassment and Kotick’s personal mismanagement of assault claims at the game developer Microsoft in January agreed to buy Activision for $68.7 billion in what would be its largest acquisition to date.

In an emailed statement a spokesperson reiterated that Activision Blizzard had valued Kotick’s “granted” (but not realized) compensation in 2021 at $826549. She noted that Kotick had reduced his salary to $62500 last year and praised his 31-year tenure for making Activision “one of the most successful global gaming com- panies in the world.”

Note: This article was first published on 23 May 2022.

It’s been a really long time (2.5 years to be precise) since Singapore has a proper offline IT fair and the organiser for the first-ever 2022 one is the most unlikely of the bunch.

Lazada is running a week-long Grand Online Tech Show at the atrium in Plaza Singapura from 23 May to 29 May 2022 with 24 partnered brands on site. That doesn’t yet include the online-only retailers taking part in Lazada’s gadgetry festival.

Visitors can expect to find brands like Vivo Logitech Lenovo Garmin Razer Sony Prism+ Microsoft ASUS Huawei Braun Jabra Seagate and many more at the fair. What’s also amazing is the number of new and upcoming products seen at the stalls.

For example we spotted the Sony WH-1000XM5 right next to its predecessor giving visitors an opportunity to make comparisons between both models at the show grounds.

I am completely devastated and heartbroken. Lori and I were friends and worked together for over 27 years at PPG Valspar and Sherwin-Williams. I never met her family in person but I feel like I knew all of them from our work conversations that always turned into family conversations. She was so very proud of them. I don't know how to process all of this and I am so sorry for all of those who are missing them. - Brett BiaLowas  Charlotte  North Carolina

You can rest assured Katie that your beloved parents and brothers will soon awaken from “sleep” ; just as Lazarus was brought back to life after 4 days in the grave. Our hearts are broken  just as Jesus grieved ; altho’ knowing he was about to resurrect Lazarus. Psalms 34:18 Holy spirit will strengthen us to have more faith in the promise of the resurrection. John 5:2829 Christopher Lori Zachary and Nathan will be delighted to see you Katie in paradise. Jesus promised “You will be with me in paradise” Luke 23:43 With eternity in our heart we grieve to see sacred life interrupted. They live in our hearts and memories soon to return in perfect health.

Praying for Strength for Katie and her family - Fransioli  Richmond hill  Ga

Look up to the Lord for strength. Hold on to God’s unchanging hands. Lean on the everlasting arms of our Lord and Savior. Cast all your anxieties on the Lord. Focus on the eternal life of your parents and siblings. That’s what we all need to do. I pray that God will hold you up at this time of bereavement. Love the Snipes Family (Angela Wardell and Tyler.) - Snipes  Savannah  Georgia

There are no words at a time like this—only raw emotions of shock disbelief anger and overwhelming grief. We question “why”. Why God? Why do the very best among us have their lives taken in such a senseless tragedy? Why are families shattered for seemingly no reason at all? Why must those left behind have to endure such heartbreak and pain? To cope all we can do now is share our tears hugs prayers support and memories. Yet we’ll still be left with the question of “why”? For Katie and Robin especially and the entire family trees of Leffler’s Seaman’s and Harrison’s the strength we need will be found through each other. Godspeed and may God bless us all. - Dale & Joan Terry  Little Rock  Arkansas

I only had the opportunity to work with Lori for about 3 years at Valspar and Sherwin Williams - but during that short period of time I admired her intelligence commitment but most of all her empathy towards co-workers and employees. She had such a gift of making you feel relaxed and enthused at the same time. A genuinely kind thoughtful person whom I greatly admired. I did not get the opportunity to meet her family but based on my time with her I know they were amazing people as well. I am truly sorry this tragic event occurred and don't know how to express my thoughts. My prayers for strength and healing go out to Katie family and friends. - Barry McLaughlin  Charlotte  NC

Prayers and thoughts for all the family. - Candy Jakab  Port St Lucie  FL

Lori from the first moment I held you you were a pleasure to be with. You made me an aunt for the very first time and I will always treasure that. Through the too few years you were with us you gave nothing but love and kindness and grace. And when you happily introduced us to Chris we knew he was the perfect life partner for you. Zack and Nate were so like you and Chris loving thoughtful and always ready to assist in anyway they could. Katie stays to show the world what a legacy of great parenting can continue to do. Wherever you are how very very proud you must be of all three of them. Your passing is still surreal but the memories we have left could not be better because you all have made our world better. - Susan & Jim Connell  Greenville  South Carolina

Our thoughts and prayers are with you during this very difficult time - Carl and Petrina Remley  Alton  New Hampshire

Chris was one of a kind. My heart breaks for this family. I will continue to pray for everyone involved and healing upon all broken hearts. - Jill Dilbeck  Canton  GA

We are heartbroken over the loss of Chris Lori Zack and Nate. Our two oldest children had the privilege of being taught by Chris at King’s Ridge Christian School. Chris was a special teacher. He really wanted to know the kids and develop relationships with them. He was a Christian leader teacher advisor and football coach for my son. My son Yale was fortunate to attend two Europe trips under Chris’ leadership and they shared a love of history. Yale also knew Nate from football school and traveling and enjoyed him so much as a friend. I also got to know Lori in the stands at football games cheering on our boys. Chris had an impact on every student and that is such a rare special quality. My kids will always remember how he strived to create “pockets of heaven” as he called them. Our prayers are with Katie and all their family and friends. I love this verse Chris quoted under a picture he posted with Yale and friends in Germany “May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. Romans 15:13 - Jacobi family (Jim Allyson Yale Anna Claire Drake and Jett)  Milton  GA

My sister Amy Noll has known Becky (Leffler) since elementary school thus me knowing Becky & Julian as well. I saw Becky this past fall celebrating Amy's birthday as she is still such a dear friend to my sister. Sending love prayers and peace to your entire family❤️ - Christi (Noll) Ciampaglione & Family  Midland  Va

Such a beautiful family. Katie- may you find peace and guidance through this time. - Nikki wainwright  Wilmington  Delaware

Saying I am so very sorry doesn't seem adequate . Even though I have actually never met the family though Lori was and upper classmen when we were at St. Elizabeth's I did graduate with Robin in 1992. I can say she was always kind to me (kind to all) and so I know she had to come from a loving family. I pray God shine His presence upon you all and provide some solace at this unthinkable time. - Christine Hershey (Sansone)  Manheim  PA

Words cannot convey the sadness. I worked with Lori for only a few years. I admired her intelligence positivity and kindness. There is no doubt that her family was the core of her being. She frequently shared highlights of her family’s latest activities and achievements. I felt as though I personally knew each family member. My thoughts and prayers go out to the family. - Joe Higdon  Charlotte  NC

I'm so shocked and saddened to learn about this devastating loss. I worked with Lori at Valspar/Sherwin & she spoke of Katie and her boys with such pride & love.

May God's peace which passes all understanding find & fill grieving hearts and hold you all in the palm of His hand. - Gina Thompson  Charlotte  NC

I worked with your Dad when your family lived in Ohio and lived in Thornapple. - Ramona Schleppi  Grove City  Ohio

I am saddened by the loss of this wonderful family. I taught with Chris at King’s Ridge and always respected his desire and passion to help others in the classroom and in athletics. I will miss our conversations about toughness the economy politics and even the Pittsburgh Steelers. Nate was a student of mine at King’s Ridge and also played basketball his freshman year. Nate was always wanting to get better. His calm and caring demeanor was his personality. Nate was a great friend to his peers and was really starting to develop his true personality with his quick whit and ability to genuinely care for others. I know that Chris Nate Lori and Zach are in heaven. You all will be missed but know that you have had a lasting impact on my life that will never be forgotten. Bob Martin & Family - Bob Martin  Cumming  GA

May God wrap His loving arms around you Katie & bring comfort that surpasses all understanding. May the Lord bless you & keep you - May His face shine upon you be gracious to you and give you peace. Numbers 6:24-26 - Rena’ Wall / Reggie Davis  Greensboro  NC

A candle has been lit! A candle has been lit! I can’t put into works the sadness I feel for the family. God will guide you through the very tough time. Don’t stop believing because it is very easy to keep asking why why God. I meet Chris in Greensboro NC. He coached with the Gaters AAU boys basketball club. I was the president of the club and Chris later joined our board. I coached Zack when he was very young. I later meat the whole family. They were a very special family and enjoyed life everyday. - William Britt  Greensboro  NC

Dear Linda John Katie and families I am heartbroken for all of you and pray that God’s grace will be with all of you in the weeks months and years ahead. With profound sympathy Terri - Terri Denk  JOHNSTOWN  PA

Our hearts were broken when we heard the tragic news trying to make sense of this. We only have the fondest memories of spending time together as families in the basketball gym and at the park for baseball and football. Our thoughts and prayers are with Katie and the extended family. - Ben Jackie Wesley and Sarah Barham  Summerfield  NC

We first met the Lefflers in Hilliard OH many years ago when our oldest sons played tee-ball and coach pitch baseball together. Chris and I coached together on the coach pitch team instantly bonded and remained great friends until the end. Chris Lori and their children were the best people on planet earth! PERIOD. Chris and Lori were devout Christians loving parents and great friends of our family. Although we did not see them as often as we would have liked due to their frequent moves to accommodate Lori’s numerous work promotions we never lost touch; exchanging Christmas cards every year texting/calling on occasion and following each other on social media. No matter the distance between us Chris and I remained very close and communicated with each other regularly; largely because we shared very similar interests and had a so much in common. In particular Chris and I shared a love for our great country and loved talking politics and history whenever possible. We also shared a passion for the same sports teams; particularly Ohio State Football and the Pittsburgh Steelers. I will most surely miss being a part of Chris’ group texts whenever Ohio State or the Steelers had a big important game! Chris was probably one of the most intelligent most well-read logical-thinking people I have ever known. Whenever I would need clarification on something that was weighing on my mind - no matter what the topic - Chris was often the first and only person I would call. And while we did not agree on every single topic we discussed I probably valued Chris’ opinions on matters of politics/history and sports more than anyone else in this world because I knew no matter what the topic once it had taken a trip through his vast logical brain there was nothing left to ponder. When I first met Chris he worked in the financial world but I was thrilled when I learned a few years later that he had become a teacher because that was the job he was born to do. I’m hoping that his former students appreciate what a passionate committed well-prepared teacher they had in “Mr. Leffler” because they could not have asked for anyone better. Most importantly Chris loved the Lord and cherished his wife and children like no one else I’ve ever known. He was a dedicated loving husband and father not to mention a great friend to all of us who had the pleasure of knowing the man. I often looked at Chris with a certain amount of awe and respect and was admittedly envious of the man for seemingly having it all and having his act together like no one I have ever known. And now he’s gone… I simply can’t believe it. I still have not been able to process this tragedy in my mind and I may never be able to for as long as I live. They say “the Lord works in mysterious ways” and after a tragedy like this I’d say it’s more like a mystery inside of a riddle wrapped up in an enigma. All I can do right now is cling to my faith that better days lay ahead and that we will all meet again in heaven someday. Katie I pray that you will be able to remain strong and will be able to come to grips with this someday. And know this: your family surely would not want you to grieve over them forever or to give up on your dreams. Your life is a gift from God and you were spared for a reason. As I said to you on the phone the other day PLEASE keep your faith and if there’s ever anything we can do to help you deal with this whether it be a shoulder to lean on a sympathetic ear or even a place to live DO NOT HESITATE to reach out! I’m hoping you will finish your degree at Purdue and will come see us in Columbus as often as possible and for as long as you want. You will always be welcome here! Looking after you is the least we can do for your wonderful parents! R.I.P. to Chris Lori Zack and Nate. Gone but NEVER forgotten… - Goins Family  Columbus  Ohio

I am beyond heartbroken and struggling to express my condolences. I worked for Lori at Valspar and then Sherwin Williams. I always referred to her as the calm in the storm.

Katie my prayer for you is that you have your mother's strength and preserverance and that God along with all those that love you are your calm in this immeasurable storm. - Sandy Daniel  Covington  Georgia

It’s still so shocking to see that my next door neighbors of a little over 8 years taken from this world so suddenly and tragically. My love to Katie who I was fast friends with and close to for so many years. It feels sad looking at the home they had just moved from recently and remembering all the times I spent there with the family. This time last year I was taking care of sweet Percy their dog while they took one of their many family trips. I will cherish the memories over the few family dinners I was so honored to experience over at the Leffler’s house. I send my strongest love and care to Katie as she continues to walk this crazy thing called life. - Barrett Taylor  Milton  Georgia

As I am sure… like most everyone who knows the family I am still completely devastated. This was such an unimaginable and tragic event that just leaves you with unanswered questions - I had the pleasure to work with Lori at Valspar/Sherwin Williams in Covington GA. From day one she was a true leader intelligent kind accessible- I could go on and on… Above all you quickly learned how very proud she was of her children. She literally glowed with pride & love when she talked of them which was often. No one could have foreseen nor will anyone be able to explain why this horrible tragedy happened to such a wonderful family but Katie please know there are so many who loved your family whose thoughts and prayers are with you now hoping you will never be truly alone as you navigate this new reality. A reality I know your Mom never would have wanted you to have to endure alone.

Sally Bob Caroline Robin and Katie I am so very sorry for the tragic loss of Lori Chris Zack and Nate. My prayers are with you. I met Lori in 6th grade and we became fast friends. She was intelligent kind and compassionate - a true confidant and friend. She loved her family and I knew even when we were young that one day she would be an amazing mother - that being a mother was truly part of her life’s purpose. We spent many weekends at my grandparents’ beach house in Dewey - beaching it during the day and going to the boardwalk (and years later bars at night.) She always loved the beach and was always willing to pitch in - push a stroller or help with dishes. She was like part of the family. I remember going with her to her Mom-Mom Rose’s in Cleland Heights after school and sleepovers at the Burgess house eating chips and dip and watching movies. We went to our first concert together - Kenny Loggins. We had fun at school dances and ski trips. We saw each other through boyfriends and breakups. We shared so many memories together throughout high school and college and we’re in each other’s weddings. We even got to go through pregnancy together allbeit long distance (I was pregnant with my oldest when she was pregnant with her youngest - they were born a week apart.) It is a rare thing in this world to have that person that knows you inside and out - all of your history and that you can tell anything to and know that you will be loved and supported - Lori was surely that for me. I love you Lori - your light will be missed. My sincerest condolences to Lori and Chris’s entire family. - Kelly Petruccelli  Wilmington  DE

Deepest sympathy and prayers for Katie and family at this sad time - CAROLYN Louise EMERICK  Savannah  Ga

I am so deeply sorry for this sudden terrible painful heartbreaking loss.

We are holding you in our thoughts. - Rebekah Klein-Pejsova  West Lafayette  IN

Lori was instrumental in my career in Powder Coatings from PPG to Valspar and Sherwin Williams. She always spoke highly of her family and very proud of Nate Zack and Katie. She will be deeply missed but not forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with Katie and family. - Alicia Williams  Charlotte  NC

Like many others words fail when it comes to a tragedy such as this. I did not know the family but was a high school friend of Lori's mom and dad. My thoughts and prayers are with you. - Alan D Low  Milton  FL

My heart is broken for each of you who are faced with immeasurable loss. Lori was a dead friend of mine since met while working at PPG/GGC/Axiall/Westlake. Though only 10 years older she has been my “mommy mentor” who for the last decade has helped me navigate two pregnancies and a professional career… something she also did for several other friends. Lori was always ready with encouragement a sympathetic ear and helpful advice. She treasured her family above all and was so proud of all Chris Zach Nate and Katie accomplished but most of all the people they were and are. She managed to balance the demands of motherhood and a successful demanding career. While we talked at least once a month and had dinner regularly it was never enough—we always left each other with more to say and a conversation-in-progress. Time with Lori left me feeling lighter and happier and more whole. (We joked that our husbands said we needed to see each other every week)! When she had to cancel our May dinner for travel I never once thought we’d not have the chance for another. I loved Lori and will remember her optimism positivity ability to see to the heart of an issue and navigate challenges. But more than anything else I’ll remember how much she cherished her family and devoted her life to them. I’m grateful for the time we had together and here (in Atlanta) for anything at all that is needed. - Meagan Potts Weinzierl  Decatur  GA

Still in disbelief and heartbroken over the loss of Chris his wife Lori and sons Zackary and Nathan. I went to high school with Chris and remember him as a fantastic athlete with a huge heart very driven to do his very best at any task.

We pray God watch over his daughter Katie and the families during these difficult times. Memory Eternal. John and Kathy Cislo - John Cislo  Johnstown  Pennsylvania

It has taken be a while to post for I am still trying to process the tragedy. I had the pleasure to work with Lori at Valspar/Sherwin-Williams.

She will be missed but I know a part of her still lives on earth through her daughter. There is a group of new angels in heaven I hope they love their new wings. - Lisa Jacobson  Minneapolis  MN

As it turned out there were no shots fired and the mall was not locked down said Lt. Paul Camarinha of the Elizabeth Police Department. Camarinha said the incident was under investigation and few details were available.

”What we’re getting is that this was some sort of a prank” Camarinha said. “We’re still collecting information.”

Someone made the false report five days after an 18-year-old gunman shot and killed 19 children and two teachers at a school in Texas 10 days after another teenaged gunman fatally shot 10 people at a supermarket in Buffalo.

Earlier Sunday morning at the Barclay’s Center arena in Brooklyn following a Saturday night of boxing a loud thud sent attendees rushing for the exits a crush that injured 17 people ABC 7 reported.

The false report of the mall shooting came in at about 1 p.m. Camarinha said adding it was still unclear whether someone had called 911 reported it to mall security or a merchant or some other way.

With 230 stores most of them retail clothing outlets the bi-level 1.3-million-square-foot Jersey Gardens is one of the state’s largest shopping malls. Jersey Gardens is owned by Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group. Spokespeople for Simon did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday.

Carmichael and her staff called the families they serve to let them know about the recall and to tell them to double check their jars.

As of May 26 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported16 salmonella illnesses in 12 states. Of those 16 people two were hospitalized. So far no cases have been reported in Indiana but one patient has been reported in both Ohio and Illinois.

The Mayo Clinic says common symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea fever and stomach (abdominal) cramps within 8 to 72 hours after exposure.

The salmonella outbreak is linked to certain Jif peanut butter products produced at the J.M. Smucker Company facility in Lexington Kentucky according to the FDA. Last week ABC affiliate WTVQ reached out to the Jif plant in Lexington and were told ""no comment.""

WTVQ/ABC News Lexington The FDA says the J.M. Smucker Company facility located in Lexington KY is the ""likely cause of illnesses"" in a salmonella outbreak affecting Jif peanut butter.

The recall is also affecting other foods including snack trays fudge and chocolate that were made with or repackaged with Jif peanut butter. For a full list of affected products click here.

Additionally GetGo Cafe + Market announced a recall on GetGo branded Apples with Peanut Butter Dip sold in Indiana Pennsylvania Ohio and West Virginia. The company says the peanut butter included with the apples was affected by the Jif recall and the item was sold in around 200 transactions.

The impacted product was sold in GetGo locations through May 13 2022 and can be identified by the UPC 30034 93770 6 and includes best if used by dates through May 29 2022.

GetGo says so far no illnesses linked to the product have been reported.

From savory snacks to deliciously-sweet desserts Guests will surely be able to find whatever they please at the four Disney World Parks or Disney Springs.

However an issue has been affecting the Walt Disney World Resort lately.

You most likely have heard of the peanut butter recall happening across the nation right now. According to the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) “The FDA along with CDC and state and local partners are investigating a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Senftenberg infections linked to certain Jif peanut butter products produced at the J.M. Smucker Company facility in Lexington Kentucky.”

This recall has put a halt on most peanut butter products not just at Disney but for most of the country and recently one Disney eatery was forced to remove one of its most popular items.

At Disney’s Beach Club Resort Guests can indulge their sweet tooth at Beaches & Cream Soda Shop with ice cream and some wildly-decadent creations. Unfortunately one delicious item is no longer served on the menu due to the peanut butter recall.

The No Way Jose sundae which is a “Peanut Butter and Hot Fudge delight featuring Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream Peanut Butter and Chocolate Morsels Whipped Cream and a Cherry” was removed from the menu. Disney Guest Sharla M. confirmed this yesterday after attempting to order one.

This has also affected Gideon’s Bakehouse in Disney Springs with the official Facebook account for the bakery sharing the following statement:

I’m in a bit of a pickle. All of our wonderful limited flavors this month are Peanut Butter based and due to the recall all bulk stock of PB coming into the state has been slowed down. We need hundreds of pounds a day and have zero. So officially there are no PB-based Desserts in the shop aka Peanut Butter Crunch Peanut Butter Chocolate Swirl and the fantastic PB&J Cake Slices. This issue won’t likely resolve until next week and it will take us a couple of days to ramp back up production since as you know everything we do is made from scratch by hand and takes over 24 hours to prepare. If my tears could turn into Peanut Butter you would all have a lifetime supply. To compensate we’ll be adding Coffee Cake and Dark Coffee Cake in greater numbers to BOTH stores starting Wednesday available at open until sell out. That Cookie is limited because it takes so long to make so we might not be able to maintain it for long. Keep an eye on feed and stories for flavor replacement updates going into the weekend. To replace the PB&J Cake Slice until this blows over … drum roll … the Original Red Velvet Cake Slices return! Cream Cheese is back!!⁣

The 2022 Monaco GP has ended in favor of Red Bull with Sergio Perez winning the race and teammate Max Verstappen finishing third. However the race was chaotic from a delayed start because of the rain to the red flag which was caused by Mick Schumacher.

The young Haas driver lost control of his car at Piscine and crashed into the wall. The result of the crash left Schumacher’s VF-22 in two pieces and even destroyed the barrier. So the FIA had to pause the race to fix the barrier and remove the broken Haas as well as the debris from the track.

Why do F1 cars break into two halves after a crash?

This was the second major crash for Mick after the Saudi Arabian GP. In both the accidents his car broke into two. This scenario has raised questions among many fans that why the F1 cars are so fragile.

However there is a reason for the car breaking down in such a manner. Four mounting points hold the gearbox to the rear of the V-6 block. These points absorb the impact and break the car in halves to minimize the damage to a driver.

The FIA ordered the teams to develop the cars in such a manner for the 2022 season. The enhanced safety protocols came into play after the former Haas driver Romain Grosjean’s crash in Bahrain. The 2020 Bahrain GP accident involving the Swiss-French driver is still fresh in everyone’s minds and to avoid another such case FIA is taking these steps.

It was a massive accident for the young German. But thanks to the safety features of the present F1 challengers Mick was unhurt. However after a crash he had to get checked by the medical team as part of the mandatory process.

The 23-year-old is unharmed but he’s not happy with the incident. Later on Mick said “The pace felt strong and it felt like we were able to attack and push. Unfortunately I went a bit too wide probably about 10 centimeters at the end and that’s enough to lose all grip that you thought you had and the result is what happened”

The Circus singer and her social media team appeared to heed the responses and quickly put up a video of Britney modeling a red and black body suit with black ankle boots dancing with her cat.

Negative response: The nude photo post received a lot of negative responses from fans so the Gimme More singer quickly uploaded a video of her dancing with her cat

At a Glance Hotter than average temperatures are possible from the Southern Plains into much of the East.

The Northwest is forecast to see more below average temperatures.

The weather pattern in June could fluctuate more than usual. Temperatures are predicted to be hotter than average from the Southern Plains into the East as summer kicks off in June. Meanwhile the Northwest could continue the below-average temperature pattern it's seen much of spring

An area from the mid-Mississippi and Ohio valleys into the mid-Atlantic is forecast to have temperatures that are the most above average in June according to an updated outlook from The Weather Company an IBM Business and Atmospheric G2. Above average temperatures are also forecast for a broad area from the Southern Plains to New England.

Much of Washington and northwest Oregon has the greatest likelihood of a cooler than average first month of summer. That comes on the heels of the Northwest region's ninth coolest April and generally below-average temperatures in May so far.

Keep in mind this outlook is an overall trend for the month. That means there will be periods that are hotter or cooler in each respective region of the country when compared to what is shown above.

That's particularly the case in June since the weather pattern could fluctuate more than usual due to the influence of activity in the tropics.

""We feel that there will likely be more weekly variability than usual in June"" said Dr. Todd Crawford director of meteorology at Atmospheric G2.

Advertisement One such example of this variability could occur in the first few days of the month.

Much of the East is predicted to have above-average temperatures on the first full day of the month with any below average temperatures confined to the Plains. That cooler air could then spread to the East and bring relief from the early-season heat for at least a few days early in the month.

However the forecast suggests the negative phase of the Pacific-North American Oscillation or negative PNA should dominate the rest of the month.

Temperatures are generally favored to be above average in the East and below average in the Northwest much like the June outlook shows when the PNA is in its negative phase.

The Associated Press

SAN DIEGO — A California woman who punched a Southwest Airlines flight attendant in the face during a flight breaking her teeth has been sentenced to 15 months in federal prison.

Vyvianna Quinonez was also ordered Tuesday by the federal judge in San Diego to pay nearly $26000 in restitution and a $7500 fine for the assault on a May 23 2021 Southwest flight between Sacramento and San Diego.

The 29-year-old Sacramento woman is prohibited from flying for three years while she is on supervised release and must participate in anger management classes or counseling.

Quinonez last year pleaded guilty to one count of interference with flight crew members and attendants admitting she punched the flight attendant in the face and head with a closed fist and grabbed her hair. Neither she nor her attorney could be reached for comment Tuesday.

During the flight’s final descent the attendant had asked Quinonez to buckle her seat belt stow her tray table and put on her facemask properly.

Instead Quinonez began recording the attendant on her cellphone pushed her then stood up and punched the woman in the face and grabbed her hair before other passengers intervened authorities said.

The assault was recorded on another passenger’s cellphone.

The plea agreement said that the flight attendant suffered three chipped teeth two of which needed crowns along with bruises and a cut under her left eye that needed stitches.

“Attacks on flight crew members who perform vital jobs to ensure passenger safety will not be tolerated"" U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman said in a statement after the sentencing.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy said the sentence should “send a very strong message to air travelers – the FBI will vigorously pursue anyone who assaults or interferes with flight crews.”

The incident was part of an escalation in unruly behavior by airline passengers amid the coronavirus pandemic and led the president of the flight attendants’ union to ask for more federal air marshals on planes.

A California woman who punched a Southwest Airlines flight attendant mid-flight and broke her teeth has been sentenced to 15 months in prison.

The Sacramento woman Vyvianna Quinonez 29 was also ordered to pay $26000 (£20587) in restitution and will also be required to serve three years of parole after her release from federal prison according to a release from the US Attorney’s Office in San Diego.

The 29-year-old whose violent assault on the flight attendant was captured in a viral video that was circulated widely following the May 2021 incident had pleaded guilty in December to a charge of interfering with a Southwest Airlines flight attendant.

Initially Quinonez had been charged in federal court with one count of assault resulting in serious bodily injury both considered felonies but she was later able to reach a plea bargain with prosecutors that resulted in her current conviction.

The motivation for the 29-year-old passenger’s unprecedented attack reportedly stemmed from an argument between Ms Quinonez and the flight attendant who had repeatedly asked the woman to follow standard inflight instructions including putting her tray up buckling her seat belt and putting her face mask on properly.

Ms Quinonez initially filmed the altercation with the flight attendant who was unnamed in the court documents and then a separate video surfaced which caught the subsequent attack on the Southwest Airlines employee.

In the 23 May 2021 video Ms Quinonez can be seen getting up from her aisle seat and crossing over to throw several punches at the flight attendant most of which land square in her face.

Passengers onboard the flight could be seen in the video trying to disarm the angry passenger but she still managed to pull the hair of the employee and cause her serious injury.

Court documents from the prosecution later revealed that the airline worker was taken to hospital after the flight and required two of her teeth to be replaced by crowns while three of her teeth were chipped and needed to be repaired by surgery. She was also left with swelling on her face and bruising and a cut under her left eye.

Ms Quinonez was also ordered to pay a $7500 fine.

Part of the presiding judge’s impetus for handing down the 18-month sentence to the 29-year-old an assistant for the US attorney told The New York Times was a strong consideration for “general deterrence”.

“He explained that the victims included not just the flight attendant victim and Southwest Airlines but all passengers on the plane that day and flight attendants working in the industry” said Jacklyn Stahl in an email to The Times.

General deterrence was also an angle earmarked by Southwest Airlines. In a letter to the sentencing judge a Southwest executive laid out why they believed that given the high-profile nature of the assault which they characterised as “sickening” it should be met with serious consequences.

“This specific passenger created a situation onboard Flight 700 that jeopardised the entire flight and created an unsafe environment” the executive wrote. “Given the widespread news coverage of this incident Southwest hopes that the ultimate sentence imposed in this matter will serve as a deterrent for others who may contemplate engaging in similar dangerous behaviour.”

The defendant for her part attempted to sway the judge into delivering a lighter sentence by penning a handwritten letter from her jail cell which highlighted the “challenges” she’d faced since the footage of her attack went viral and how she took “full responsibility for [her] actions”.

“My mistakes were broadcasted nationwide news and I have been completely disappointed and ashamed of myself” she wrote in a letter included in court documents.

The May 2021 attack on the Southwest Airlines flight from Sacramento International Airport came at a time when airline employees were increasingly facing attacks from unruly and at times violent passengers.

The addition of Covid-19 travel restrictions seemed to only pour gasoline on an already omnipresent threat of unruly passengers.

According to data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) incidents have been steadily rising since 2012 with the agency attributing most to be caused by intoxication and non-compliance with safety regulations.

Nationally a similar trend has been playing out but has noticeably intensified since post-pandemic travel began taking off. According to national records maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration in 2019 the agency docked 146 investigations into unruly passengers while in 2021 that skyrocketed to 1099.

For the 2022 year it appears to be on track for keeping up with the previous year’s record as approaching the halfway mark of the calendar year that agency has initiated 470 investigations into unruly or dangerous passenger behaviour.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzI4L3Z5dmlhbm5hLXF1aW5vbmV6LXRvLXNlcnZlLTE1LW1vbnRocy1pbi1wcmlzb24tZm9yLWFzc2F1bHRpbmctc291dGh3ZXN0LWZsaWdodC1hdHRlbmRhbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vyvianna Quinonez to serve 15 months in prison for assaulting Southwest flight attendant,"The unruly Southwest Airlines passenger who attacked a flight attendant and knocked out two of her teeth last year was sentenced to 15 months in prison.

Vyvianna Quinonez 29 was also ordered by a federal judge on Tuesday to pay some $33000 in restitution and fines and was banned from flying for three years upon her release from a federal lockup.

The California woman had pleaded guilty to interfering with a flight crew last year.

On May 23 2021 Quinonez was asked to buckle her seat belt stow her tray table and put on her facemask properly as a Southwest flight from Sacramento approached San Diego.

Instead of complying the woman began recording the flight attendant on her phone before pushing and punching her and grabbing her hair. The attack was recorded by another passenger.

From about 1973 on after I took George Hilton’s class in transportation economics I became an evangelist for deregulation of airlines. I used to have a bumper sticker on my briefcase that said:

Deregulate Air Transportation: Ground the CAB.

CAB of course stands for Civil Aeronautics Board.

When I argued for deregulation Exhibit A was Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) in California and Exhibit B was Southwest Airlines in Texas. Both showed how competition would work to make fares lower for passengers.

When I was a summer intern in 1973 at the Council of Economic Advisers under Herb Stein Herb made me an acting senior economist for the month or so between when Bob Tollison left and his replacement Alan Pulsipher arrived. I was attending meetings on airline deregulation with the Undersecretary of Transportation. Herb suggested after I reported on one of these meetings that we drop the issue because it seemed hopeless and our limited resources would be better used elsewhere. I argued that we should keep it up because it was using only a few hours of my week each week. I actually persuaded him. I still feel proud of that.

For more on airline deregulation see Alfred E. Kahn “Airline Deregulation” in David R. Henderson ed. The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics 1st edition and Fred L. Smith Jr. and Braden Cox “Airline Deregulation” in David R. Henderson ed. The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics 2nd edition.

Note: The link to Tollison has incorrect information. He was a senior economist from 1972 to 1973 not from 1971 to 1972."

That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics."

Managers began denying employees promotions and transfers several weeks ago after 22 of 28 “partners” at the Millwood Avenue store petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for union representation. The workers reached a breaking point on May 18 when a popular store manager was fired for refusing to engage in union busting.

Two hours after learning of their manager’s dismissal the entire shift walked out forcing the store to close early.

“She was a large reason a lot of us were still with the company” said barista Sophie Ryan of her former manager.

“Starbucks loves to push this agenda of togetherness equality and of partnership” said Ryan. “We’re looking to make sure they’re keeping up with that agenda and making sure that people can actually live off of what they do while loving it.”

The union election is presently underway via mail. Votes will be tallied on June 3.

LEARNING THROUGH EXPERIENCE

Most of the baristas are high school and college students and had little knowledge of unions a few weeks ago but Ryan said that organizing and striking has brought them closer.

“We decided on our strike on Wednesday after we had been protesting for a couple hours” Ryan said. “We ironed out all those details as a team and although the next couple days were incredibly hot the morale of our strike was pretty high.”

The strikers’ spirits were boosted on the picket line in front of the store by donations of popsicles and donuts and by honks from sympathetic passersby. Strike visitors included representatives of the South Carolina AFL-CIO and Theatrical and Stage Employees (IATSE) Local 347 as well as workers from other Starbucks stores. A GoFundMe strike fund appeal quickly met its goal as the news spread online through the state’s network of progressive organizations.

Late Friday afternoon the baristas ended their strike after Starbucks reopened the drive-thru window using partners from other area stores as strikebreakers. Company managers also held one-on-one meetings with each employee. Still Ryan remains confident of a union victory noting the unanimous support for the strike among Millwood Avenue store workers.

If the union vote is successful the Columbia store will follow the Pelham Road Starbucks in Greenville which became the first South Carolina Starbucks location to win union representation on May 16. Baristas at stores in Sumter and Anderson—where Donald Trump got 70 percent of the vote in 2020—have also filed NLRB petitions.

'WILL NO LONGER BE SILENCED'

The organizing drive in Columbia moved very quickly after Ryan reached out to the Greenville workers in March and they connected Ryan to Starbucks Workers United organizers in Buffalo.

Since then Ryan has maintained regular contact with a network of pro-union Starbucks baristas across the Carolinas all of whom share concerns regarding low pay understaffing and punishing workloads as the company imposes new productivity demands that are the coffeehouse version of the textile industry stretch-out.

At the same time many baristas take pride in being considered partners and note that Starbucks’ is one of a few reliable job options for queer and transgender Carolinians.

For several years South Carolina has held the distinction of being the state with the lowest rate of union density in the country. Less than 2 percent of the state’s workers belong to unions. But South Carolina AFL-CIO Vice President April Lott said the baristas are a hopeful sign of growing restiveness on the part of the state’s workers.

“Starbucks and South Carolina workers are finally tired of being mistreated harassed and given less than what they deserve” Lott said. “Their voices will no longer be silenced.”

The Starbucks Workers United union campaign continues to produce astounding election wins week after week. As of this writing more than 260 stores have petitioned for National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) elections: The union has won more than 70 NLRB elections most by overwhelming margins and has lost only nine elections. The union has won elections throughout the country including in places where union victories are rare including in Mesa Arizona; Boone North Carolina; Jacksonville Florida; Knoxville Tennessee; Augusta Georgia; and Overland Park Kansas.

Last Monday workers in Greenville South Carolina voted eight to one to become the first unionized store in the state. Greenville has a deserved reputation as being “among the most relentlessly anti-union cities in the nation” as The New York Times described it in 1977. Starbucks Workers United’s victory there is arguably one of the most remarkable union wins in recent years.

South Carolina Has Lowest Union Density in the Nation

For the past two years South Carolina has been the least unionized state in the country and is the only state with a union density under 2 percent: South Carolina’s union density in 2021 was just 1.7 percent. The next lowest state North Carolina was 2.6 percent.

Most recent union campaigns in the state have failed: In a campaign that lasted for several years before a defeat in 2017 the machinists union was met with a blistering anti-union campaign inside and outside of Boeing in North Charleston South Carolina. Then-Republican Gov. Nikki Haley stated “We discourage any companies that have unions from wanting to come to South Carolina because we don’t want to taint the water.”

Then-Governor Haley’s labor director Catherine Templeton said on her first day in office “Let me be very clear … this is an anti-union administration.” The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce — which has had links to anti-union organizations like Union Free South Carolina and Palmetto Shield — also discourages unionized firms. When its CEO retired in 2020 he listed “Keeping Unions out of South Carolina” among his major accomplishments.

Greenville Is the Most Anti-Union City in the State

Greenville is even more anti-union than the rest of South Carolina. The metropolitan area has only seven employers with any union workers three represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers two by the Teamsters one by the Teamsters and the United Food and Commercial Workers and one by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Moreover over the past decade the city’s unionized workers have not participated in a single strike protest or walkout.

The Greenville area has had an extraordinarily lawless anti-union history. In one especially bloody incident at the Chiquola Mill in Honea Path South Carolina just outside Greenville seven union supporters were shot and killed during the 1934 national textile strike.

In the 1970s the J.P. Stevens textile mill in Greenville along with its other mills in the Carolinas became the country’s worst labor law violator. When it finally recognized the union in 1980 The New York Times reported that the “truce” marked “the end of one of the ugliest episodes in recent labor history: a 17-year war during which Stevens repeatedly harassed or fired union activists.”

Marketing anti-unionism:

The Greenville Area Development Corporation has stressed that weak unions are a major reason firms locate there boasting that “In 2021 the private sector unionization rate for the Greenville area was only 0.3%. The Greenville Metropolitan Statistical Area is the least unionized Metropolitan Statistical Area in the United States…. There have been no reported work stoppages reported in the past ten years.” Even with a 0.3 percent private-sector unionization rate the Greenville Chamber of Commerce lists “Promoting a Union Free Environment” prominently among its major policy and economic goals.

Greenville is also home to several leading law firms that specialize in fighting unions. The nation’s second-largest union avoidance law firm Ogletree Deakins was founded in Greenville in 1977 with 11 lawyers — along with five in Atlanta Georgia. It now has more than 800.

Ogletree has played a key role in keeping Greenville and South Carolina union-less over the past several decades. It represented J.P. Stevens and it helped several foreign auto transplants fight unionization causing one recent profile to call it a “witness to history.” Attracted by the city’s anti-union reputation Starbucks firm Littler Mendelson alongside Jackson Lewis — the nation’s first- and third-largest union avoidance law firms — have long-established offices in Greenville.

Starbucks’s blistering and unlawful anti-union campaign:

For a corporation which consistently and prominently tries to associate itself with progressive values Starbucks has engaged in one of the most brutal anti-union campaigns of recent decades. The union’s remarkable success has likely obscured some of the intensity and lawlessness of the anti-union campaign.

Starbucks’s anti-union campaign in Buffalo New York last fall was comparable in intensity and lawlessness to anything that Amazon or Walmart have ever done to crush unions. In May the Buffalo regional NLRB office issued a complaint alleging that Starbucks committed more than 200 violations of federal law an extraordinary number probably not seen since the United Auto Workers’s campaign at Caterpillar over several years in the 1990s.

Starbucks is alleged to have committed hundreds of other unfair labor practices across the United States. The NLRB currently has opened more than 100 allegations of unlawful anti-union behavior. On May 20 the NLRB imposed a bargaining order on Starbucks at the only Buffalo store at which the union had lost a rare remedy only used when unlawful actions make a fair election impossible for the foreseeable future.

In addition to unlawful dismissals and other illegal actions in Buffalo Starbucks management has fired workers in Phoenix Arizona; Memphis Tennessee; Kansas City Missouri; Raleigh North Carolina and at multiple other locations.

How Did Starbucks Workers Pull Off Greenville Victory?

Given the city’s anti-union reputation perhaps the most remarkable thing about the Greenville victory is that pro-union workers won there pretty much the same way they’ve won at almost every other Starbucks store across the country.

Intrepid worker-organizers lead the Starbucks union campaign:

After resisting the company’s anti-union onslaught Starbucks Workers United won two NLRB elections in Buffalo in December 2021. In the six months following those two historic wins in Buffalo the union campaign has constructed a replicable model based around the dynamism of its intrepid self-assured worker-organizers at stores all across the country.

New activists who reach out to the campaign by email Twitter or through the Facebook page have been trained via Zoom meetings on how to organize their own stores. They then go on to play leading roles in organizing other stores in their own region. In regions such as the Boston Massachusetts area worker-organizers have built up an incredible campaign infrastructure. The organization of the Greenville store — the first store in South Carolina to go union — followed a now-familiar pattern for the union campaign.

Shift supervisors as lead organizers:

The lead organizer at Greenville Hayden Mullen first reached out to the union campaign via email and was connected with one of the experienced Buffalo-based organizers. Mullen had no previous involvement with unions; he had worked as a barista at another Starbucks outside Spartanburg South Carolina before transferring to the Greenville store to become a shift supervisor.

Shift supervisors have no managerial authority and thus are eligible to vote in NLRB elections. Most baristas trust their shift supervisors — often long-serving employees — more than store or district managers. Shift supervisors have been organizers at several stores which has assisted the organizing. Some stores have had vocal anti-union shift managers which can undermine organizing. However at the first store to unionize in the South — in Knoxville — all the shift managers opposed the union but it still won because the store had an unusually determined and charismatic lead organizer.

Inspired by Sen. Bernie Sanders:

Mullen had worked at American Eagle Dunkin’ Donuts Krispy Kreme and other low-wage service jobs. He was inspired and politicized by Sen. Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaigns — as have other Starbucks activists — and strongly supported workplace organizing.

Before the Greenville union campaign became public last fall Mullen informed his store manager at his former store in Spartanburg — who was sympathetic — that Starbucks would benefit from a union. Mullen’s Greenville store manager in contrast was curious about how unionization would change her job — which Mullen explained to her satisfaction. The Greenville store manager however later participated actively in the anti-union campaign which Mullen attributes to pressure from Starbucks corporate representatives.

Starbucks has consistently worried that store managers are insufficiently dedicated to the anti-union campaign and both CEO Howard Schultz and Executive Vice President Rossann Williams have implored them to get more involved. Some managers viewed as being too sympathetic to the union campaign have been reassigned or even fired from their stores.

From Zoom to petitioning for an election:

Mullen first had a Zoom meeting — followed by other contacts by Zoom email and text — with a Buffalo-based Starbucks Workers United activist and was given a step-by-step guide to the unionization process: how to print NLRB authorization cards; how to approach coworkers about signing cards; how to mail the cards and petition the NLRB for an election; and how to draft the “Dear Howard” letter requesting recognition.

The entire process from Mullen’s first Zoom meeting to mailing off the store’s authorization cards — signed by 75 percent of the store’s workers — took little more than one week at Greenville.

Anti-union reputation not an obstacle:

Mullen said that Greenville’s anti-union reputation did not impede organizing. Some workers had negative views on unions primarily because they had worked at anti-union corporations such as Target where management had expressed anti-union views. Others wanted reassurance that it was legal to form unions in South Carolina.

However when Mullen explained that this campaign was about getting respect and improving daily conditions and that workers would negotiate their own collective agreement most signed cards and subsequently voted for the union.

Throughout the campaign Mullen kept secret the identities of union supporters so as not to expose them to management retaliation. Starbucks has allegedly fired more than 20 union activists while others have allegedly been disciplined for minor infractions of rules — which would not have been enforced prior to the union campaign — or have had their hours reduced drastically.

Starbucks’s anti-union campaign:

The Greenville store got its vote scheduled within a month of having petitioned for an election. In most cases Starbucks’s Littler Mendelson legal team has done everything possible to delay elections and vote counts.

When the store’s organizing committee is small — as measured by the number of signatures on the “Dear Howard” letter — Starbucks has generally facilitated faster elections believing that it can win these ones. However even in most of these cases as in Greenville management has significantly underestimated support for the union.

One-on-one anti-union meetings:

Prior to the election Greenville management did not hold group captive-audience meetings — which at other stores have often proved ineffective or even counterproductive for management — and instead focused on one-on-one anti-union meetings with store “partners.”

These meetings were conducted by a combination of the store manager district manager and a regional manager. In the meetings the managers asserted that the things workers most cared about such as the ability to transfer from store to store could be lost under a collective bargaining agreement.

Benefit threat:

Management also repeated the threat — first stated by CEO Schultz in early May then repeated by Starbucks headquarters and subsequently amplified by district and store managers around the country — that Starbucks cannot extend upcoming benefit increases to stores already engaged in bargaining and those who have voted to unionize.

In reality organizing and bargaining committees have already informed the company that they will not object and have called on it to extend any benefit increases to all partners; thus the only reason that management has repeated this (almost certainly unlawful) threat is to disrupt the momentum of the campaign. The union has filed a complaint with the NLRB on this issue.

Starbucks’s scaremongering didn’t work:

After management’s one-on-one meetings the lead union organizer talked with workers about Starbucks’s threat to eliminate benefits for unionized stores including the ability to transfer stores and other scare-mongering talking points. Most were satisfied with his reassurances Mullen said.

Mullen believes the one-on-one meetings discouraged some of the store’s pro-union workers from voting. But only one worker voted “no” and that worker told Mullen that he mailed his ballot early and that if he had spoken to Mullen prior to sending it he would likely have supported the union. Thus despite the extraordinary result in Greenville — an eight-to-one win for Starbucks Workers United — Mullen was disappointed that the margin of victory wasn’t bigger because some pro-union workers decided not to vote.

Union campaign spreads beyond Greenville:

Three other Starbucks stores in South Carolina — in Columbia Anderson and Sumter — have petitioned for NLRB elections. Last week workers at the Columbia store participated in a three-day strike to protest Starbucks’s sacking of the store’s manager. Other than strikes by McDonald’s workers who were part of the Fight for $15 a three-day strike over unfair labor practices at a non-union employer is a rare event in South Carolina.

Other Starbucks stores will likely petition for NLRB elections soon. Mullen has already reached out to the other Greenville stores. If the campaign continues to spread and win Starbucks Workers United might challenge Greenville’s reputation as the most anti-union city in the country.

Starbucks Union Is Reaching Areas Other Union Campaigns Couldn’t

Over the past several months Starbucks Workers United has won victories — often by overwhelming margins — in several locations in which unions are unaccustomed to winning. By mid-May stores in almost every state in the South had petitioned for NLRB elections and activists believe the campaign would have spread even more widely if not for the terminations of the “Memphis Seven” early in the campaign. Now it is spreading in South Carolina.

In 2016 then-Governor Haley’s labor director Templeton — a former Ogletree Deakins lawyer who was “the only woman involved in three successful defeats of the historic United Auto Workers drive on Nissan in Smyrna Tennessee in the late 1990s” — warned a Greenville business audience about a new poll showing growing support for unions among the state’s newer residents: “It’s a shocking result especially for those of us who were pretty sure we were anti-union…. [South Carolina has a] new demographic that we need to be aware of. And it’s only going to continue to become more of a majority.”

Templeton was fretting over a poll but Starbucks Workers United has won an election in the nation’s most anti-union city. The newly unionized Greenville workers are the demographic that terrifies anti-union ideologues like Templeton and more workers will likely follow their courageous example.

The union campaign has developed a grassroots dynamism that appears replicable thus enabling it to spread even to cities and regions with ferocious anti-union reputations. Union revitalization in the U.S. will almost certainly require many more such campaigns which are based to a significant degree on worker self-organization.

The campaign’s remarkable victory in the U.S.’s most anti-union city might just be a harbinger of things to come. If Starbucks Workers United can win in Greenville it just might be able to win anywhere.

On Friday ahead of the three day Memorial Day weekend allies and workers gathered outside Starbucks as part of an informational picket to demonstrate solidarity and support for the effort.

To date 68 Starbucks stores across the country have voted to unionize and 240 stores have begun the process towards unionization. Only four stores have voted against the effort to unionize. In Rhode Island ballots have been released to the Pace Blvd Starbucks workers. They will submit their votes over the next couple of weeks with the ballot count on June 14 2022.

Starbucks has been aggressively fighting the union campaign. ”Starbucks has been acting very malignantly with all the unions. Things like firing people things like cutting people’s hours and that’s not the treatment of a corporation that actually cares” said union organizer Cassie Burke an employee at the Pace Blvd Starbucks.

As for how the effort to unionize is going at their store Burke was confident. “We feel really good about where we are. Everyone’s on the same page; we’re ready to make this happen together.”

Since April people from all over Rhode Island have been showing their solidarity. When ordering at the Starbucks stores they have been given different names to be written on their coffee cups such as “Union Strong” “Solidarity” and “Union Yes”. They have also made sure to give cash tips marking the bills with messages that echo the need for a union with stickers stating “This Payment Made Possible By Union Wages.”

As of 9.00am EST the number of complaints were continuing to grow more than three hours since the reports started flying in.

Of the complaints submitted to Downdetector 94 percent involved problems experienced on the app.

But reports have also started cropping up in Minneapolis as Americans living in the Central Time Zone started waking up.

As of 10.00am EST the map showed significantly fewer reports on the West Coast but the morning is just getting started for many Starbucks users there.

It's no secret that many of us rely on that first cup of coffee to help us face the day. Luckily with the introduction of apps the time between the alarm blaring and being able to take that first sip has gotten even shorter for those who prefer to have someone else make their cup of Joe. In fact Starbucks drinkers have long had the luxury of using their phones to pay for their Iced Caramel Macchiatos ahead of time avoiding those long morning rush lines since 2014 (via Geek Wire).

Though mobile ordering has made life easier for some there is one group that may not be exactly head over heels about the process. Starbucks baristas have expressed their disdain over mobile orders in the past — in one TikTok video a barista bemoans customers who place mobile orders while they're already in the drive-thru lane. Regardless of baristas' disdain for some customers' mobile ordering etiquette 25% of all orders at company-owned US Starbucks stores in the second quarter of this year were made through mobile ordering Business Insider reports. A large number of customers have clearly made the app a part of their Starbucks routine which is exactly why people weren't so happy with the app today."

Home to the state Capitol and its flagship university. Squeezed onto an isthmus between Lake Mendota and Lake Monona with three other lakes in the area. Bike lanes and outdoor activities galore with restaurants and bars to match.

All of those qualities make Wisconsin’s second most populous city a popular destination for visitors especially future current and past college students.

So what to do when you’re done touring campus or jumping around at Camp Randall?

There are plenty of options and everyone’s must-do lists are different. But here are some quintessential Madison things every visitor should do at least once.

A visit to the capital wouldn't be a visit without seeing the Capitol itself. Free tours are offered daily and offer a look at the building that was modeled after the U.S. Capitol. The dome the only granite dome in the country also is one of the largest by volume. The building is the tallest in Madison — cemented by a state statute that forbids any building within a mile from being taller. During the summer the tour takes visitors to the sixth floor museum and observation deck for views from near that highest point.

The building is open to the public from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends and holidays. Free tours are offered daily year round except on select holidays. They start at the information desk in the central Rotunda on the hour (except for noon) from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Saturday and from 1 to 3 p.m. Sunday with an extra 4 p.m. tour on weekdays in the summer. The tour lasts 45 to 55 minutes and is accessible up to the fourth floor. Reservations are not required. See tours.wisconsin.gov or call (608) 266-0382 for more information.

The University of Wisconsin’s Memorial Union Terrace on Lake Mendota is the place to be in Madison in the summer. Colorful sunburst chairs and tables are scattered around the Terrace for taking in views of the lake and live music on summer weekends with a giant chair serving as a prop for graduation photos. Brats burgers barbecue and beer are available outside with pizza salads ice cream coffee and more available inside. On the west side of the Terrace Outdoor UW rents kayaks canoes and stand-up paddle boards for paddling on the lake.

State Street

State Street is in the heart of Madison connecting the UW campus with the Capitol. The street is only open to pedestrians cyclists and buses and is lined with shops bars and restaurants from chains to local favorites. It's about a half mile walk from the west end to the east perfect for a leisurely stroll with shopping eating and drinking along the way.

At the western end the University Book Store sells all manner of UW apparel plus textbooks for students.

Also near the western end State Street Brats is a quintessential college bar and one of the best spots to watch a game if you're not going to Camp Randall or the Kohl Center. The bar and restaurant is known for its red brat made from pork and beef which gives it the red color. Other bar favorites round out the menu including burgers and cheese curds plus vegetarian and gluten-free options. A beer garden outside fills up quickly on nice days.

Near the eastern end is The Orpheum Theater which was built as a vaudeville venue and movie theater in 1926 and today plays host to local and national acts throughout the year.

Also near the eastern end is Paul's Club a popular bar known for a large petrified oak tree that rises from the center of the bar and survived a fire in 1993 and a move in 2012.

Part of UW’s Lakeshore Nature Preserve this peninsula jutting out into Lake Mendota offers nearly 360-degree views of the lake the Capitol and the university. From Lot 130 it's less than a mile walk along a wheelchair accessible path to the Point. Six reservable fire pits are scattered along the route with firewood and grates provided.

Picnic Point is a small part of the 300-acre preserve that stretches along 4.3 miles of the shoreline. A handful of trails travel through the preserve including through a resorted prairie to Frautschi Point for more great views and to Raymer’s Cove lined by small sandstone cliffs.

It would be easy to spend an entire day in this 1200-acre National Historic Landmark on the south side of Lake Wingra with more than 17 miles of trails winding through restored prairie wetlands and woodlands. Start at the Visitor Center 2880 Longenecker Drive which sits on the northern edge of the Curtis Prairie the world’s oldest ecologically restored prairie. Trails around the center also wind through the 4-acre Wisconsin Native Plant Garden which contains hundreds of native species and the Longenecker Horticultural Gardens which has one of the continent’s largest displays of lilacs. To the north and east are two woodlands with a handful of effigy mounds.

The Arboretum is free to visit. Pets and picnics are not permitted. The Visitor Center is open 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Monday-Friday and 12:30-4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Trails and parking lots are open 4 a.m.-10 p.m. daily.

Another free natural opportunity in Madison Olbrich’s 16 acres of outdoor gardens feature everything from roses and hostas to wildflowers and ferns. The gardens are also home to a Thai Pavilion a gift from the Thai government and the Thai Chapter of the Wisconsin Alumni Association to the university. The pavilion is only one of four outside of Thailand and the only one in the continental U.S.

Also at Olbrich is the Bolz Conservatory a glass pyramid greenhouse filled with tropical plants and free-flying birds that hosts a popular butterfly exhibit every July.

Both the outdoor gardens and the conservatory are wheelchair accessible. The outdoor gardens are free to visit and are open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. daily April-September and 10 a.m.-4 p.m. daily October-March. The Bolz Conservatory is open 10 a.m.-4 p.m. daily; admission is $6 for visitors age 13 and older $3 for children (ages 6-12) and free for kids 5 and younger. Admission is free for everyone from 10 a.m. to noon Wednesday and Saturday.

Custard might be king in Wisconsin but in Madison these two battle it out for ice cream queen status.

Babcock wins when it comes to history. The dairy plant there has been producing ice cream using the same recipe since 1951 and selling it in a student-run store on campus at 1605 Linden Drive along with Daily Scoop locations in Memorial Union and Union South. The main store usually has around 22 flavors available from staples like Union Utopia (vanilla with peanut butter caramel and fudge) to specials like Bec-key Lime Pie which was first made in 2013 in honor of then-Chancellor Rebecca Blank.

You can now find more than 100 Chocolate Shoppe ice cream flavors in 400 restaurants and shops around the country — including Chocolate Factory locations in the Milwaukee area — but it's better closer to the source. The company has four locations in the Madison area including one at 468 State St. Zanzibar Chocolate made with three kinds of chocolate is a favorite and has inspired spinoffs like Zanzimint and Zoreo. The shop also offers a variety of allergy-friendly and vegan options.

You’ll have to visit on a Saturday to peruse this farmers market on the Capitol Square which bills itself as the country’s largest producers-only market. Vendors sell everything from flowers and fruit to baked goods and beef. Some popular vendors sell out before the market ends; get there early for the best selection. The market is open 6:15 a.m.-1:45 p.m. April-November. In the winter the market moves indoors to the Garver Feed Mill.

There’s also a smaller market held on the 200 block of Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. from 8:30 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. on Wednesdays in the summer.

Madison is the best city in Wisconsin for urban biking with a platinum award from the League of American Bicyclists the second-highest award given to bicycle-friendly communities and the only one in Wisconsin. Paved bike trails and protected bike lanes wind through the city and along its lakes. Try the John Nolen Path and Monona Trail around the southern half of Lake Monona for views of the Capitol and city skyline.

BCycle is the city’s bikeshare system with a fleet of e-bikes and dozens of stations scattered around the city. Passes for single rides (up to 30 minutes) are $5; day passes are $15.

The history of Madison's other lakeside terrace is an interesting one that involves one of the country's most famous architects Frank Lloyd Wright. The Wisconsin native first proposed a design for a civic center linking Lake Monona with the Capitol in 1938 but his vision wasn't realized until 1997. The curvilinear design mimics another one of his famous commissions New York City's Guggenheim Museum.

The building's Rooftop Garden offers views of the lake and the Capitol and includes a memorial plaque and benches dedicated to Otis Redding the ""King of Soul Singers"" who was killed in a plane crash on Lake Monona while on his way to a concert in Madison in 1967.

Also on the rooftop is the Lake Vista Cafe offering lunch with a view from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday.

Hourlong tours of the building are offered at 1 p.m. Thursday through Saturday. They cost $5 for adults $3 for students (ages 5-17) and are free for kids 4 and younger.

In 2018 the Madison Area Sports Commission launched Bucky on Parade a public art display that featured 85 life-sized Bucky Badger statues around town. Many of them were auctioned off that year to raise money for Garding Against Cancer but you can still see a handful outside businesses around town including #GameDayBucky at the University Book Store on State Street Ringo 2.0 at State Street Brats Jump Around Bucky at the Great Dane downtown Graduation Bucky at Bascom Hall and Friday Night Fish Fry Bucky at The Edgewater hotel.

Madison breweries

Milwaukee might be Wisconsin’s Brew City but Madison has its share of breweries including specialized producers like ALT Brew a completely gluten free brewery and Funk Factory Geuzeria which brews traditional Lambic beers.

Two are within a block of the Capitol (and each other): Young Blood offering an IPA- and sour-focused lineup and the Great Dane a brewpub that now has five locations around Wisconsin.

On the East Side Giant Jones is one of the few women-owned breweries in the state with a lineup of certified organic beers. Look for the pink door around the corner from Old Sugar Distillery another spot worth a visit if spirits are more your style.

An institution in the shadow of Camp Randall Mickies serves football-sized portions for breakfast and lunch in a diner setting that hasn’t changed much from when it opened in 1946. Red swivel stools still surround the counter in the center of the room with small booths lining the walls. Malts and milkshakes massive chocolate-chip pancakes and the Scrambler — potatoes topped with three scrambled eggs a choice of meat two vegetables cheese and gravy — are favorites. Lines to get a table inside the seat-yourself restaurant can be long on weekends; get there early or go during the week for a shorter wait. The diner is open 7 a.m.-2 p.m. Wednesday Thursday and Sunday and 6 a.m.-2 p.m. Friday and Saturday.

The aptly named Old Fashioned serves not only Wisconsin’s signature drink — muddled by hand with Korbel brandy of course — but also its signature appetizer: beer-battered cheese curds — some of the best in town. The restaurant on the Capitol Square features other Wisconsin items on its menu including beer cheese soup Green Bay-style chili (that’s served over spaghetti noodles like Chili John’s in Green Bay) and fried cod perch or walleye every day.

L’Etoile or Graze

The farm-to-table French-inspired restaurant L'Etoile is the spot to go for a classy night out. Chef-owner Tory Miller is a James Beard award winner and the views of the Capitol match the food. Reservations are recommended and are available online.

L'Etoile's more casual (but still classy) cousin Graze is next door. Also owned by Miller the gastropub restaurant serves a Friday fish fry and weekend brunch in addition to a regular menu that features everything from burgers to bibimbap. There's also a street-side patio with views of the Capitol. Reservations are available online although you might have better walk-in luck than at L'Etoile.

EAST ST. LOUIS Ill — Sirens could be heard coming down State Street in East St. Louis as community members paraded for change on Saturday.

Young people marched with a message to end the violence at the first-ever City of Champions Youth Stop the Violence Parade and Rally.

Founder Danielle Moore told 5 On Your Side she wanted to get ahead of summer.

""We have so many youth that have been killed and our hurt. Not just our youth elderly everybody. I just wanted to touch these young people prior to so that it'll sink in a little bit. We don't need that"" Moore said.

Earlier this week East St. Louis Mayor Robert Eastern highlighted the city's progress during his State of the City Address.

Easter said the city's homicide rate was cut by 50% in the first five months of 2022 compared to last year.

Non-fatal shootings have also dropped another 20%.

Those on the parade route agreed there was still much more work to be done.



“I just really want the violence just to stop. We just need other avenues to channel our anger as opposed to picking up a gun and killing someone else's loved one"" said Sukeena Gunner.

Gunner lost her teenage son when he was killed at an after-prom party three years ago. He was a star athlete in the area with a bright future.

“He had already received two D-1 Scholarship offers. He was featured in Sports Illustrated so he was well on his way” she said.

Reggie Smith born and raised in East St. Louis has seen his share of the good and bad.

The success of his sauce business Pure Heat he said Saturday is a testament to what an East St Louis “Champion” can do.



""If you put your mind through it and you take all the street knowledge that you have and you roll that over to some business knowledge you can do it"" he said.

Smith and others hoped the event might show young people they have the support they need to succeed.

“We have great people here. We have great athletes. We have great academic scholars here. We have an array of good people here in the city of East St. Louis so we just need to get those people in order. Get our crime in order"" Smith added.

Several speakers including business and state leaders spoke about the importance of education valuing your mental health and taking advantage of resources for children and families.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb2tlc21hbi5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyL21heS8yOC9zdGF0ZS0xYTJiMWItdHJhY2stc3QtZ2Vvcmdlcy1naXJscy13aW4tdGVhbS10aXRsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State 1A/2B/1B track: St. George's girls win team title on strength of record-setting relay teams,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/may/28/state-1a2b1b-track-st-georges-girls-win-team-title/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb2tlc21hbi5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyL21heS8yOC9zdGF0ZS0xYTJiMWItdHJhY2stc3QtZ2Vvcmdlcy1naXJscy13aW4tdGVhbS10aXRsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWFjb25qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9odWRzb24tYmVhdHMtc3QtaWduYXRpdXMtc3RhdGUtc2VtaWZpbmFscy1pbi1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1ib3lzLWxhY3Jvc3NlLWFsZWMtZGlja2Vucy1qYWNrLWplbmtpbnMvOTkyMTczMzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hudson tops St. Ignatius to reach boys lacrosse state tournament,"When the first lace went in the first cleat this season the Hudson boys lacrosse team knew what it had to do.

The first time a glove hit the back of a hand or helmet sat atop someone’s head the focus was already there.

The Explorers knew if they wanted to reach the state semifinal attention to every detail had to be on point.

Because of that laser focus second-seeded Hudson will play in its first Final Four since 2016 on Wednesday after dispatching top-seeded St. Ignatius 19-12 in a Division I Region 2 final on Friday.

“We practice as hard as we can so when we come out here it’s nothing new to us” Explorers attack Jack Jenkins said. “We do what we do and come out and top.”

Never-quit attitude pushes Hudson

They do what they do by staying locked in for 2880 seconds in each game.

There was no let up. There was no quit all season for Hudson (15-6) and its reward is a state semifinal against Dublin Jerome at a neutral site in the final week of the season.

“The whole season we weren’t giving up in the fourth quarter” Explorers attack Alec Dickens said after beating St. Ignatius. “This season we ran as much as possible. Many of us had lock screens of the score from last year. This is one of the biggest moments of our season.”

That lock screen of an 8-6 loss to the Wildcats was as much motivation as it was a tough reminder of just how much St. Ignatius has been the proverbial thorn in Hudson’s side.

For five of the last six seasons the Wildcats ended a deep playoff run by the Explorers and for five seasons Hudson vowed revenge.

When it finally happened the Explorers celebrated into the night.

“I don’t think words can measure how proud I am of this group right now” Hudson coach Brandon Schwind said. “Last year’s regional final was motivation all offseason. Hats off to St. Ignatius that’s a very talented team. With two great teams playing each other we knew it would be the small details that mattered. I’m just super proud of my boys for maintaining focus for four quarters and finishing the game.”

Looking ahead never behind

As the Explorers look toward their first state semifinal since 2016 that concentration on the little things screamed in the face of onlookers in their win over St. Ignatius.

Things like Frank Mulvaney scoring seven seconds before halftime Hudson winning the faceoff and Jenkins putting a shot in at the buzzer stood out.

In the blink of an eye a game that was tied four times in the first half turned into a two-goal Hudson advantage at the break.

The detail continued with keeper J.J. Wright keeping the Wildcats scoreless for 13:32 to allow the Explorers to jump out to a four-goal advantage.

“For Jack Jenkins to put that last one in right before halftime that’s just a huge momentum builder” Schwind said. “But again give credit to the entire team. To come out in the third quarter – we were in the same situation against them at the beginning of the season. We were up at halftime they came pounding back at us and we wound up losing the game. I’m extremely proud of how we played in the third and fourth quarters.”

The win was a microcosm of the will Schwind preaches and the determination he expects.

You don’t average over 15.5 goals per game by simply showing up on game day.

It takes guts.

It takes hard work.

It takes a willingness to drive past the point of exhaustion.

“Lacrosse is such a game of runs” Dickens said. “You have to stay focused. Even if you let up a goal you have to look at the next thing.”

Up next a date with destiny

The next thing is a Jerome team that beat Hudson 17-15 on April 22.

If you’ve been paying attention to the Explorers you know that game doesn’t mean a thing.

“This feels great” Jenkins said. “Last year was terrible especially to see the seniors go. This year we have a couple more practices a couple more games. It’s just great to be out here one more time.”

The Hermits punched in at 7:45 for the two-plus-hour drive to Seton Hall Prep’s athletic facilities and didn’t punch out until after 2:30 with a thrilling 9-8 come-from-behind win that included a two-hour lightning delay late in the first half to earn a berth in Wednesday’s NJSIAA Non-Public Group A championship game.

‘This is one of the best moments of my life” goalie Aidan Peters said. “I’ll never have so many guys behind me in my life. I'm so thankful for it.”

The Hermits were flat out rolling leading 5-1 when the first scattered raindrops began to fall. Seton Hall Prep scored with 2:35 left in the half when the lightning detector sounded across the stadium.

From the goal before the delay the Pirates would reel off seven-of-eight goals to take an 8-6 lead with 1:14 left in the third quarter.

No matter.

“Lacrosse is a game of runs” Peters said. “Our coaches always say that. We just had to fight off their run and then have one of our own and that's what we did. We had the final run and we won the game.”

Matt Vanaman pulled the Hermits to within a goal at the 9:45 mark of the fourth. Noah Plenn tied it with 5:33 to go. Just 27 seconds later Plenn scored again.

“I knew Henny (Luke Hendricks) was going to give me the ball” Plenn said. “He's a great dodger and he passed the ball on the crease. I got pushed into the crease but luckily that went our way.”

The tying goal was etched into Plenn’s memory. The game-winner though. Not so much.

“On the second one I don't really know what happened” Plenn said. “Honestly I just back-handed it in and it worked out.”

Luke Scarpello fed Plenn on the game’s final goal finding him in a storm of traffic in front of the cage. There would be no more scoring just five full minutes of impeccable Hermits defense the last 54 seconds playing a man-down.

The Hermits reached down to a place that had nothing to do with Xs and Os nothing to do with lacrosse.

“This group is just an amazing group” senior Matt Vanaman said. “Before the playoffs we started wearing our RV3 shooting shirts. That was huge. We can't win without our Hermits brotherhood.”

The shooting shirts and heart-shaped RV3 logo honor Matt’s father Robert who passed away in February of 2021. The RV3 logo is a symbol of the bond the team shares. A bond that is passed along from team to team from actual brothers who went through the program to athletes from across South Jersey who share a brotherhood beyond their sport.

“It's amazing” Vanaman said. “I know my dad was with us last game against St. Joe's (Montvale)” Vanaman said. “I know he was with us today and now he's gonna be with us on Wednesday.

“We’re just a brotherhood. When we lost to (Don) Bosco last year we started working ever since. We knew this was going to happen.”

Haddonfield 12 Caldwell 4: The Bulldogs survived a late start a weather delay of nearly 90 minutes and a change in venue to earn its first South Group 1 sectional title. The Dawgs will face perennial power Mountain Lakes for the Group 1 title on Wednesday.

Finn Morgan scored nine seconds after the game was suspended by rain to spark a 6-1 run that closed out the win. Morgan finished with three goals and two assists the lead the attack. Nolan Tully Marcis DeVita and Asher Conrey added two goals each.

The opening faceoff was delayed by half an hour while the school's artificial turf was prepared after a previous storm then was ruled unplayable after the game was stopped by lightning with 2:46 left in the half. The teams moved to another facility across town before resuming with the Haddons leading 6-3.

Southern 7 Lenape 4: Luke Birney tied the back-and-forth affair at 2-2 and 4-4 before the Rams successfully defended their South Group 4 title. After falling behind 2-0 in a scoreless first quarter Aidan Bregman got Lenape on the board to start the first comeback.

Sean Shelko and Birney scored to knot the game at 4 with 1:38 left in the third quarter but the Rams pulled ahead for good with 27 remaining in the third quarter. Lenape did not score in the fourth as Southern pulled away. .

Two of the biggest players in the electronics design automation segment of the semiconductor industry are Cadence Design (CDNS -0.52%) and Synopsys (SNPS 0.16%). In this video clip from the ""Semiconductor Revolution"" show on Motley Fool Live recorded on May 19 Fool.com contributor Nick Rossolillo outlines several metrics that make them high-performing stocks.

10 stocks we like better than Cadence Design Systems

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Cadence Design Systems wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of April 27 2022

Nicholas Rossolillo: Two companies that I'm going to highlight here very briefly Cadence Design and Synopsys. These are the two heavy hitters in this space. You can think of them essentially like Autodesk of the semiconductor industry. These are software companies that help semiconductor firms design and test their chips. They help with integration of chips into a larger computing unit that help with actual software system verification like to make sure the chip is running the software properly. All sorts of cool stuff.

Because it's software again the nitpicky thing with the semiconductor industry is that it's cyclical. That these are like subscription software businesses so you get the nice steady increase in revenue from a software business but they service the semiconductor industry.

These are two really interesting stocks if you're looking for a bet on chips but you don't want to play that cyclical game where one year you're having booming sales and then maybe the next you flatline or have a decline in sales. That can be a roller coaster for some of these chip companies but that's not really going to happen with these two.

Just some quick highlights. You can see both of them very very high gross profit margins. Lots of free cash flow in the last couple of years. Again a software each incremental sale that they make most of that money just goes directly to the bottom line super-efficient operating model. Both of them have lots of cash.

Synopsys I haven't finished doing a complete update because they actually just reported on earnings the other day. I thought it was a little bit unfair maybe to compare Synopsys with an extra quarter of results compared to Cadence Design over the last couple of years. But the long and the short here is both of these companies are I think fantastic.

I don't know that you necessarily need to pick one or the other I think Cadence Design is a popular pick around the Fool. I know I've covered it on a handful of times. But you you're going to get very similar results from both of these stocks I believe. So you can buy both of them or just pick one if you want more stable business performance from the chip industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Eagle-eyed reader Jake Wells of Sanford brought The Rant’s attention to the presence of the billboard which faces the northbound lane of Hawkins Avenue just past the traffic circles at the U.S. 1 interchange.

In 2021 The Rant reported on a misspelled road sign at Cool Springs Road and Boone Trail Road. The sign was corrected within six days of our report setting up a goalpost if T-Mobile’s advertising arm wants to prove the private sector can respond to this kind of coverage quicker than the public sector is able.

From the Samsung Galaxy A53 to the OnePlus Nord N20 5G and a lot more people have more choice than ever if they’re looking to save money and still get a great phone. So it got me thinking: What’s it like to use a cheap smartphone for an extended period of time?

Recently I’ve been tasked with reviewing a few low-cost smartphones and have been surprised at just how few corners they cut these days in particular the $300 Blu F91 5G and the $350 Moto G 5G so I chose them for my experiment. Here’s how it went down.

Recommended Videos

Displays and design

Something I’ve found interesting recently about smartphones is just how adventurous many budget manufacturers are getting from a design perspective. The Blu F91 5G unit I got came in the Sky Blue color which features a really rich gradient on the back. something you don’t always find on higher-end phones. The Moto G 5G comes in a classic gray color (Moto calls it Moonlight Gray) that’s unfortunately more boring. Both are made of plastic but there’s something about the Blu phone that just feels a tad sturdier and more premium.

Then there are the displays. The Blu F91 sports a surprisingly rich 6.8-inch 1080-by-2460 pixel display with 395 pixels-per-inch (ppi) density and a truly impressive level of brightness. The Moto comes with a 6.5-inch decidedly lower-resolution 1600-by-720 (269 ppi) screen that just looks softer and less vibrant to my eyes. Now before I give the win to Blu Moto has chosen to add a 90Hz refresh rate to its display which looks really smooth when in use. But thanks in part to a higher-end processor on the Blu (which I’ll get into in the next section) the F91 is just a better display. To be fair both lack color accuracy and you won’t get a truly flagship experience here but these phones are really nice to use nonetheless.

Winner: Blu F91 5G

Processing speed and cameras

Both of these phones are 5G-capable on most major carriers though it’s important to note that only the Moto G 5G is Verizon compatible. That’s obviously great to see at this price point but all that speed won’t be helpful if there isn’t CPU performance to match. Oddly the more expensive Moto G sports a Mediatek Dimensity 700 chipset while the Blu F91 5G brings a Mediatek 810 to the party. While the 810 technically brings higher benchmarks and Centurion scores with it both are solid-performing chips. While I think the Blu F91 edges ahead a bit — especially when you compare its 8GB of RAM to Motorola’s 6GB — the Moto G feels faster during normal use thanks to the higher refresh rate screen.

Then there’s the camera system. I’m constantly surprised at just how many cameras budget Android phones throw at you — which makes sense when you figure just how important this category has become in the smartphone race. On paper the specs seem similar: S 50-megapixel f/1.8 aperture main camera a 12.5MP f/1.8 wide-angle camera and a 2MP macro lens for the Moto and a 48MP Samsung-designed main sensor with a 5MP wide-angle and 2MP macro on the Blu phone.

But in this particular battle Moto seems to have done just a bit better with the software. I found that the Blu photos though detailed look less natural and the Moto’s images particularly from the wide-angle lens look far richer.

Winner: Tie

Battery life

I’m giving the battery life of these phones its own section because I think it’s a real differentiator. When I reviewed the Blu F91 I noted that there really aren’t many trade-offs with this phone. But when I spent some one-on-one time with the Moto the battery life was really the standout feature. The 5000mAh battery on the Moto G routinely delivered almost two days of reliable use on a single charge which is impressive considering the amount of time I spent watching videos taking pictures and running benchmarks for these reviews.

The Blu F91 is no slouch but its 500 mAh battery just couldn’t quite keep up with the larger brighter display and needs a nightly charge without fail. It is worth noting that the Blu is capable of 18 watts charging over the Moto’s max 10W but I have to give this category to Motorola.

Winner: Moto G 5G

Extras: What you get with your phone

One of the impressive things about the Blu F91 5G is just how much value is crammed into the box. The F91 comes with an 18W charging brick a really high-quality USB-C cable decent wired headphones  and even an impressively rugged TPU case. The Moto comes with well just the charging components.

Some of this might be smoke and mirrors on the part of Blu to distract from some of the F91’s shortcomings but I can’t help but wonder how far it would go toward convincing me to love the Moto G 5G if Motorola had just included a few little extras in the box.

Winner: Blu F91 5G

Conclusion: Should you buy either of these?

While I did miss premium build quality nicer cameras and more vibrant OLED tech you find on a flagship phone none of that prevented me from using either of these devices in the same way that I would normally.

In general I found video to be much better on the Blu F91 5G  so if that’s a key use case for you then this could be a great bargain. But the battery life and smoothness of the higher refresh-rate screen kept me coming back to the Moto G 5G for everyday browsing and general communications.

While I think either is a solid choice from a practicality perspective I’d probably go with the Moto G 5G . That is until the OLED temptation pulls me back to a flagship phone.

“THE BUY-IN” AT AEW DOUBLE OR NOTHING RESULTS (5/29/2022)

We are live! “The Buy-In” to AEW Double Or Nothing 2022 pre-show is now officially underway.

The camera pans the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas NV. and then settles in at the commentary desk where the duo of Excalibur and Tony Schiavone run down the scheduled lineup for tonight’s show.

From there we are sent to our first video package that breaks down the build-up to a particular match on tonight’s card. The first one up looks at The House of Black taking on Death Triangle in AEW Trios action.

The Acclaimed Kicks Things Off Inside T-Mobile Arena

Once the video package wraps up we hear the familiar sounds of The Acclaimed theme song as Max Caster does his usual freestyle rap gimmick on the way to the ring alongside Anthony Bowens.

Caster drops his usual diss lines aimed at current storylines and AEW stars. Bowens finishes up their ring walk routine with his screaming of the show name and location.

They wrap that up and head to the back and then we cut to the “My Deamons Know how to Swim” promo from Saturday on AEW’s social media channels with Eddie Kingston drinking and talking about being scared of what he’s going to do to Chris Jericho in tonight’s Anarchy in the Arena match.

After that wraps up the commentators send us to another video package this time looking at Owen Hart Foundation and AEW teaming up. This transitions to a look at the men’s and women’s finals of the inaugural Owen Hart Foundation Tournament with Adam Cole vs. Samoa Joe and Dr. Britt Baker vs. Ruby Soho.

Hook & Danhausen vs. Tony Nese & “Smart” Mark Sterling

We return inside the arena after the Owen Hart Tourney vignette wraps up. The announce team grows by one with the addition of Taz and then we head down to the ring for our lone bout on “The Buy-In” at AEW Double Or Nothing 2022.

The theme music for Tony Nese hits and out he comes accompanied by “Smart” Mark Sterling who is in goofy ring attire that gets the commentary team cracking up.

“The Premier Athlete” and “Smart” Mark settle inside the squared circle and their theme music dies down. Now the theme for Danhausen hits and out he comes to an impressive pop from the fans in Las Vegas.

Danhausen stops half-way down the ramp and then the familiar sounds of Action Bronson hits to bring out “The Cold-Hearted Handsome Devil” Hook. Hook also gets a “Road Warrior Pop” as he joins Danhausen and heads to the ring.

All four men are settled in the ring now and Hook’s theme dies down. The bell finally sounds to get this one off-and-running. Hook and Nese kick things off for their respective teams.

Fans loudly chant “Hook! Hook! Hook!” as the two circle each other and lock-up. Nese gets a little control and the fans boo. Hook quickly takes it back and throws Nese down to the mat.

Nese rolls out to the floor to regroup with Sterling and then heads back in the ring. Danhausen tags himself in and Nese laughs. He leans over and allows Danhausen to get a free headlock ala Jerry Lawler with Andy Kaufman in “Man on the Moon.”

Much like the aforementioned Jim Carrey major motion picture we see this backfire on Danhausen as Nese sends him down to the mat with authority. He gets in some more offense dominating Danhausen and then tags in Sterling.

“Smart” Mark enters the ring as Tony Schiavone informs the viewing audience at home that the Bleacher Report app is now working properly for those who were experiencing issues streaming the show on B/R Live.

Sterling lands a shot or two and then quickly tags back out bringing Nese back in to work over Danhausen in what is turning into a one-sided affair thus far. Sterling tags back in but misses a leg drop so he quickly tags “The Premier Athlete” back in.

Danhausen shows off some of the work he has been doing in the ring with Hook as of late as he launches Nese with a suplex before finally making it to his corner to make the much-needed tag to “The Cold-Hearted Handsome Devil.”

Hook starts sending bodies flying all over the place showing off the similar skill-set that his father Taz showed throughout the years executing a wide-variety of suplexes and throws.

Speaking of Taz “The Human Suplex Machine” predicts this one is nearly over just as his son sends Sterling flying across the ring with a suplex following another tag. Just as Hook has Sterling down for the count we see Danhausen request the tag. Hook obliges and Danhausen easily makes the cover and picks up the pin fall victory for his team.

The commentators inform us that Danhausen has gained the revenge he saught on Sterling and Nese with the help of Hook. Decent pre-show opening contest that the crowd thoroughly enjoyed.

Winners: Hook & Danhausen

Special Look At Tonight’s DoN Main Event

We see a look at the video package that tells the story for tonight’s main event between CM Punk and “Hangman” Adam Page and then we shoot over to the commentary table where Taz has left his seat.

Oklahoma’s Favorite “Boomer Sooner” Takes His Seat

Excalibur and Tony Schiavone mention once again that the Bleacher Report app is now fixed. The classic Oklahoma “Boomer Sooner” music plays to bring out “Good Ole J.R.”

Jim Ross takes his seat alongside Excalibur and Tony Schiavone and the trio that will be calling tonight’s pay-per-view event get their final pre-PPV banter out of the way.

After one final hard sell for tonight’s PPV event “The Buy-In” at AEW Double Or Nothing 2022 wraps up. It’s pay-per-view time folks hang tight!

AEW DOUBLE OR NOTHING RESULTS (5/29/2022)

The cold open video package airs to get tonight’s AEW Double Or Nothing 2022 pay-per-view officially underway.

MJF vs. Wardlow

The theme hits to bring out Maxwell Jacob Friedman as it looks like MJF vs. Wardlow will be kicking things off at tonight’s AEW DoN PPV.

After it seemed like this match may not happen with MJf missing his scheduled appearance at the AEW DoN Fan Fest earlier this weekend The Pinnacle leader does in fact emerge and begin making his way down to the squared circle as the fans spread throughout the arena with a defeaning “Assh*le! Assh*le!” chant.

MJF settles in the ring as the chants only grow louder. From there we shoot backstage and see Wardlow accompanied by a number of security guards. The handcuffed former bodyguard for The Pinnacle leader begins making his way to the ring.

The commentators point out how it looks like Wardlow is salivating at the prospect of finally getting to exact revenge on MJF here tonight. He emerges from the entrance tunnel to a roar from the Vegas AEW fans and then heads to the ring where he is let out of his handcuffs.

Our PPV opener is about to get underway. Both participants are in the ring the stage is set and the bell finally sounds to get this one off-and-running. MJF immediately rolls out of the ring. The fans boo and then break out in a “He showed up! He showed up!” chant as Friedman attempts to sneak his way into a free cheap shot from behind to Wardlow.

Wardlow eats it and then snatches MJF up with intentions of delivering his “Powerbomb Symphony.” Instead MJF breaks free and once again heads for higher ground sliding under the ring ropes and trying to get another breather on the floor at ringside.

He finally re-enters the ring and after nearly getting Donkey Kong’d by Wardlow he manages to get a poke to the eye that gives him a bit of breathing room and an ability to establish some offensive ground.

He gets in some shots on Wardlow but it isn’t long before he is screaming out of fear as the bigger man starts to unload his pent up aggression on him. The fans chant “P*ssy!” and “B*llsh*t” at him as he scurries out of the ring and attempts to avoid the fight once again.

MJF yells at the crowd to shut up and hollers over at Wardlow that they can work this out with words. The fans boo and Wardlow is having none of it. MJF tries sealing the deal with a handshake to confirm said-peace-offer however Wardlow hangs onto his grip and as his face turns to stone he once again snatches MJF up and this time successfully begins taking MJF on a trip to a Powerbomb Symphony.

He hits one and the fans chant “One more time!” and then “Two more times!” Wardlow happily obliges. Wardlow picks MJF up again and shows him to all four sides of the building in mid-air before planting him down into the mat with a vengeance. A fourth and then fifth powerbomb appears to be all she wrote.

He puts a boot on MJF’s chest and the referee begins his three-count which could go to 50 if he wanted but instead Wardlow removes his boot after the count of two. He’s not done inflicting damage to his former employer. He hoists him up for a sixth powerbomb and then asks the fans if they want to see a seventh.

Wardlow connects with eight and nine and then pulls the straps down for the tenth and final powerbomb. His symphony is complete and he makes the cover easily scoring the three-count and picking up the victory in what was essentially a one-sided squash match.

With the win per the pre-match stipulation Wardlow is now free from his contract with MJF and is now free to officially sign with AEW. Meanwhile MJF is put on a stretcher and carted to the back.

Winner: Wardlow

The Hardys vs. The Young Bucks

An in-depth pre-match video package airs to tell the story leading up to tonight’s highly-anticipated dream match pitting The Young Bucks (Nick and Matt Jackson) against The Hardys (Jeff and Matt Hardy) in tag-team action.

Once the video package wraps up we return inside T-Mobile Arena where the super hot Las Vegas crowd sets the tone for our second PPV match of the evening.

The theme for The Young Bucks hits and out comes Matt and Nick Jackson. They settle in the ring and their music dies down.

Now the theme for The Hardys plays and as the iconic music rings throughout the arena we see the iconic duo emerge. Matt and Jeff Hardy make their way down to the ring.

Caprice Coleman has joined Excalibur Tony Schiavone and Jim Ross as special guest commentator for this big showdown between The Hardys and The Bucks.

The music and entrances are done and the bell sounds to get this one off-and-running. The crowd explodes as the early action gets underway in our second bout of tonight’s AEW DoN PPV.

We see The Hardys faring well coming out of the gate in this one. After a tag Jeff ends up laid out on the mat. As Jackson looks for a follow-up spot he pops back up and sends him out to the floor. Matt hits the ring and sends the other Young Bucks member out as well.

The fans erupt in a “Brandon Cutler!” random chant which for some reason bugs The Young Bucks. They head out of the ring and scold Cutler for getting a pop from the fans in Vegas.

Back in the ring Matt Hardy continues to dominate the action on behalf of The Hardys taking it to Nick Jackson with ease before eventually tagging Jeff Hardy back into the ring.

Some double-team action from Nick and Matt Jackson lead to the first offensive control for The Young Bucks since the opening bell.

The two knock The Hardys out to the floor at ringside and follow-up with a high spot that pops the already red-hot crowd.

Back in the ring Jackson works over Jeff Hardy as The Young Bucks widen the gap as they settle into a comfortable spot in the offensive driver’s seat in this tag-team tilt.

A big spot off the top in the corner from Jackson backfires as Hardy moves and he crashes and burns on the mat. This leads to Matt Hardy tagging in.

After getting the hot tag Matt Hardy hits and takes out any-and-everything that moves before leading the crowd in a “Delete! Delete!” chant. He hits his Side Effect near-finisher for a close near-fall.

We see a Twist of Fate attempt from Matt not go the way he planned. This leads to another offensive shift in momentum as The Young Bucks once again take over control of the action.

From there both sides see offensive runs going their way nearly finishing the opposing team. Eventually we work our way to the finish which sees two Twist of Fates from Matt Hardy connect before Jeff Hardy heads to the top-rope where he connects with a match-ending Swanton Bomb for the pin fall victory.

Winners: The Hardys

TBS Women’s Championship

Jade Cargill (C) vs. Anna Jay

It’s time for our first championship match of the evening — a rematch with Jade Cargill defending her TBS Women’s Championship against Anna Jay.

After the pre-match video package wraps up we send things back to the ring where “The Dapper Yapper” Justin Roberts brings out the challenger for this title showdown.

Anna Jay’s theme hits and out she comes where she begins making her way to the ring. Her music fades down as she settles inside the squared circle.

Now the theme hits for the reigning and defending champion coming into this match Jade Cargill who begins heading to the ring for our next match of the evening.

Both ladies are in the ring and now the bell sounds to get this one off-and-running. Early on we see Cargill faring well. She begins manhandling Jay while the commentators sing her praises.

Jay finally begins firing up for an offensive comeback of her own. She gets in a couple of spots and has some decent moments but then Cargill begins taking back over.

We see Jay start to show signs of life again as she starts getting in some more offense on the champion. She heads to the top-rope and connects with a flipping Blockbuster.

Cargill heads out of the rnig to catch a breather on the floor. As she does Jay heads out after her to keep the pressure on the title-holder.

As Jay stalks Cargill on the floor we see Kiera Hogan and Red Velvet of The Baddies attack Jay from behind. Jay ends up dumping both on their respective noggins on the floor.

Back in the ring Jay continues to work over the champion in what is looking to be the hardest Cargill has ever had to fight in between the first and final bell since joining AEW.

“Smart” Mark Sterling emerges from the back as the fans boo and Jay continues to put it on Cargill in the ring. John Silver of The Dark Order ends up running down. He takes the neck brace off of Sterling and plants him on the floor with a brainbuster.

In the ring Cargill hits Jay with her Eye of the Storm spot out of nowhere. She immediately goes for the cover but Jay finds a way to kick out after the count of two.

Cargill looks to follow-up on the momentum shifting back into her favor however Jay counters and locks in her Queenslayer. Cargill ends up ramming Jay into the turnbuckles after lunging backwards into the corner of the ring.

Both ladies fight their way to the top-rope in the corner soon after that. We see Stokley Hathaway making his way to the ringside area. Excalibur knows who he is Tony Schiavone says he hasn’t seen him since 2017 and Jim Ross remarks “I’ve never seen him!”

Meanwhile Cargill ends up connecting with her finisher out of the corner to score the pin fall victory. With the win Jade Cargill retains her TBS Women’s Championship.

Winner and STILL TBS Women’s Champion: Jade Cargill

“The Fallen Goddess” Athena Makes AEW Debut

The Baddies join Cargill in the ring after the match for a post-match attack. Kris Statlander ends up running down to make the save.

As Statlander stares down Cargill and The Baddies we hear some music playing. The camera pans over to the entrance area to capture the entrance of the debuting Athena.

Former WWE Superstar known as Ember Moon makes her way down to the ring to a huge pop from the Vegas fans. She enters the ring and then Cargill and co. exit the ring.

They head to the back as Athena and Kris Statlander hold things down in the ring as Anna Jay gets back to her feet.

AEW Trios Match

The House Of Black vs. Death Triangle

We head to another video package to set the stage for our next match of the evening. AEW Trios action is up next here at AEW DoN.

The package wraps up and the theme for The House of Black plays as Malakai Black Brody King and Buddy Matthews make their way down to the ring.

They settle inside and their music dies down. Now the Death Triangle theme plays to bring out Penta El Zero Miedo Rey Fenix and “The Bastard” PAC.

The bell sounds and we’re off-and-running with this six-man tag-team contest. Fenix and Black start things off for their respective teams.

After some early fast-paced back-and-forth action we see Fenix whipped through the ropes in 6-1-9 fashion where he swings back through and goes for a spinning roundhouse kick. It seems that his momentum takes him down to his butt.

Malakai takes a step forward and stares down at him before doing his trademark cross-legged seated pose right in front of him while he is still seated in similar fashion.

We see some tags after that as guys start filtering in-and-out of the match keeping the action fresh and moving quick. The crowd is eating this one up with a spoon much like they have everything else thus far this evening. Great crowd in Las Vegas tonight.

Things build to a spot where all six men are staring each other down with the respective three members of each team staring across from each other on opposing sides of a stand-off.

After this they all start brawling as the already loud crowd erupts. From there the noise only gets louder and louder as these six continue to do their best to steal the show. We see some more big spots as PAC had a stacked pin attempt that appeared to be all she wrote only for the match to continue.

We see another insane spot with Fenix clearing the ring post for an incredible high spot from the ring to the floor. Moments later all six are going nuts in the ring with back-to-back spots. They all end up laid out as Tony Schiavone yells out “We’re going to remember this six-man tag for a long time!”

As the action continues we see flying knees roundhouse kicks and super kicks from everyone as the momentum shifts in this match continue to be drastic and frequent. PAC hits a nice brainbuster and goes for the cover only for Buddy Matthews to break it up.

Things build to a crazy Canadian Destroyer off of the back of a partner and then Death Triangle completely isolates Malakai Black after another wild high spot with a big double foot stomp from the top-rope to the floor connecting for Fenix and Penta.

Back in the ring things continue to go Death Triangle’s way as they look to close the deal. Fenix heads to the top-rope while Malakai wipes out Penta with a big back heel kick. PAC takes out Malakai moments later and then heads to the top-rope.

He looks for his Black Arrow finisher only for Brody King to break it up. PAC takes him out and connects with a slingshot 450 splash. He then clears the ring and takes out Malakai with a back suplex before calling for the Black Arrow again. As Alex Abrahantes tries to interfere and provide a distraction we see PAC land a blatant low-blow on Malakai before heading to the top to once again look for his Black Arrow finisher.

This time the lights go out. When they come back on Julia Hart appears and sprays black mist into PAC’s eyes. This leads to Malakai connecting with his roundhouse kick finisher for the pin fall victory.

Winners: The House of Black

Owen Hart Foundation Men’s Tournament

Adam Cole vs. Samoa Joe

After the AEW Trios match wraps up we head to another pre-match video package. This time the package tells the story leading up to our next match which will feature Adam Cole going one-on-one against Samoa Joe in the finals of the men’s Owen Hart Foundation Tournament.

We return from the break to the respective ring entrances of Adam Cole and Samoa Joe. The “Joe is gonna kill you! Joe is gonna kill you!” chants break out as soon as the bell sounds to get this one off-and-running.

Early on we see Joe dominating the action with relative ease taking it to Cole with dominating and punishing offense as Cole does his best to survive.

Joe has Cole backed up in the corner begging off when he turns to the crowd to taunt him doing his “Bay-Bay!” routine. Cole tries to capitalize on this momentary lapse in focus from Joe but it doesn’t go his way.

Instead Joe continues to take it to Cole as the action spills out to the floor at ringside. Joe chops the hell out of Cole after catching up with him at ringside.

He has Cole seated on a chair on the floor and then backs way up. He builds up a full head of steam and begins charging at Cole. Cole moves at the last moment and Joe crashes and burns.

This leads to Cole shifting the offensive momentum to his favor for the first time in the contest. He sends Joe into the steel ring post shoulder-first before bringing him back in the ring.

Cole continues to work Joe over in the ring as the commentators point out that in addition to Joe after the ring post spot moments ago Cole is also favoring his shoulder in this match. They point out that Cole had his arm taped up before coming out tonight and still has it taped up as we see in the ring right now.

The shoulder of Adam Cole … Bay-Bay! is holding up well at the moment as it is a complete non-issue while Cole beats down Joe and quiets the crowd down in the process.

We see Cole head to the middle rope looking for his Panama Sunrise spot but this backfires on him. Joe tries to capitalize but gets sent from the ring to the floor for his efforts.

Cole follows this up by lunging himself onto Joe on the floor and targeting his weakened shoulder with more offense. Back in the ring Joe connects with an STO out of the corner planting Cole and buying himself some precious time to recover.

The action continues and we see some more shifts in momentum as each guy attempts to finish off the other for the win. In the end we see Joe slap a choke on Cole that seemed to be all she wrote. Instead Cole escapes and thanks to Bobby Fish he “Lowers the Boom” for the pin fall victory to win the first-ever men’s Owen Hart Foundation Tournament.

Winner of the Owen Hart Foundation Men’s Tournament: Adam Cole

Owen Hart Foundation Women’s Tournament Finals

Dr. Britt Baker vs. Ruby Soho

After the men’s finals wrap up we shift gears and prepare for the finals of the Owen Hart Foundation Women’s Tournament.

On that note the commentators send us to a pre-show package to tell the story leading up to tonight’s women’s tourney finals with Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D. going one-on-one against Ruby Soho.

When we return from the break we see guitarist Rich Ward from Fozzy playing the familiar sounds of Britt Baker’s theme song.

Baker emerges as pyro and fireworks explode and then she begins making her way down to the ring for the finals of the inaugural Owen Hart Foundation Women’s Tournament.

With Baker in the ring and Ward finished jamming out on the axe at ringside the theme for Ruby Soho by Rancid plays as the star of the same name makes her way to the ring.

The finals of the Owen Hart women’s tourney are now underway as the bell sounds to get this one off-and-running.

We hear a final loud pop from the crowd as Rancid wraps up the bad-ass live performance that brought Ruby Soho to the ring. These two lock-up and then Baker backs Soho into a corner as fans break out in dueling “Ruby Soho!” and “D.M.D.!” chants.

Soho looks for the clean break but instead gets pie-faced by Baker who backs off in arrogant fashion before re-engaging. Baker goes on to control the offense for the first few minutes until some repeated clotheslines from Soho shifts things into her favor.

Soho ends up sending Baker out to the floor the hard way. She heads outside the ring ropes and builds up a head of steam before launching herself for a dropkick to Baker on the floor landing flat on her back in the process. Ouch.

We see some replays of that one as the action continues and eventually finds its’ way back into the ring. Once inside the squared circle again we see Baker start to take over. She dominates Soho with ease for a lengthy run in the offensive driver’s seat.

After some more offensive changes in momentum things finally build to the finish in this one. Soho had close-call after close-call but when all was said-and-done we see Baker reverse a victory roll from Soho for the pin fall victory.

Winner of the inaugural Owen Hart Foundation Women’s Tournament: Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D.

Dr. Martha Hart Joins Adam Cole Britt Baker For Owen Hart Tournament Presentation

With the win Baker becomes the winner of the first-ever Owen Hart Foundation Women’s Tournament. Soho heads to the back and then Adam Cole re-emerges.

He joins his better-half Britt Baker as the power couple are on-hand for the announcement of the winners of the inaugural men’s and women’s Owen Hart Foundation Tournaments.

Tony Schiavone joins the two at the top of the entrance stage and then does a nice introduction for the widow of the late great Owen Hart.

With that said out comes Dr. Martha Hart to present Adam Cole and Dr. Britt Baker as the winners of the first-ever Owen Hart Foundation Tournament. The fans chant “Owen! Owen!” in a nice feel-good moment.

She reads a lengthy pre-written speech that the crowd showed great respect to popping huge after Dr. Martha Hart finished up each sentence including at the end when she mentioned how she wants to see everyone next year wearing a beautiful hat like that one she’s wearing now (just a girly-looking bow / hat deal).

She then presents Adam Cole and Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D. with their trophy for the Owen Hart Cup as well as their respective Owen Hart Foundation Tournament Championship title belts. Good stuff here.

Mixed AEW Trios Match

Scorpio Sky Ethan Page & Paige Van Zant vs. Sammy Guevara Frankie Kazarian & Tay Conti

It’s time for some Mixed AEW Trios action as we prepare for our next match of the evening here at AEW Double Or Nothing 2022.

After the video package telling the story leading up to this six-person tag-team match wraps up we return inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas NV.

The team of TNT Champion Scorpio Sky Ethan Page and women’s MMA star Paige Van Zant make their way out and head down to the ring accompanied by Dan Lambert of American Top Team.

Out next are their opponents. First to come out is Frankie Kazarian who is still in possession of a championship title that he stole from the ATT gym in Florida in the segment that aired on the go-home AEW Double or Nothing 2022 broadcast earlier this week.

Once Kaz makes his way out he is joined by his two tag-team partners for this one as Sammy Guevara and Tay Conti emerge and elicit loud boos and negative chants from the Vegas crowd after obnoxiously French-kissing each other like their airplane was about to go down.

They finish up their ring walks together and with the other half of the equation in this one now settled into the ring the music fades down and the bell sounds to get this one off-and-running.

After some initial back-and-forth action we see the trio of Guevara Kazarian and Conti settle into the offensive lead in the early goings.

A routine is being established where everytime Guevara Kaz or Conti get a member of the opposing team in a compromising position we hear Lambert at ringside loudly making some kind of remark to try and get heat from the fans.

Equally as often is a heel-get attempt from the other side of the ring as Guevara and Conti keep making comments about how great the other is and continue their vouyerism with deep tongue-kissing in front of a sold-out T-Mobile Arena.

After Jim Ross points out that the four men involved in this Mixed AEW Trios contest are dominating the ring time with Conti and Van Zant yet to tag in as the legal participants in the match we finally do see the women take over center-stage.

Paige Van Zant takes it to Conti early on showing off the pro wrestling skills she has achieved after a short time working out in the squared circle for her in-ring debut.

The women’s MMA star continues to dominate things as 12-Gauge Paige beats down Conti and even makes time to take out Sammy Guevara with a big DDT for his efforts after he tries interfering.

PVZ looks to finish this one off connecting with a big Michinoku Driver for a close near fall. Just as the commentators sing her praises for her in-ring abilities after such a short time of training we see her on the defensive as Conti hits a big Judo throw that launches the former UFC contender half-way across the ring.

As Conti continues to display dominating offensive control “The Spanish God” again joins her in the ring for a blatant and obnoxious make-out session. This time even Frankie Kazarian has seen enough as he decides to walk out on the duo as if they were WWE and he was doing a Sasha Banks and/or Naomi impression. Too much? We continue! And so does the action in the ring.

Kaz ends up re-entering the scene deciding not to walk out like “The Boss ‘N’ Glow Connection.” It’s a good thing for his team as he immediately plays a factor in their favor catching Sky off a springboard off the ropes for a near match-ending high spot.

Moments later we see Guevara look to provide the assist to Kaz but instead accidentally blasting Kazarian with a huge kick that lays him out. Soon after this Sky and Page end up finishing this one off. The Men of the Year and Paige Van Zant end up pulling off the pin fall victory.

Fellow MMA star Austin Vanderford ends up joining Paige Van Zant in the ring for a post-match celebration which includes Dan Lambert taking back the title belts that were stolen from his ATT gym by Guevara and Conti. With the loss per pre-match stipulations Guevara and Kaz can no longer challenge for the TNT Championship.

Winners: Scorpio Sky Ethan Page & Paige Van Zant

Kyle O’Reilly vs. Darby Allin

It’s time for another one-on-one contest and we switch gears for the late singles match addition to tonight’s lineup as Kyle O’Reilly’s music hits.

The reDRagon member makes his way out to the ring for his showdown against Darby Allin who challenged O’Reilly in honor of Sting who was injured by The Elite member weeks ago.

Both guys are in the ring with no pre-match hype package airing like the past bouts on tonight’s card. The commentators note as soon as the bell rings that Allin will look to wrap this one up as fast as he can.

This one gets off-and-running and we immediately see Allin looking to rush O’Reilly only to find himself the recipient of a brutal knee from him before being locked in an arm-bar on the mat.

Allin survives the arm-bar attempt but is still on the wrong end of a one-sided beatdown with O’Reilly gaining the plum Thai clinch when the two stand up. He uses that to control the fan-favorite as he blasts him with repeated knees.

The camera shows a close-up shot of Allin’s mouth busted open and bleeding as he is laid out on the mat. Moments later we see a super slow-motion replay that shows O’Reilly blasting Allin with the running knee that busted him open in the early goings.

Back live O’Reilly connects with a Code Red attempt that nearly finishes this one off. Allin survives however and ends up starting to show signs of life. He hits a Scorpion Death Drop that kills the momentum of O’Reilly.

Darby Allin looks for his Coffin Drop which Excalibur calls his Coffin Splash but O’Reilly has it well-scouted and avoids it. Moments later we see Allin connect with an over-the-top cutter. He then launches himself from the ring to the floor on O’Reilly where both guys look to be possibly injured on the landing.

The commentators acknowledge this on the broadcast and mention the match official Bryce Rymsberg immediately looked to check on the two. Allin recovers and re-enters the ring where he does the same spot on the other side of the ring this time diving right into a guillotine choke from O’Reilly.

Back in the ring O’Reilly connects with Last Supper off the ropes for a close near fall. Jim Ross praises these two for using much more actual wrestling than he expected to see. O’Reilly hits a brainbuster on Darby for a close near fall attempt.

Soon thereafter we see O’Reilly lock Allin in another cross arm-breaker on the mat. He transitions from that into a leg-lock submission attempt as Allin screams out in pain before shifting the move into Sting’s Scorpion Death Lock which Excalibur again blunders by calling it a Sharpshooter.

He should have mentioned still having Owen Hart on the mind after O’Reilly’s pal Adam Cole won the first-ever Owen Hart Foundation Tournament earlier in the evening. Schiavone ends up pointing out the move Allin has as it was clearly intended as an homage to Sting and done to further the story line of Allin looking for revenge on O’Reilly for Sting in this match.

I digress.

The action continues with more near fall attempts and close submission attempts in the ring by both guys. Allin ends up heading to the top-rope for a Coffin Drop attempt. He ends up falling right into another cross-arm-breaker attempt by O’Reilly. The reDRagon member nearly finishes this one off there but Allin ends up surviving.

We see the two end up in a back-and-forth striking match which Allin surprisingly gets the better of. Two times we see O’Reilly using the unbreakable chain to try and finish Allin off. Allin fades but hangs in there. O’Reilly hits back-to-back Penalty Kicks and then a diving knee drop off the ropes for the pin fall victory.

Winner: Kyle O’Reilly

AEW Women’s Championship

Thunder Rosa (C) vs. Serena Deeb

It’s time for another championship match as the AEW Women’s Champion will be decided when current title-holder Thunder Rosa puts her belt on-the-line in one-on-one action against women’s wrestling Serena Deeb.

The in-depth pre-match video package airs to tell the story leading up to tonight’s showdown between Rosa and Deeb for the richest prize in women’s wrestling in AEW.

Once it wraps up the theme for Serena Deeb plays and the Oakland VA. veteran emerges and begins heading down to the ring. She settles in the ring and her music fades down.

Now the familiar sounds of Thunder Rosa’s theme music plays and this time war-paint-and-all out she comes ready to put her title up for grabs in a bout against one of the best female talents in the business.

The bell sounds and we’re off-and-running with one of the co-featured bouts of the evening here at AEW Double Or Nothing 2022.

Someone should tell Martha Hart that Thunder Rosa heard her lengthy post-tourney speech but thought she said tonight when addressing her desire to see beautiful hats worn by all.

I digress again!

We see Rosa faring well coming out of the gate but it isn’t long before Deeb is manhandling the AEW Women’s Champion. The fans are still loud and proud despite yelling as loud as lungs with let them from the beginning of the evening until now.

Meanwhile Deeb continues to show her veteran-savvy controlling and dominating the action in and out of the ring as Rosa barely hangs on at this point in the contest.

Deeb ends up slowing down an offensive comeback attempt by Rosa by locking her in a flying Octopus hold. Rosa ends up escaping however and keeping her championship reign alive as the match continues.

We see Deeb plant Rosa for a near fall and then she goes for the Deeb-Tox spot but Rosa defends well. After avoiding it Rosa starts to take over again only for Deeb to kill her momentum once again. She then locks Rosa in the Stretch-Muffler as the AEW Women’s Champion yells out in pain.

Rosa ends up surviving and then taking over again after that. She hits a big spot that has won her some big matches in the past as the commentators point out however Deeb cuts her off and both end up laid out as AEW referee Aubrey Edwards begins counting both ladies out.

After this Rosa gets back to her feet to break the count. She starts firing up for a big comeback hitting a Death Valley Driver off the ropes for a super close near fall on Deeb.

Now we see Deeb chop-block the back of Rosa knee after coming off the ropes with a full head of steam. She follows that up by locking her in a figure-four leg lock. While still in the hold Rosa lands some smacks and palm strikes which Deeb happily returns.

The exchange leads to both ladies rolling out of the ring where they each crash-and-burn on the floor. Deeb connects with a dragonscrew in the ring ropes as the two look to re-enter the ring.

Deeb-Tox is up next for the veteran performer who tries pinning Rosa afterwards only for the champ to kick out at two-and-a-half. Deeb gets up and connects with a thunderous power-bomb (pun intended) before locking Thunder Rosa in a Texas Clover Leaf.

Rosa yells out in anguish but ends up escaping and countering into a pin attempt. Deeb kicks out. Deeb gets up and then we see a big roundhouse kick land. Deeb heads to the top-rope but is cut off by Rosa.

Rosa ends up bringing Deeb off the top the hard way connecting with a big superplex. She hangs onto the head-and-shoulder control upon landing and stands up to connect with a Fire Thunder Driver for the pin fall victory. With the win Thunder Rosa retains her AEW Women’s Championship in an excellent performance against the equally impressive Serena Deeb.

Winner and STILL AEW Women’s Champion: Thunder Rosa

Anarchy In The Arena: Jericho Appreciation Society vs. Eddie Kingston Santana Ortiz & Blackpool Combat Club

Now the video package airs to tell the story leading up to tonight’s Anarchy In The Arena bout with Wrestling vs. Sports Entertainment on display as Jericho Appreciation Society takes on the team of Eddie Kingston Santana Ortiz and the Blackpool Combat Club duo of Jon Moxley and Bryan Danielson.

Once the video wraps up we hear “The Dapper Yapper” Justin Roberts inform the crowd in attendance that “sh*ts about to hit the fan” in this Anarchy in the Arena bout.

The familiar sounds of Chris Jericho’s “Judas in my Mind” theme song by Fozzy plays as “The Wizard” leads his Jericho Appreciation Society crew of sports entertainers down to the ring as the fans sing along inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas Nevada.

Now the music fades down and the entrances of their opponents begin. Out comes Eddie Kingston and the team of Santana & Ortiz. From there Bryan Danielson and Jon Moxley of the Blackpool Combat Club led by William Regal make their way out.

Mox ends up using a fork to rip at the heads of his own tag-team partners showing off the difference between sports entertainers and wrestlers as he cuts open the domes of Santana & Ortiz. Chris Jericho wants to get out of here which the commentators point out is ironic considering this match was his idea in the first place.

The “Wild Thing” theme for Jon Moxley continues to play deep into the action as the music continues for several minutes into the match as high spots take place in various spots of the building to get this match off-and-running with a bang.

“The Mad King” is shown badly busted open and bleeding all over the place as he brawls with some of the J.A.S. We see Daniel Garcia fight into an offensive lead near the ring. He ends up connecting with a vicious piledriver onto the steel ring steps in a spot that pops the crowd and elicits some immediate replays.

Referee Aubrey Edwards and other officials try and follow the action as it spreads all over the place inside the arena and behind the curtain. We see a very bloody Kingston duking it out before the camera shot changes to Parker hitting Bryan Danielson with a ring bell.

We move to another part of the brawl where we see Moxley throw a full cooler at Jericho’s face to knock him down. The fans are following the action around and pointing their phones at it as the PPV cameras catch up with the brawl in the concord.

Garcia tries dragging Kingston back to the ring to finish this match as Tony Schiavone points out on the broadcast. Jericho tries putting Moxley in the Walls of Jericho or Walls of the Wizard on the time keepers table. They end up breaking through the table where Mox takes a rough spill.

Bryan Danielson and Jake Hager who are both bloody as hell (like literally every other member involved in this match) duke it out near the ringside area. We catch up with “The Mad King” who is nearly covered head-to-toe in blood continues the action out near the concession stands.

The camera pans back to the ring where we see Jon Moxley tearing the top-rope off. All four ring posts cave in as the ropes smack down on the ring mat. Jericho is also in the ring and he beats down Mox shortly after the ring is disassembled.

Now we watch as Mox beats Jericho down with part of the turnbuckle while Danielson fish-hooks at the mouth of Hager with the steel turnbuckle hook. Jericho gets hold of a steel chair and smashes it across the spine of Moxley.

Once some high spots involving ladders and barbed-wire covered boards are finished the camera pans back in the ring Moxley and Danielson get Jericho and Hager down and proceed to elbow the crap out of them over-and-over again. Eddie Kingston joins the fun entering the ring with a can of gasoline.

“The Mad King” dumps the gas all over Jericho and Hager. Danielson and Kingston actual teammates end up brawling with each other before anything else happens. Mox is trying to separate them and in comes Jericho to take advantage. Hager joins him in launching Mox out onto the barbed wire covered board.

Jericho hits his finisher on Kingston and then grabs the turnbuckle. He tells Hager to pull Danielson closer. He hits a big spot there and then goes for the cover but somehow “The American Dragon” kicks out and keeps this match going.

Danielson fires up for a big offensive comeback. He blasts everyone in sight with repeated “Yes!” kicks and then goes for a running knee in the corner. As Danielson looks to be ready to wrap this one up he becomes victim to a shot from behind with a bat from Hager.

Jericho comes in with a Walls of Jericho on Danielson as Hager helps stretch him even more. Danielson eventually loses consciousness and goes out. That’s how this one ends as the Jericho Appreciation Society end up with the victory in an absolutely insane Anarchy in the Arena match.

Winners: Jericho Appreciation Society

Rush Makes AEW Debut Signs With Andrade El Idolo

We shoot to what the commentators build up as very big news from Andrade El Idolo. We see El Idolo seated at a table and he talks about not coming to AEW to be a loser.

He asks if the papers for his newest talent are ready. He is told they are. He then introduces who he bills as one of the greatest pro wrestlers in the world.

We hear a knock at the door and in a nice suit walks Rush. The two do a hand-gesture together and that wraps up the quick segment.

Next TNT Title Challenger Revealed

Next we head to the interview zone where a member of the AEW broadcast team is standing by with Ethan Page Scorpio Sky and Paige Van Zant.

Ethan Page gloats about their victory earlier this evening and talks about being happy that they can now be done with Sammy Guevara and Frankie Kazarian and move on to bigger and better things.

We then hear from Scorpio Sky who also touts beating the aforementioned duo and Tay Conti in the Mixed AEW Trios bout earlier in the show. He then questions who is next to challenge for his TNT title.

Up walks Dante Martin who says they may never have to worry about Sammy Guevara and/or Frankie Kazarian ever challenging for the TNT title again he is still eligible.

Sky gets in Martin’s face and says he’s been impressed with his work as of late. He says he’s going to give him what he wants making a TNT title showdown between the two official for SoCal.

He tells him when he’s laying on his back in SoCal and looking up at the Hollywood sign wondering what happened to remember that he asked for this. He snaps his fingers to end the segment.

AEW Tag-Team Championship

Ricky Starks & Powerhouse Hobbs vs. Shane “Swerve” Strickland & Keith Lee vs. Jungle Boy & Luchasaurus (C)

It’s now time for our co-main event of the evening which will be a three-way tag-team title showdown. This match features Jurassic Express (Jungle Boy & Luchasaurus) defending their AEW Tag-Team Championship against Ricky Starks & Powerhouse Hobbs as well as Shane “Swerve” Strickland & Powerhouse Hobbs.

The commentary team is joined by Taz who will also be calling the action in this co-featured match. We see the ring entrances of Ricky Starks and Powerhouse Hobbs and then the duo of Shane “Swerve” Strickland and Keith Lee make their way out.

Finally the catchy tune for the champs plays and out comes the Jurassic Express duo of Jungle Boy and Luchasaurus. The bell sounds and we’re off-and-running with this title contest.

We see some brawling as soon as the bell sounds and then Jungle Boy hits a high spot from the ring to the floor to take everyone out.

In the ring we see Starks getting beat up by Swerve. He then tags in Keith Lee. Starks meanwhile tags out bringing in Hobbs. The big boys begin going at it as the commentators remark how they may need a bigger ring.

This doesn’t last long however and the two big boys tag back out. We see Strickland and Hobbs going at it now after Lee tags out. During a pin attempt Jungle Boy hits the ring to break things up and keep he and Luchasaurus’ title reign alive.

Jungle Boy then tags himself in the first chance that he got when Swerve got close enough to him. Things build to him trying to hit another big high spot as he leaps from the ring to the floor.

Instead he is caught and held. Swerve tries jumping onto them to help out but doesn’t do much better. Keith Lee ends up leaping over and finally taking him out.

After some more back-and-forth action that included a number of additional impressive high spots we work our way to the conclusion of the contest.

The finish in this one sees Starks attempt to use a title belt shot to steal the victory when Jurassic Express ally Christian Cage arrives on the scene to pull him out of the ring from the floor.

Soon after we see Luchasaurus and Jungle Boy hit a crazy double-team spot out of the corner on “Swerve” Strickland for the 1-2-3. With the pin fall victory Jurassic Express retains their AEW Tag-Team Championship. Excellent match.

Winners and STILL AEW Tag-Team Champions: Jurassic Express

AEW Championship

“Hangman” Adam Page (C) vs. CM Punk

We shoot to the pre-show video package for our main event which tells the story leading up to tonight’s headline bout with “Hangman” Adam Page defending his AEW Championship against CM Punk.

The package wraps up and then “Cult of Personality” by Living Colour plays as the legendary CM Punk emerges. “The Best in the World” makes his way down to the ring to a great reaction from the Vegas crowd.

Punk settles inside the squared circle as his theme music fades down. Now the familiar sounds of “Hangman” Adam Page’s theme hits and the AEW Champion heads out and makes his way to the ring.

With both guys in the ring and “Hangman’s” music cutting off “The Dapper Yapper” Justin Roberts handles the final formal pre-match ring introductions for the challenger and the champion.

The bell sounds and we’re off-and-running with this one. The fans immediately break out in “CM Punk! CM Punk!” chants which spread throughout the T-Mobile Arena. Punk and Page slowly move in on each other going nose-to-nose in the middle of the ring in intense fashion.

We see the two trade some quick shots and then back off. The crowd breaks out in a loud “CM Punk! CM Punk!” chant again which eventually transitions to a split chant with a good percentage of the audience chanting for some “Cowboy Sh*t” from the title-holder.

The commentators point out how you can tell from the way these two are locking up alone that they have a strong feeling about beating down and defeating the other. They show this again with an intense lock-up as soon as J.R. makes the remark.

We see Page drill Punk with a big shot and then slap on a side head lock. Punk shucks him off and sends him into the ropes. The two then proceed to trade back-and-forth chops in vicious fashion.

A “Let’s go Hangman!” and “CM Punk!” dueling chant from the fans in T-Mobile Arena spreads and catches fire as we watch Punk work over Page on the mat looking to secure an arm-submission of sorts.

Page ends up escaping and freeing himself. He returns to his feet where he and Punk begin duking it out once again. Yet again it is “The Best in the World” who gets the better of said-exchange.

He follows it up with some punishing offense beating on “Hangman” before once again showing superior ground work. The crowd actually ends up loudly booing Punk and begin clearly chanting for “Hangman” as the action continues.

Punk heads to the top-rope and leaps off only to be caught by the champ. Page struggles not to drop Punk after catching him but does manage to keep hold of him. He then connects with a fall-away slam. He follows that up with some additional offensive spurts including a leaping lariat after spring-boarding off the ring ropes.

This sends Punk out to the floor where Page follows out after him to continue building on his offensive momentum. Page delivers some more shots on Punk on the floor and then sends him back into the ring. He follows in after him stopping briefly to pose and soak in the adoration from the Las Vegas crowd.

After some more offense from Page in the ring we see Page and Punk end up out on the floor at ringside again. Page lands a big lariat and another big shot on the floor before bringing the action back into the ring. Page purposely sends Punk flying out to the floor for the second time in a row. This angers referee Paul Turner but the match continues regardless.

The commentators talk on the broadcast about the disdain that “Hangman” is showing for “The Best in the World” as these two continue to battle it out here in tonight’s AEW Championship main event.

Page and Punk fight their way over to the corner of the ring where Punk looks to put Page on the top-rope. He does and then climbs up after him. Punk tries for a superplex off the top and the two go sailing down to the mat landing with authority.

Soon after this Punk lands some shots on Page and then snatches him up for a big bulldog spot. He connects with that and then hits another big spot afterwards.

Punk plays to the crowd a bit and then heads over to “Hangman” looking to secure a Sharpshooter (or Scorpion Death Lock of course!) Punk connects with a neck-breaker instead as Page avoided the submission attempt and then goes for a pin fall attepmt.

Page kicks out at two and the match continues. As Excalibur points out on commentary this is where conditioning will start to play a major factor in determining who ends up getting their hand raised in the ring and the gold belt in their travel gear.

We see both guys down and out but when they get up it is Page who sends Punk sailing. He then hits a crazy moonsault onto Punk on the floor. We see replays of this as Excalibur points out that Page may have suffered an injury upon landing.

Page rolls Punk back into the ring and then gets himself in position to hit a big Buckshot Lariat spot. He goes for it but Punk has it well-scouted and avoids it. Punk then locks in the Sharpshooter that he couldn’t manage to fully secure moments ago.

We hear Page screaming out in pain as he looks to escape the hold and keep-hold onto his AEW Championship. He fights and crawls his way to the ring ropes where he eventually grabs them and forces the hold to be broken up by the referee. Paul Turner tries to do exactly that but Punk holds onto the hold for a few seconds for good measure.

Punk looks to have an idea of sorts as we see “Hangman” still feeling the affects of the Sharpshooter and previous offense from Punk. “The Best in the World” ends up heading to the ring apron and he is looking to finish Page off with his own finisher.

He goes for the Buckshot Lariat and then tries to finish “Hangman” off with it. He makes the cover however Page kicks out before the count of three.

Now we see Page recover and begin to take over on offense. He looks for to finish Page off with his finisher now as he calls for and goes for the GTS. Page ends up surviving. Page then goes for another one of his trademark finishing moves but upon going for the cover the referee’s hand only bounces off the mat twice.

The fans actually booed after Punk wasn’t finished off in the last high spot sequence. Page then gets up and plays to the crowd now as Punk is laid out below him.

Page calls for the GTS. He hits it and goes for the cover yet somehow Punk manages to kick out as well. This match is getting some great crowd heat from the fans in Vegas as they are starting to sense the end coming soon.

A loud “Cowboy Sh*t!” chant breaks out as the commentators point out Punk clutching his jaw after taking his own GTS move from Page. The two are both on their knees and looking to get back to a vertical base. They end up duking it out from that position with each drilling the other with big shots while working their way back to their feet.

We see the action spill out to the floor once again with Page in control of the offense. Punk is laid out by the champ who then takes his title and raises it proudly over the fallen wrestling legend gloating that it is still his. He then brings Punk back into the ring and positions himself for the Buckshot Lariat.

He leads the crowd in cheering him on and then goes for the big finisher. Punk ends up countering him just in time hoisting Page up for the GTS but bumps the referee in the process and loses it. Page then connects with his Buckshot Lariat which lays Punk completely out. He can’t go for the cover however as refere Paul Turner is still out like a light.

Page looks around and then spots his AEW Championship title belt. The commentators sell the fact that the hot-headed Page is doing some quick on-the-spot math as he notices the refere is down and out and realizes his ability to use the title to his advantage via a cheap shot.

He gets fired up and waits for Punk to get back up but eventually decides against it. He drops the title belt and instead positions himself for the Buckshot Lariat once again. He goes for it but Punk ends up countering and this time connecting with his GTS finisher. He goes for the cover just as Paul Turner recovers. 1-2-3. CM Punk wins. We have a new AEW Champion and he is “The Best in the World.”

The crowd pops and soaks in the moment as CM Punk is presented with the AEW Championship as “Cult of Personality” by Living Colour plays for the second time this evening. An emotional Punk takes the title and proudly hoists it up in the air soaking in the adulation from the fans in attendance inside the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas NV.

The commentators talk us through some key match highlights and replays including the finish of this title bout main event. We return live to see Punk still celebrating his first title victory in AEW. That’s how the third-annual AEW Double Or Nothing pay-per-view wraps up. Soon after this we head off the air and that’ll do it for this year’s AEW DoN show. Thanks for joining us and remember to follow myself Matt Boone via Twitter @MattBoone0709.

LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 18: Disney Executive Chairman Bob Iger attends the Exclusive 100-Minute Sneak Peek of Peter Jackson's The Beatles: Get Back at El Capitan Theatre on November 18 2021 in Hollywood California.

""Investor and Advisor""

Canva's representative Lachlan Andrews said in a statement with CNBC that the design company is ""incredibly excited to welcome"" Iger as both an ""investor and advisor."" He said that his rich experience of having one of the most ""loved and creative brands in the world"" enthralls the company to work with him.

Iger and Canva have not revealed the size or the amount of investment made. But back in September Canva reported that they raised money making the total company's valuation at $40 billion particularly after a successful $200 million funding round headed by T. Rowe Price a global investment management company.

Canva is notably a female-led and female-founded tech firm with its CEO and co-founder Melanie Perkins who also happens to be the second richest woman in Australia according to an article by Entrepreneur.

CNBC reported that the company has more than 75 million monthly users and was set to achieve a $1 billion yearly revenue run in late 2021. The design company provides services for presentations videos photos and various designs - which rivals Adobe Microsoft and several graphic design software companies.

At least not at first.

The executive has a background in strategy and management consulting that progressed into a career in product development for top tech companies like Google and Amazon. But when he was struck by the urge to start a company he researched the money-attracting industries of the world and then using AngelList saw how many companies were trying to disrupt those industries.

His search yielded thousands of companies that were working on industries ranging from telecommunications and fashion to video games and food. Billions of dollars were going into trucking each year but fewer than 30 startups showed an interest in the field.

“I saw a massive opportunity and few people going after it” Lewis told TechCrunch.

Lewis and Grant Goodale co-founded Convoy in 2015 and since then have brought on a series of high-profile investors. A couple of years after Convoy was founded in a pivotal turn of events the company secured its Series B from YC Combinator’s Continuity Fund a fund that was usually geared toward earlier-stage companies.

More recently Convoy secured a $260 million Series E led by Baillie Gifford and T. Rowe Price that brought the company’s valuation up to $3.8 billion. To date the company has raised almost $1 billion to scale its platform which connects the fragmented network of shippers carriers and brokers across the United States.

We sat down with Lewis to talk about the importance of being customer-obsessed when starting a company why compensation packages in the early days can help you avoid diluting your company too much in future fundraises and how to set boundaries on the compromises you’ll make as a founder.

The following interview which has been edited for brevity and clarity is part of an ongoing series that focuses on founders in the transportation sector.

TC: YC’s investment in your Series B was notable because Convoy at the time was outside the Continuity Fund’s range of portfolio companies. What do you think made Convoy stand out?

Lewis: The YC culture is a really curious one so they didn’t feel like they needed to stay in a particular lane especially with the Continuity Fund which was geared toward early growth-stage companies. When we met I think the breakthrough was just the unique story. People don’t usually realize how fragmented how large how offline the trucking industry is. So YC viewed this as a major disruptive play.

We were excited to work with them because they’re an incubator and accelerator so their whole system is designed around helping founders succeed. They had so many unique programs that helped us be successful and grow that I had never seen from other investors at the time.

You mentioned that a good way to decide on a direction for a startup was to compare industries where there’s lots of money against companies that are trying to disrupt those industries. Is that still a good method?

I think it is a really good method. It would be interesting to pull a list of industries and find out how much money is spent in those industries and then see how many companies are going after those industries. AngelList is a great resource to find the newest most innovative companies that are going after these spaces.

Before I ever started the company I wrote this article in Quora that went viral and was published by Forbes. It was an answer to the question: How to come up with a startup idea. I wrote this really extensive theory basically a playbook. So when I was going to start my own company I was like I should eat my own dog food. I went back and used my own process and I can now say it’s credible because it works.

One of the things it talks a lot about is thinking about specific customers to understand the needs. Who is the customer you’re building for and what is the specific business model you’re going to use?

Many startups pivot a lot. Has Convoy had to evolve at all over the years?

The core business we’re going after has stayed true. We’ve changed the type of trucks that we run most of our freight on and maybe some of the details of what types of trucking jobs we do. But we didn’t have to have a major pivot.

I think we were able to do that because I just went out and talked to everybody in the market before we started which actually helped me get a lot of these great investors from day one.

I talked to everybody I knew in the supply chain space from my work as a consultant. I looked up everyone I grew up with who are now in the trucking industry — my mom’s an ESL teacher so a lot of Eastern European immigrants would come to my house. We helped them get jobs and many of them became truck drivers.

I went to warehouses everywhere got kicked out of a few Whole Foods because I walked around asking things like how they hired truck drivers. I started intercepting truckers at truck stops and talking to them. What sucks about being a truck driver? What sucks about being a shipper? Why is being a broker hard?

That all led to like 100 conversations so when I started pitching angel investors they were kind of blown away that I had conversations with real customers and written all this research data — it wasn’t just an idea that I was pitching. I got a lot of credibility early on with some really powerful investors because they weren’t necessarily used to seeing someone put that much groundwork in before they started pitching.

How has your background in product informed the way you’ve gone about founding a company?

Early on I worked in management consulting where I figured out how established companies could start a new business. For that I’d go talk to like 30 to 40 people in a space and figure out where that was broken. So I had a lot of experience just cold-calling and hacking my way in.

The product experience is being obsessed with customers. You have to understand who that customer is what they don’t like and what they want. If you do that really well and you’re good at hunting and cold calling you’re going to come up with something.

The worst thing to do is to stop with an idea you have just because you think it’s interesting or imagine it could be cool but not understand that there’s a customer who’s actually interested in that. I think that’s where sometimes people get a little bit hung up. They get personally passionate about something but there’s not really a customer or a problem.

You’ve had a series of really large fundraises some of which happened early on. How do you balance getting the funds you need to grow and not diluting too much too early?

I think we were really productive as a company. A lot of the compensation was around equity which I think isn’t that abnormal. We biased toward optimizing to increase the value of the company versus generating cash in the early days. This meant everybody at the company didn’t want us to be diluted everybody had an incentive to create value and drive the company’s success quickly so that we could raise money without diluting further.

So the speed at which we moved was crazy. I remember one of our first investors showed up and wrote on the board “CTFU” — catch the fuck up. Think about that as your mindset. Pretend that you are way behind everybody else. Speed is a big feature of building a startup and it’s also a big feature of not getting diluted because you can show immense progress and then raise at a higher valuation based on that.

You have to show material progress in the business quickly and that will justify valuation without burning a lot of cash.

How do you think about consolidation in the trucking tech industry?

I think there will absolutely be consolidation in this industry. A lot of people have asked me why there are 18000 freight brokers and almost a million trucking companies in the country. And the reason is there’s no efficiency of scale in this industry because most of the companies are run manually without technology.

They don’t automate the process. They don’t build algorithms that automatically generate the price or workflow automation that makes it so you don’t have to scale linearly with people to do the task. They don’t get more efficient with scale. In fact they get less efficient with scale because they have so much overhead and have had to open dozens of offices around the country to support this massive scale.

When you have systems that use data algorithms and technology to make decisions faster to automate the steps to make it self-service for the users then it can scale in a non-linear way. So that is what Convoy is doing and that’s where the consolidation will happen. It’s a better model and it will grow and take more share.

Is that consolidation or is that just disruption?

I don’t mean consolidation as in mergers and acquisitions. Shippers will start to consolidate their spend. It’s not unusual for a large shipper in this country to work with hundreds or dozens of trucking companies.

What about M&A with other trucking software companies like CloudTrucks or SmartHop?

I think you’re gonna see less of that happening over the next few years because all the new technology-led trucking companies can all scale 100x within the existing market. Instead you’re gonna see hundreds of billions of dollars of freight-spend shift from offline manual ways of doing business — growing linearly with more people — to digital data-led companies that scale non-linearly and have massive advantages at scale and network effects.

Thoughts on going public?

I guess I’m glad that our plan was not to go public right now. I think it’s a good thing for our business to fully realize the potential of the company. I don’t feel pressure to do it and I feel less urgency to do it now that I see where the markets are going.

When you start a company it’s probably impossible to find a work-life balance. Have you found it easier now that you’re further along in the startup journey?

When I started the company I was a bit older; I had two kids. It was something I put a lot of energy into but I wasn’t willing to compromise on my life completely. I like my family. I have friends. I like being active. I coach my daughter’s basketball team.

So when I started I made some promises. I promised my daughters when you’re 10 14 and 18 I promise I’ll take you on a one-week daddy-daughter trip anywhere you want to go in the United States your first time anywhere in the Americas your second time and anywhere in the world your third time.

I work hard and it has definitely gotten a little easier but I just went into this with the knowledge that there would be some things I would have to compromise on but not work and family. I talked to another CEO who said he won’t travel for more than two nights if he can help it and I was like I’m adopting that one.

You’ve got to just write down your limits and boundaries around what you’re gonna do how many nights a week you’ll be home and then you build your world around that.

Where do you expect Convoy to be in a year?

In the next year the way Convoy has changed the industry is going to become a lot more mainstream. The industry is going to contract differently. Brokers are going to think about digital capacity and how they get access to that; they’re going to be comfortable using a platform like Convoy for that.

I think we’re going to become much more of a platform. The approach we’ve taken for doing annual RFPs building a universal shareable trailer pool building an open platform for other brokers to run on the Convoy platform our transparent contracting system — all of those AI platforms that can scale are going to become more mainstream and we’re going to see the industry be more transparent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS1iZXlvbmQtbWVhdC1zdG9jay1wbGFudC1iYXNlZC1ib29tLXVuZGVycGVyZm9ybWluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fake meat was touted as the 'future of food.' Why did it fail to deliver?,"Open this photo in gallery: Photo illustration by Gab Bois/The Globe and Mail

Late last year Michael McCain was on a webcast with Maple Leaf Foods Inc. MFI-T shareholders delivering the previous quarter’s financial results. The news wasn’t great.

The company’s meat-protein business had performed well – revenue had grown by 13 per cent. But growth in the plant-protein division “had evaporated” he said. Sales were down by 6 per cent instead of projected growth of 30 per cent.

After several years of proselytizing about “meat” made from plants – doubling down on the business then doubling down again – Mr. McCain now said Maple Leaf would “reassess” its investment.

It was a remarkable shift.

More than any other Canadian company Maple Leaf – and Mr. McCain in particular – had for years been adamant about their belief in plant-based protein. To hear the company’s long-time chief executive describe it the investment was more than just a business decision. It was the future of food and a key part of Maple Leaf’s long-term plan. The company had long touted its goal of being the world’s most sustainable protein company and had made huge strides in that direction. Sustainability Mr. McCain insisted was an ethical and moral imperative.

It was an unusual message for a meat company. Meat production – which accounted for more than 96 per cent of Maple Leaf’s $4.5-billion in revenue last year – is to blame for as much as one-third of human-caused greenhouse gases. Beef in particular requires an extraordinary amount of land and water to produce and releases high levels of methane a greenhouse gas that’s 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

And over the past six decades global meat production has quadrupled. At current consumption rates and with a rapidly growing global population projected to reach almost 10 billion by 2050 the meat business is unsustainable.

Not too long ago plant-based proteins and other “meat analogues” seemed like an ideal solution to both feed an exploding population and avoid the worst effects of climate change. They were touted by Mr. McCain and others as a perfect compromise between sustainability and our continuing love for meat (or at least meat-like products). Maple Leaf spent US$260-million acquiring various “meat from plant” brands and promised to spend another US$310-million to build a huge plant-based-protein facility in Indiana.

Other huge companies jumped into the market including Cargill Tyson TSN-N and JBS. Bill Gates Li Ka-Shing and other big-name investors poured in billions too. Impossible Foods – whose slogan is “Eat meat save the planet” – has raised US$2.1-billion in funding since its founding in 2011. When Beyond Meat BYND-Q went public in May 2019 it was valued at US$3.7-billion; within months its shares had increased ten-fold. Fast-food chains such as McDonald’s KFC Taco Bell and A&W raced to partner with alternative-meat companies.

It wasn’t just investors who were hyped. Impossible whose soy-based burger includes an ingredient that “bleeds” like rare beef won a 2019 United Nations Global Climate Action Award. Its biochemist CEO Patrick Brown claimed the company’s product was a step toward solving everything from global food insecurity to climate change and even geopolitical conflict by reducing fighting over water and land. “Meat” from plants Impossible boasted was a win-win-win.

But by 2021 the “future of food” had failed to deliver on its own hype. In Canada which saw a 34-per-cent jump in plant-based sales in 2020 growth slowed to 7 per cent. In the United States sales growth plunged from 46 per cent to zero. At Maple Leaf annual sales dropped by 4.7 per cent spurring the company’s “reassessment.”

When asked what went wrong during a video interview in mid-May six months after that shareholder call Mr. McCain pauses.

“We did that deep dive basically to understand the question: Why?”

There was no single answer either he says. And the plant-based market is far from dead. The Swiss bank UBS projects sales to rise to US$51-billion by 2025 a three-fold increase from 2019. Impossible Foods has maintained exceptional growth reporting an 85-per-cent jump in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021.

But as with any hugely hyped new product it’s going through some growing pains both with consumer and investors.

Until the question on plant-based protein Mr. McCain had looked lighter than he had in a long while. Just weeks earlier he’d announced he was stepping down as CEO after 27 years and taking on the role of executive chairman where he’ll spend more time steering the company’s sustainability agenda.

He was silent for a few moments before summing up the company’s deep dive – and what they’d heard from customers – in two words: “Expensive novelty.”

At the start of 2020 Beyond Meat was facing what seemed like a promising year.

Despite a rocky 2019 the U.S.-based company best known for its pea-based “beef” had just announced a new agreement with its pea-protein supplier that would significantly increase its production capabilities. And it had big expansion plans in the works including new partnerships with Subway and Denny’s.

Then came the pandemic.

The company which had relied heavily on deals with major restaurant chains (including A&W in Canada) suddenly had to shift gears. With lockdowns spreading Beyond Meat found itself scrambling to divert finished products away from restaurants and onto retail shelves.

In a call with investors Beyond Meat officials described how they rushed to retrieve products out of storage transport them back to their manufacturing plants and repackage them for retail. They also had to dispose of the old packaging. All of this cost US$6-million. To further complicate matters they ran out of the paper and plastic in which they sold their faux beef which was in short supply.

A similar story unfolded across the industry.

For plant-based food companies big and small the pandemic created a myriad of challenges: lockdowns restaurant closings labour disruptions and supply shortages. Worldwide logistics snarls meant major food-ingredient companies and distributors couldn’t keep up with orders.

“If you can imagine” Mr. McCain told investors in a separate shareholder call “trying to operate a business with a third of your people missing one day half of your ingredient supply not showing up the next and suppliers jacking the price by 15 per cent of another set of ingredients the next day all repeating itself over and over and over.”

Enhanced sanitization distancing protocols and other workplace safety measures at the food manufacturing facilities themselves contributed to massive backlogs and shortages. Installing safety features at Maple Leaf’s many facilities – both meat and plant-based – including separation measures screening areas and protective equipment cost the company tens of millions of dollars Mr. McCain said.

Exacerbating matters was the severe drought last year across the Prairies which threatened access to some of the most important ingredients for many plant-based products: peas and pulses. Canada reported a 45-per-cent drop in yellow-pea production for the year – a common ingredient in many plant-based meats.

Some companies including Beyond Meat weren’t able to regain their footing – they’ve continued to deal with widespread product and shipping delays. The company reported a net loss of US$182-million in 2021.

Such startups were particularly vulnerable because of their position “as an emerging industry that is largely not operating at scale or with the purchasing power of more developed categories” according to a report from Good Food Institute which promotes meat alternatives.

For Kamil Chatila-Amos and Jane Ong the founders of the Montreal-based Neophyto Foods the pandemic pushed them into a whole new business.

They’d launched just months earlier as a vegan cheese company selling direct to restaurants all of which had suddenly shut down. If they wanted to shift to direct-to-consumer sales cheese wouldn’t work. They product had to be shelf stable so they could ship it by regular mail.

So Neophyto relaunched as a purveyor of dehydrated plant-based ground beef made from a mix of soy and pea protein. Customers would rehydrate the mixture in their own kitchen by adding oil and water.

Since then it’s been an uphill battle. The startup began selling its product online then moved to grocery stores – but only briefly. “A big thing we realized is that it’s expensive to be in retail stores” Mr. Chatila-Amos says.

As restaurants began opening up again they’ve slowly built their client base there too.

“It’s very old school – it’s cold-calling” he says. After many months and hundreds of calls he says they’ve landed a “couple tens” of restaurant clients.

In an increasingly crowded competitive market startups like Neophyto are at a disadvantage on almost every measure especially compared with the big players: manufacturing capabilities marketing and the deep pockets that allow larger competitors to absorb huge losses on a product with low margins.

“Five years ago I’d have said this was a new industry” Mr. Chatila-Amos says. “Whereas now it’s absolutely dominated by the big players in the meat and dairy industry.”

Indeed smaller startups around the world have been snapped up by giants such as JBS Tyson WH Group and Maple Leaf.

Others – those that don’t have the backing of large investors – either struggle to gain traction or simply fizzle out.

The entire episode shows all the classic signs of a product life cycle topping out according to Kevin Grier a livestock industry analyst. “And if I’m right about where we’re at” he says “then all of [the remaining players] are going to have to fight for the pie that’s no longer exploding.”

He predicts the market will continue to soften leading to further consolidation price-cutting and tough competition.

But this consolidation in the hands of Big Meat is spurring a growing debate. For many the solution to climate change requires deep systemic transformation of the food system – not just what companies are producing but how they’re produced and by whom.

Last month the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems an independent group comprised of scientists economists and others involved in food-system research released a report subtitled Fake Meat Will Not Save the Planet.

The report argues that many of the companies now acquiring plant-based brands are the same ones responsible for the harmful practices now deeply entrenched in the food system – environmental degradation exploitative labour systems agricultural monocultures and other unsustainable practices.

“These firms got to be extremely large and extremely powerful by doing whatever it takes to be large and powerful” says the report’s lead author Phil Howard a professor of food and community sustainability at Michigan State University.

In particular the report takes aim at the claim that plant-based proteins are the silver bullet to fixing the food system.

One of the most widely discussed criticisms are the purported health benefits. Many meat-from-plants products contain high levels of sodium and saturated fat and fall under the category of “ultra-processed” which Canada’s Food Guide – and nutritionists across the board – warn consumers to limit their intake of.

They also reinforce “centre-of-the-plate dietary patterns” says Prof. Howard – simply replacing meat with meat substitutes as opposed to diversifying the entire diet.

The report also questions the sustainability claims of some plant-based-protein companies. Impossible Burger for instance claims its patty requires 87 per cent less water and 96 per cent less land and produces 89 per cent fewer greenhouse gases than conventional beef.

But the vast majority of existing research on such claims the IPES report says comes from the companies themselves making them difficult to substantiate. The independent research that does exist meanwhile shows a high degree of variability dependent largely on the kind of alternative protein used (soy and wheat for instance have a much larger environmental impact than lupin a bean that’s growing in popularity among vegans) and where it comes from. Coconut for one – used by both Beyond Meat and Maple Leaf – is associated with deforestation.

Most importantly says Prof. Howard plant-based companies typically compare their products with the worst offenders – namely industrial beef producers. This fails to take into account the fact that other methods of meat production can have a much smaller environmental footprint he says. Poultry production for example generates a fraction of the GHG emissions of beef. And smaller-scale operations tend to have smaller footprints than industrial-scale ones.

Mr. Chatila-Amos for his part admits plant-based foods might not be a silver bullet for climate change but he’s quick to add “They’re a part of a solution.”

Small actions he says can result in big changes. But big changes are needed too – not just from major producers but also governments and policy makers.

“It comes with harder systemic change to our greater economy our industry and as a country” he says. “You can’t ask people individually to stop climate change.”

Paul Uys a former member of the IPES panel who spent more than four decades in the food industry including 25 years leading product development at Loblaw echoes this.

“There isn’t one silver bullet unfortunately. The broader silver bullet is: How do we get a more diverse sustainable food production system?” Mr. Uys says. Instead of focusing on one product or solution he says real change will require many steps at every level.

For that matter Mr. Uys adds separate solutions will be required to address the very different challenges faced by different regions – between developing and developed countries and the global north and south.

“We need machine guns with many silver bullets.”

Back at Maple Leaf Mr. McCain breaks down the findings of the company’s reassessment. He’s careful to specify the analysis refers to the entire category not just Maple Leaf’s products.

The results weren’t encouraging – at least in the short term.

At first he says plant-based products enjoyed what he calls a “hyperactive level of trial” induced in part by social-media buzz. “That trial failed to convert consumers to repeat buyers” Mr. McCain says. “High level of trial very low levels of repeat behaviour.”

There were many reasons for this.

The first and one of the most problematic was cost. Even with meat prices on the rise – the cost of meat spiked by almost 10 per cent from 2020 to 2021 – the most popular plant-based beef substitutes typically sell for double the price of the real thing or about $3.50 per 100 grams compared with $1.50. And at a time when food inflation is at an all-time high price is for many families the only factor. (Impossible Foods for one has made several efforts in the past year to reduce prices saying it will continue to do so until it undercuts meat.)

Another reason was that many customers just didn’t like the products very much. “They didn’t feel the taste experience was satisfactory” says Mr. McCain adding this was particularly apparent when it came to choosing foods the whole family could enjoy.

Sylvain Charlebois director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University agrees. “At the very beginning of the plant-based hype there were a lot of products that were launched that weren’t very good” he says. “I think it really impacted how consumers saw the category.”

There was also Mr. McCain said “the realization that sustainability – while important to most of us – was not a purchase motivator.”

So Maple Leaf is going back to the drawing board and adjusting its business model once again.

“With a moderated contracted projection of the market size” says Mr. McCain “we have to and are in the process of adjusting our investment rate.”

That $310-million plant the company had planned to build in Indiana will be dramatically scaled down and focus solely on producing tempeh. All other products will be produced in the existing supply chain or at Maple Leaf meat plants.

Does Mr. McCain still believe in meat from plants? He says yes but with dialled-back expectations for steady but moderate growth.

In the meantime his mission remains pushing the importance of sustainability as a motivator for Maple Leaf and its 13000-plus employees – a way to feel purposeful.

He reflects on a lecture he delivered to business students last year when he was asked whether the meat industry could ever truly be sustainable. “That’s the existential question” he told the class. “Does our industry have a right to exist?”

“It’s a normal human question that we ask ourselves” he says now. “Why do we do what we do?”

Ultimately Maple Leaf is a meat company and will be for the foreseeable future until plant-based proteins truly start to live up to their potential. And so the problem of sustainability in the meat industry says Mr. McCain must be addressed.

“That’s what we’re working on” he says. He’s excited about the potential for technologies such as anaerobic digestion which converts manure into renewable energy and regenerative agriculture – farming practices designed to draw carbon out of the atmosphere and rebuild organic matter in soil. He hopes to see a future where the company is not only carbon-neutral – a milestone Maple Leaf hit three years ago – but carbon-negative.

The push into plant-based he says was aligned with that sustainability goal. But he says it’s only a small part of Maple Leaf’s larger vision.

“We weren’t in that business to further our sustainability agenda” he says. “It was aligned with our objectives.”

“But it was a business decision.”

Earlier this month a report detailed that Hangar 13 is working on a new Mafia game this time a prequel and that multiple big departures had taken place at the company. Studio head Haden Blackman was one of them alongside chief operating officer Matthew Urban. Now after already having received two sets of layoffs in 2017 and 2018 the studio has gone through further layoffs as reported by Kotaku.

According to the report layoffs have occurred at all three sites across the world with almost 50 losing their jobs at Hangar 13's Novato California office. ""I know it sucks"" said Nick Baynes Blackman's replacement and head of the Brighton UK office in a staff meeting earlier this week.

""I’m sorry I’m not over there to deliver this message. I will be coming over soon. I know you need some local leadership and structure and we’re working on it.""

The Novato office currently has 87 members of staff meaning there will only be around 37 members of staff left after the cut according to Kotaku's source familiar with the decision. Mafia 3 launched in 2016 and at the time Novato apparently had over 100 full-time employees.

2K confirmed the layoffs in a statement provided to Kotaku but provided no further comment. ""2K is fully committed to the future of Hangar 13 as the studio navigates a challenging but ultimately promising transition period. As part of our ongoing evaluations to ensure our resources are aligned with our goals we have made some changes that have resulted in a reduction of positions and parting ways with some colleagues.""

Hangar 13 will reportedly continue to work on the prequel game supposedly being developed in Unreal Engine 5 as well as tennis games. But the studio has struggled since the launch of Mafia 3 and Kotaku's report claims that parent company Take-Two has treated Hangar 13 like an ""in-source studio"" using it to assist on games like Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and Marvel's Midnight Suns.

Baynes has apparently said that anyone still at the company will be safe from further layoffs but considering the last few years it would be understandable if staff had concerns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9jcmVhdGUtYW4taW50ZXJhY3RpdmUtd2ViLWFwcC13aXRoLXB5c2NyaXB0LWFuZC1wYW5kYXMtMzkxOGFkMmRhZGEx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Create an Interactive Web App with PyScript and Pandas,"Create an Interactive Web App with PyScript and Pandas

Brandon gave it the number one spot on his list of the best retro game consoles of all time and I got into modifying them in early 2021.

Yes we have had giant leaps in technology since its release and we have found some ways to cram new tech into the handheld that push it to its limits.

But it is still important to remember that Nintendo designed these gems to do one thing… play simple and fun games on the go.

Of course even Nintendo (and game developers under publishing license) started to look into new and creative ways to expand on the console.

We made a list of the 15 Best Gameboy Accessories To Pimp Your Handheld…

But it was features like the “Rumble Pak” that expanded the functionality tied directly to your game play.



The Rumble Pak functionality was a feature built right into the game cartridge allowing a vibration response to game play.

This feature continued into the Nintendo 64 and the Nintendo DS as well.

10. Ready To Rumble Boxing

You ever want to know what it feels like to get punched right in the face without having to do it in real life?

Well we can’t say that the vibration function in Ready To Rumble Boxing will be anything close to that… but it sure is a fun time.

Feel the response of every hit as you battle your way through this Game Boy Color port of the classic game franchise.

Not the best game you will play not the second best either. But certainly worth a go especially if you are a fan of vibration.

9. Zebco Fishing

image credit: vatical

Where this game differs from others on our list is that Zebco Fishing actually requires the use of the Rumble Pak to achieve your goal.

Your fishing experience takes place from a top down perspective where you navigate your boat to the desired fishing location and cast your line.

It is the vibration from the Rumble Pak that indicates when you have hooked your target and it is time to reel it in!

It’s a fun time for fans of fishing and tough to ignore when making a list of the best Rumble Pak games.

8. Vigilante 8

image credit: vatical

Take a bunch of different cars and throw them in a demolition derby with guns and you got yourself a pretty intense experience.

And Vigilante 8 certainly gave us a pretty unique game to experience.

With the inclusion of the Ruble Pak you can feel every bump crash and gun shot like you were there for reals.

For fans of the older Grand Theft Auto games or titles like Twisted Metal.

7. Polaris Snowcross

image credit: vatical

Polaris Snowcross features some of the smoothest racing mechanics to come to the Game Boy Color.

And with the addition of the Rumble Pak vibration response the game feels that much more alive.

With some sweet jumps and some annoying obstacles you have all that much more reason to play it safe.

Or if you enjoy that vibration… go ahead.. crash into everything!

6. The Little Mermaid 2 – Pinball Frenzy

image credit: disney

I don’t know if The Little Mermaid and pinball sound exciting to you…

But let me tell you from experience this game is a blast.

This one plays out much like you’d expect… all of the vibration response you can handle in a fun pinball package.

But with the additional sixteen mini-games offered Left Field Productions gave us more than we even asked for.

It is these mini-games that really made the experience totally worth the investment.

And for fans of the Rumble Pak on Game Boy Color this one is a must-try.

5. Top Gear Pocket

image credit: kemco

I am a big fan of these kinds of third person racing games.

Top Gear Pocket offers a visually stunning racing experience with all of the road response you would hope for in a game that uses the Rumble Pak.

With a wide variety of tracks elevation changes smooth game play mechanics and some of the most vibrant graphics on the Game Boy Color this game really has a lot going for it.

As the very first game to feature the Rumble Pak for the Game Boy Color it also holds an important place in the history of handheld gaming.

An easy addition to our list of the best Rumble Pak games and one you should check out asap.

4. Star Wars Episode 1 Racer

image credit: lucas films

Star Wars Episode 1 Racer on the Nintendo 64 is a classic. And a lot to live up to for any port.

So when we got a Rumble Pak version on the Game Boy Color we had high expectations.

What did we expect? Super fast paced racing on a wide variety of tracks with a ton of character.

And while this Game Boy title may be missing that character it surely got the fast racing action and variety in racing environments we would hope for.

The game play is presented in a unique top down perspective and is sooooo fast.

Every bump and crash will be felt and add to the anxiety you will feel at every turn.

So don’t crash. Or like we said before… do. Either way it’s gonna be fun.

3. Legend of the River King 2

image credit: natsume

A fishing RPG for the Game Boy?

Now that’s something you probably didn’t expect to hear.

But this Japanese-only release is an absolute classic for hardcore fans.

And we can see why.

With its cute aesthetic and a charming storyline this game is sure to tug at your heartstrings (or fishing lines!).

Of course if you want to play the original (with the Rumble Pak) you will need to have some basic Japanese in your skillset.

But with English releases in North American and Europe that came a couple years after the original you can still enjoy this amazing title… you just wont be able to feel that sweet vibration.

A great game to check out in any case and especially if you can get your hands on the original Rumble Pak version.

2. Perfect Dark

image credit: rare

Besides the fact that this game has some interesting graphics for the Game Boy Color…

It is also pretty cool to actually feel your shots when runnin-n-gunnin your way through this Game Boy port.

I said “interesting” graphics not “good” graphics. Ha. While they are quite advanced for the time I don’t think they aged so well.

But in 2000 I wouldn’t say that most game devs were intending their Game Boy ports to be the shining achievement.

That being said.. Rare certainly tried to give us something quite unique interesting advanced and even game us a rumble feature to make it that much more appealing.

With top down game play sniper mode puzzles and even racing sequences we certainly have a lot to work with here.

A+ for effort. Silver medal for our list.

1. Pokémon Pinball

We are huge fans of both Pokémon and pinball games for the Game Boy.

And when you got a Pokémon themed pinball game with a Rumble Pak… now we’re talking!!!

Pokémon Pinball plays out exactly as you might expect…

A super fun pinball experience a ton of variety in rooms and vibration response on impact.

It is the additional feature of Pokémon catching that make this pinball game quite unique.

Pokémon Pinball was even one of the best selling Game Boy Color titles of all time.

An obvious pick for Pokémon fans for fun Game Boy Titles and absolutely the best experience for games that make use of the Rumble Pak.",,,,,,

In Victoria protesters attempting to prevent native forest logging would face 12 months’ jail or more than $21000 in fines and bans from protest areas under laws proposed last week by the Andrews Labor government.

In Tasmania protesters could be fined up to $12975 or jailed for 18 months for a first offence and organisations up to $103800 if they were judged to have obstructed workers or caused “a serious risk”.

The changes introduced by the Rockliff Liberal government passed the state’s lower house with support from the Labor opposition.

In both cases the governments said new laws were necessary to protect workers’ safety and in the case of the Tasmanian laws to protect business interests. Both denied they were attacking the right to protest or free speech but groups from across civil society described the changes as disproportionate and undemocratic.

Kieran Pender a senior lawyer with the Human Rights Law Centre (and an occasional Guardian contributor) said the laws were part of an alarming national trend of undemocratic infringements on protest rights.

They followed the New South Wales parliament last month passing a bill that introduced penalties of up to two years’ jail for protesters who blocked roads ports or rail he said.

“The right to protest is a core democratic value that must be protected” Pender said.

Victoria’s surprise penalties

The Victorian legislation surprised observers when introduced. In a joint statement the Human Rights Law Centre and Environmental Justice Australia urged the Andrews government to withdraw it and accused it of undermining the freedom to protest “in order to shield business profits”.

The introduction of the legislation follows the government announcing in 2019 that it would phase out native forest logging by 2030 and several legal cases being brought against the state-owned logging agency VicForests over alleged logging breaches.

Ellen Maybery a senior lawyer with Environmental Justice Australia said the proposed new criminal penalties were “harsh” and a “politically motivated crackdown on legitimate political expression” ahead of the November state election.

“Our climate and vital ecosystems are collapsing before our eyes and people who understand this cannot stay silent” she said.

A Victorian government spokesperson said forest protests in the state had increased and accused campaigners of using “dangerous new tactics” that created an unacceptable risk to the safety of workers police officers and the protesters themselves.

“There have been instances of protesters blocking heavy working machinery locking on to machinery tethering tree sits to machinery and standing under idle machinery” the spokesperson said. “Forestry workers like other workers are entitled to be mentally and physically safe as they go about their work regardless of how people may view that work.”

Gemma Cafarella a barrister and spokesperson for Liberty Victoria said no evidence had been presented to back up the claim that there was a threat to workers’ safety or that existing laws which include penalties of more than $3000 were not working.

The Victorian Greens environment spokeswoman Ellen Sandell said the government had not provided examples and accused Labor of doing everything it could to remove barriers to native timber logging.

Tasmania’s fourth attempt

In Tasmania it is the Liberal government’s fourth attempt to introduce tougher anti-protest laws since being elected in 2014. Earlier bids were thrown out by the high court or failed to pass the upper house.

Ahead of the parliamentary debate 12 civil society groups in an open letter in the Hobart Mercury called on MPs to protect the state’s “long and proud history of peaceful protest” which they said included campaigns to decriminalise homosexuality protect the Franklin River and fight for better working conditions.

“The Tasmanian government’s claim that it will not put in place anything that will limit lawful protesting is simply not true when these anti-democratic anti-protest laws do just that” the groups including Anglicare TasCOSS Amnesty International and Equality Tasmania said.

Welcoming the bill passing the lower house with Labor support on Wednesday Tasmania’s resources minister Guy Barnett said the state government had “listened to the needs of business”.

“It costs money it creates risk and it can cause stress for the workers. In some cases there is potential for physical harm” he said.

Barnett said the government respected Tasmanians’ right to free speech and the laws would not limit lawful protesting.

The inclusion of a clause that targets “body corporates” – organisations – has been interpreted to be specifically aimed at the Bob Brown Foundation which has protested against logging in native forest logging coupes and drilling by mining company MMG in the Tarkine rainforest where the company is planning to build a pipeline and waste storage facility.

Jenny Weber the Bob Brown Foundation’s campaign manager said the group would not back down. She said claims its protesters had put workers at risk were untrue.

“Tasmania police are well aware that our protesters are trained in nonviolent direct action and use de-escalation techniques to maintain safety in our protests” she said. “None of these tactics has had safety impacts on workers.”

The Greens MP Rosalie Woodruff said the changes were an “attack on democracy” and it was “tragic” that Labor had supported the legislation after failing to amend it.

A Labor spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. The bill will come before the upper house later this year.

In 2017 the former Australian Greens leader Bob Brown won a landmark court case against an earlier version of Tasmania’s anti-protest laws. The high court judged the laws directly targeted implied freedom of political expression in the constitution and were unconstitutional.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU4ODM2My9jaGluYS1uaWRlYy1mYWN0b3J5LTFtaWxsaW9uLWVheGxlLWFubnVhbGx5L9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU4ODM2My9jaGluYS1uaWRlYy1mYWN0b3J5LTFtaWxsaW9uLWVheGxlLWFubnVhbGx5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China: Nidec Will Build A Huge Factory For 1 Million E-Axles Annually,"Nidec a major Japanese electric motor manufacturer announced a decision to build a new flagship factory for EV traction motor system in he city of Pinghu Zhejiang Province in China.

It will be a pretty large facility that's designed for 1 million E-Axle (traction motor system) and related products (including inverters and gears) annually.

Construction work is scheduled to start in October while production is expected to start a year later in October 2023. Full scale production is expected in FY2024 (in fiscal year ending on March 31 2025).

The company notes that the new flagship site will be its fifth traction motor-related production site and the fourth E-Axle assembly plant in China.

Combined with other plants Nidec would like to sell 3.6 million E-Axle in the fiscal year 2025 while the production capacity at this point will head 7 million units.

Those are quite ambitious plans and forecasts which would make Nidec potentially the biggest player in the electric car's traction motor market.

The company introduced its first E-Axle models in 2019 and since then sold over 370000 units cumulatively.

""As Nidec aims to achieve its 2030 sales target of 10 trillion yen its automotive business the traction motor business in particular plays a pivotal role in the effort. We have sold a total of more than 370000 units of E-Axel the traction motor system that Nidec started producing in April 2019 as the first company to do so in the world.""

The expansions of the business progresses not only in China but also in Europe where Nidec partners with Stellantis and recently announced a new plant in Serbia.

The lineup of Nidec's E-axles consist five models (50 kW 70 kW 100 kW 150 kW and 200 kW) and are used in more than 10 new models in China alone as well as in scooters.

Russia’s Most Advanced Weapons Are Shockingly Packed With ‘American Components’ — Ukrainian Intelligence,"Ukraine has revealed the use of US-made microchips in the Russian military hardware thereby raising questions about Moscow’s ability to produce the technological components.

When the Ukrainian military started dismantling Russian weapons many pieces of captured or partially destroyed equipment had an abundant use of foreign microchips particularly those manufactured in the US.

According to the list of components shared by Ukrainian Intelligence with The War Zone Ua US defense portal the chips were found inside a recovered example of the 9S932-1 a radar-equipped air defense command post vehicle that is part of the larger Barnaul-T system a Pantsir air defense system a Ka-52 “Alligator” attack helicopter and a Kh-101 (AS-23A Kodiak) cruise missile.

List Of Components

Barnaul-T is Russia’s most high-end air defense command and control subsystem within the larger integrated system for air defense of the Russian Army Marine units and Airborne forces.

The 9S932-1 is a radar-equipped reconnaissance/control module of the Barnaul-T subsystem which conducts round-the-clock reconnaissance and exercises command and control of subordinate troops and their armaments in warfare on combat positions.

This module is directly linked to units equipped with various Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) Systems including Tor-M-series (SA-15) and 9K35 Strela (SA-13) surface-to-air missile systems 9K33 Osa (SA-8) wheeled surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems 2K22 Tunguska (SA-19) tracked air defense systems and 9K333 Verba (SA-25) MANPAD systems.

The Ukrainian Intelligence said they found eight micro-chips in the communications systems of the 9S932-1 module sourced from US manufacturers like Intel Micrel Micron Technology and Atmel Corp.

The Pantsir air defense system is a well-known medium-range SAM and an anti-aircraft artillery system. The Ukrainian specialists reportedly found five US-made chips – manufactured by AMD Rochester Electronics Texas Instruments and Linear Technology – inside the direction finder of this air defense system.

The Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM) have been in the news for their unexpectedly high rate of failure in long-range attacks against Ukrainian targets. In the words of a US Defense official during a briefing in March “either they’re failing to launch or they’re failing to hit the target or they’re failing to explode on contact”.

In addition to the reportedly high failure rates the Kh-101 also appears to be heavily dependent on foreign-made chips as the Ukrainian intelligence claimed to have found at least 35 US-made chips including those manufactured by Texas Instruments Atmel Corp.

The Ukrainian military claims that the guidance systems and electronics recovered from Russian Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles used in Ukraine were developed in the 1960-1970s. https://t.co/XF0lEM3jdH pic.twitter.com/4XTaWCO0WS — Rob Lee (@RALee85) April 22 2022

The high rate of failures and latest findings of such heavy dependence on foreign chips in Kh-101 ALCM should be concerning for Moscow as the missile’s Kh-102 variant is the Russian Air Force’s main air-launched nuclear-armed cruise missile.

Coming to the Ka-52 Alligator Russia’s twin-seat all-weather attack helicopter the Ukrainian specialists opened up its turreted electro-optical system in which they found 22 US-made chips and one Korean-made chip.

The US manufacturers included Texas Instruments IDT Altera USA Burr-Brown Analog Devices Inc. Micron Technology Linear Technology and TE Connectivity.

Chips Not Necessarily Sourced From Manufacturers

These chips may not have necessarily been sourced directly from the manufacturers as there is a massive and unregulated market for recycled chips emerging from China which could be a more likely source of these chips as many of them appear to be quite old according to Ukrainian specialists.

Also as reported earlier by EurAsian Times researchers in the UK revealed in April that Russia has been sourcing British-made dual-use components such as electronic chips and switchboards for its weaponry through intermediary businesses in India and China.

Earlier this month Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo who recently met Ukraine’s Prime Minister said during a Senate hearing “We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground it’s filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators.”

Components found in weapon systems are difficult to prevent from falling into the wrong hands but experts say that the US officials do have the authority to prevent shipments of such dual-use chips.

NATO Members Arming Russia?

The news comes after an astounding revelation in late April that how NATO members had used the ‘Grandfather Clause’ to bypass the EU embargo on Moscow.

According to an EU report at least ten NATO member states exported around €350 million ($378.6 million) in military hardware to Vladimir Putin’s regime out of which German and French companies accounted for 78 percent with €273 million ($295.4 million) worth of military export.

Despite an EU-wide embargo on arms supplies to Russia after the latter annexed Crimea in 2014 Germany and France delivered bombs rockets missiles and guns to Moscow.

In addition the French companies also delivered thermal imaging cameras as well as navigation systems for fighter aircraft attack helicopters and Russian tanks.

These member states took advantage of a loophole that allowed contracts signed before August 1 2014 or subsequent contracts that would help close those agreements to continue.

That said the latest findings have exposed the heavy dependence of Russian war machines on western technology in key sensitive areas such as targeting navigation communications and control systems of the weapons which could be deeply unsettling for Moscow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FnYWRnZXQuY29tL2VuLzEzNDUwOC1hbWVyaWNhbi1taWNyb2NoaXBzLWZvdW5kLWluLWNhcHR1cmVkLXJ1c3NpYW4tbWlsaXRhcnktZXF1aXBtZW50LWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS_SAXFodHRwczovL2dhZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9lbi8xMzQ1MDgtYW1lcmljYW4tbWljcm9jaGlwcy1mb3VuZC1pbi1jYXB0dXJlZC1ydXNzaWFuLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWVxdWlwbWVudC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American microchips found in captured Russian military equipment - intelligence,Not only Fallout: 7 series based on the plot of computer games that are also worthy of attention,,,,,,,,,

According to a source familiar with the matter Tesla plans to eliminate referral links which owners often spam on social media and instead turn to an app-based referral program promoting in-person referrals.

A few months later Tesla ended its referral program for everything except its solar roof.

The company has yet to launch a new version of its referral program for electric vehicles. We don’t expect it to come for a while as the company still has a massive backlog of orders resulting in being production constrained for the foreseeable future.

But in the meantime it has been tweaking the referral program for solar products. While it was only for solar roof installations at first Tesla added solar panel installation back to its referral program with a $300 award per installation late last year.

Now Tesla is reducing the $500 reward for solar roof referrals to match the reward for solar panel installations.

The automaker updated the language on its referral program support page:

Friends and family who order through your referral link can earn $300 for Solar Roof or Solar Panels upon permission to operate while also reducing reliance on the grid and producing clean solar energy. You will earn $300 for each Solar Roof or Solar Panels referral.

Tesla has been known to not always pay out its awards from the referral programs. Most famously it has yet to deliver on the many Roadsters and Roadster discounts that it had promised buyers for the referral program between 2017 to 2019 a critical time in Tesla’s history. The company has also yet to deliver on some special rewards like sending an image of the referrer’s choice to space on a SpaceX rocket.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9tdXNrLXNheXMtZ2F0ZXMtaGFzLW11bHRpLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLXRlc2xhLXNob3J0LXBvc2l0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Musk says Gates has 'multi-billion dollar' Tesla short position,"Bill Gates has a short position against Tesla Inc. that would now need between $1.5 billion and $2 billion to close out Elon Musk said Friday in a series of tweets.

More than 75% said they had less trust in politicians.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGF0ZXNsYWFwcC5jb20vbmV3cy83NzcvdGVzbGEtcmVzZWFyY2gtZ3JvdXAtc2hvd3MtdGhhdC1uZXctYmF0dGVyeS1jb3VsZC1sYXN0LXVwLXRvLTEwMC15ZWFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla research group shows that new battery could last up to 100 years,"Musk Shares What to Expect in FSD v12.4 Next Week; Talks About Abilities of FSD v12.5 and v12.6 Less than two weeks since its last FSD update Tesla is getting ready to release FSD v12.4 with CEO Elon Musk hinting at significant improvements. The current version 12.3.6 introduced Autopark and High Fidelity Park Assist for vehicles equipped with ultrasonic sensors in the U.S. and Canada along with minor fixes for FSD. Just an hour ago Musk shed some light on Tesla's next FSD update. Through his X account Musk teased the imminent release of v12.4 stating ""Probably start rolling out 12.4 next week."" Moreover he provided insights into the development process and the features users can expect in the upcoming 12.4 version as well as v12.5 and v12.6. What to Expect in FSD v12.4 Musk says that FSD 12.4 has extensive retraining of AI models that particularly focuses on refining the comfort of passengers by addressing concerns around abrupt acceleration or braking. Musk previously commented on the next versions of FSD saying that FSD v12.4 and 12.5 would be major improvements and while v12.4 may be a major step forward it looks like its main focus will be on being more natural and smoother. ""Probably start rolling out 12.4 next week."" FSD v12.5 and v12.6 to Handle More Complex Scenarios Looking ahead Tesla is already laying the groundwork for future updates according to Musk. The CEO previously stated that Tesla is constantly working on FSD updates that are three to six months ahead of what’s in production so they have a good idea of what the software will be able to handle in the future. Today on X Musk said that there's ongoing testing for FSD versions 12.5 and 12.6 which involves tackling complex scenarios. Musk says this includes navigating narrow one-way roads and handling unexpected road closures requiring the vehicle to reverse and find alternate routes. Actually Smart Summon in v12.5? Tesla’s Autopilot lead Ashok Elluswamy previously talked about how FSD would gain the ability to go in reverse when Tesla is ready to release Actually Smart Summon. If the ability to reverse is still tied to some of the abilities of Actually Smart Summon then it’s possible we may see Tesla’s better summon implementation in version 12.5 or 12.6. Vehicles to be Able to Communicate with Fleet Musk also gives us some insight into vehicle communication saying vehicles will need to be able to communicate with the fleet so that you ""don't get a whole bunch of Teslas stuck down a road."" Instead of vehicle-to-vehicle communication Tesla will likely have vehicles report back to the ""mothership"" where Tesla can aggregate data and report it to nearby vehicles. This is similar to how vehicles report traffic today instead of talking directly to each other. Spending on AI Tesla's commitment to advancing its AI capabilities is evident through its substantial investments. Musk recently emphasized the company's dedication to spending around $10 billion throughout 2024 on training and inference AI. Musk said that any company that isn’t spending billions on AI this year just won’t be able to compete. Expansion of FSD Tesla appears ready to start the expansion of FSD and it looks like China may be up first. Musk's recent visit to Beijing to discuss a potential FSD rollout and data sharing shows that Tesla is ready and serious about FSD's expansion. While FSD's rollout in China appears promising Musk remains cautiously optimistic about expanding into other markets. He believes that FSD v12 is ready for supervised FSD in left-hand drive (LHD) countries while right-hand drive (RHD) markets like the UK and Australia may require additional time.

An In-Depth Look at Tesla's New Music Player in Update 2024.14 [Photos & Video] One of the exciting new features of Tesla update 2024.14 is the improved media player for the Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla's media player has gone through some drastic changes over the years but this appears to be the best revision yet. The previous media player had four states... yes four. It made for a confusing experience even for owners who used the car every day. The four states included: The ""default"" state included a small player closest to the driver with some of the most used buttons

The second state was the enlarged view when you dragged up on the media player that revealed additional buttons such as shuffle and search

There was also its minimized state which placed the music player’s icon in the dock and led to confusion

And lastly if you had a music service open fully on the right part of the screen AND minimized the media player then the player would hop over to the top of the larger music panel on the right. It created for an inconsistent experience and all of the players had their downsides. There just wasn’t a solution that worked all of the time. Thankfully the new music player addresses most of these issues. What’s New The first thing Tesla did was reduce the number of states essentially down to two. You have a regular media player and a minimized player. You don't have to drag up on the player to access the shuffle or search functions and you can’t “lose” the player by minimizing it to the dock anymore. One-Tap Access to Shuffle Repeat and Search What Tesla did was move all of the crucial media functions from the previous larger player directly to the main player. This now gives you one-tap access to functions like shuffle repeat search playback speed audio levels and search. Not only were these functions hard to access before but they were hidden underneath the player making discovery for new owners difficult. Improved Progress Bar The progress bar on the previous player was difficult to see since it was just a slim line at the bottom of the player. The new player has a thicker progress bar that separates the top portion of the player which houses the album art song title and a couple of functions and the bottom portion which contains more controls. Tesla also added a circle to the progress bar making it more obvious you can not only scrub through the media but also lets you easily see your current spot. Accessing More Functions Since the larger media player was removed so was some of the functionality that it included. All the important items were moved to the main media player such as audio settings and search however the other functionality such as access to Favorites Sources Recent Songs and Next was moved to the larger music app. If you tap on the new music player it’ll open up the current music app on the right side that includes music controls as well as access to your favorites music sources upcoming songs and more. This is also the only way to view the elapsed and remaining times for the current selection which is useful for longer median such as audiobooks or podcasts. New Minimized Player Although the music player doesn't minimize to the dock it does feature a minimalist version that docks to the bottom of the screen. When you slide down on the audio player it'll be reduced to a simple ""one-line"" player. It simply shows a music icon the name of the title being played and an arrow showing you the player can be made larger. There is no longer a gray music icon that appears in the dock when the player is in its “minimized” state. Modern UI The player itself also looks more modern it now features a translucent background instead of a solid color like before. The new background lets vehicle animations subtly shine through a lot like the effects used on modern operating systems. What Models Will Support It According to Tesla’s social media post on X the ‘Visual updates’ in update 2024.14 are limited to AMD Ryzen-based Model 3 and Model Y vehicles meaning only vehicles manufactured after about 2022+. The exact timeline depends on your vehicle and region but you can check to see which processor your vehicle includes by navigating to Controls > Software > Additional Vehicle Information. New Player in Action [Video] DominicBRNKMN shows off the new music player in action below. Will We See Intel Atom Support? The new music player isn’t doing anything crazy in this latest iteration. We believe we'll see this updated player come to Intel Atom vehicles eventually. The Cybertruck already includes the new media player among the other design changes so when Tesla said only for “Model 3/Y with AMD chip” on X they likely meant in this specific update. There's nothing that’s more computationally intensive about this new player except for maybe the translucent background however that’s already being done on Intel-based vehicles for some of the navigation modules. There isn’t anything new that the slower Intel processor couldn't handle. It’s in Tesla’s best interest to keep a common interface between vehicles. Tesla wouldn't want to drastically change the way a common item like the ""radio"" works between different Model 3 and Model Y years if they didn't have to. That would complicate issues with service and documentation. Tesla wants owners to have the same UI as much as possible so we there’s a good chance that we’ll see the new media player apply to Intel in the future. Hopefully in an upcoming update Intel owners will receive this streamlined music player. Update 2024.14 is currently rolling out slowly to some vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ibG9nLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Rlc2xhLWF1dG9waWxvdC1leHBsYWluZXItbm90LWZ1bGwtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Tesla AutoPilot and is it really Full Self-Driving?,"The world of “self-driving” is rife with all kinds of marketing jargon that contributes to plenty of confusion both for customers and the media. If you believe everything that Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweets we’re all on the verge of being able to simply set our cars for a destination and let them drive us there without having to interfere right? While Musk is a polarizing figure — and despite the technology’s confusing and potentially even misleading name — his AutoPilot system is simply a name for Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system. It is not in fact a fully self-driving system.

It’s also different and separate from Tesla’s more advanced Full Self Driving technology package which itself has a misleading name. Here’s what you need to know in order to understand AutoPilot and what it can and cannot do.

What is ADAS and what does it have to do with AutoPilot?

ADAS stands for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. It’s an automotive industry term that companies use as a catch-all for the technology that helps make driving both safer and more comfortable. ADAS can encompass everything from blind-spot warning and lane departure warning to more advanced systems like adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance. Some ADAS systems are very advanced allowing the driver to remove their feet and hands off the controls while the car is underway (and while ADAS is engaged) and adapt to the speed of traffic around the vehicle without crashing. Others are not nearly as advanced. It really depends on the type of technology included in a vehicle and how successfully it is implemented.

AutoPilot is Tesla’s marketing term for an ADAS system that includes an adaptive cruise system that when active modulates speed and distance based on the traffic road conditions and speed limits on specific mapped roads. It also includes a lane-centering steering assist system that Tesla calls “Autosteer” which helps your vehicle remain in its lane as the road curves and undulates. Other brands offer these types of features.

Most ADAS systems have specific physical parameters that have to be met before the system can be turned on. For example like other adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering systems the sensors around the vehicle must have at least one or two clear lane markings on either side of the car in order to keep the vehicle centered in the lane. Adaptive cruise uses cameras around the vehicle (though older models also featured radar) to maintain a set speed and distance from vehicles ahead and around it.

What is “Self-Driving” and Why Isn’t AutoPilot a Fully-Autonomous Driving System?

This brings us to the topic of “self-driving” and “autonomous vehicles.” These terms are often thrown around by Musk and his fans especially when it comes to claims that Tesla vehicles can drive themselves using AutoPilot. The reality is that there are currently no legal full-self-driving vehicles on the road today no matter what Elon Musk or his marketing department may say.

That’s because autonomous driving is highly regulated and clearly defined by various governing bodies both here in the United States and around the world. To understand why Tesla’s AutoPilot is not a self-driving system you have to first understand how these regulating bodies define self- or autonomous driving.

There are two main governing bodies that help define this stuff: the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (also known as NHTSA) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (also known as SAE). According to these two governing bodies there are six levels of autonomy ranging from Level 0 to Level 5. As you move up each level you essentially remove the need for human interaction from the driving equation. As you move up the scale towards Level 5 you can increasingly withdraw your attention as well as your physical body from the driver’s seat. Here’s how the levels break down:

Level 0: Also known as driving on your own without any assistance whatsoever. You accelerate you steer you brake. It’s just you your car and the laws of physics.

Also known as driving on your own without any assistance whatsoever. You accelerate you steer you brake. It’s just you your car and the laws of physics. Level 1: At Level 1 you get some automation. This means your car is capable of managing simple inputs one at a time. These include things like basic cruise control or lane-departure warning. The first consumer cars to feature cruise control (which ironically enough was called Auto-pilot) came from Chrysler in 1968.

The first consumer cars to feature cruise control (which ironically enough was called Auto-pilot) came from Chrysler in 1968. Level 2: At this level you can use two or more automated systems to drive at the same time. For example that means your cruise control is now pretty smart. You still have to set the speed but once it’s engaged the car can automatically slow down if there’s a car in front or speed up when the coast is clear. It can also pair with lane-keeping assist (makes sure you don’t veer out of your lane) and the more advanced lane-centering steering assist (does much of the steering for you but you need to keep a hand on the wheel). Although AutoPilot is a highly advanced adaptive cruise control even Tesla has admitted that it’s Level 2 system. AutoPilot has come under a lot of fire from NHTSA the FTC and politicians because of the deadly crashes resulting from Musk’s repeated misleading claims that AutoPilot is a fully-autonomous system. GM’s Super Cruise and Ford’s BlueCruise are Level 2 systems.

GM’s Super Cruise and Ford’s BlueCruise are Level 2 systems. Level 3: This is what’s known as conditional automation meaning that if specific conditions are met (like proper lane markings road signs and weather conditions on specific stretches of highway) then the car can do some limited self-driving without any human input – but with the requirement that a human can take over at any time if the system fails to detect the required inputs. The new 2023 Mercedes-Benz S-Class will offer an optional package called DrivePilot which is a real legal conditional Level 3 system.

The new 2023 Mercedes-Benz S-Class will offer an optional package called DrivePilot which is a real legal conditional Level 3 system. Level 4 and Level 5: These two levels are varying degrees of autonomous driving – Level 4 still offers a steering wheel or mechanism for a human to take over while Level 5 deletes the steering wheel controls completely. These two phases are still very far off. There are no Level 4 or Level 5 autonomous vehicles on public roads today.

Only at Level 5 autonomy can you safely hop into the back seat of your car and take a nap or eat a pizza.

AutoPilot Levels

There are currently two levels of AutoPilot that Tesla offers: “Basic AutoPilot” and “Full Self-Driving.”

Basic AutoPilot comes on all Teslas and includes ADAS systems like adaptive cruise lane centering and lane-keeping assistance and emergency braking.

Customers can decide to “upgrade” by paying as much as $12000 to “Full Self-Driving” or FSD. At the FSD level customers get access to systems that can help them “summon” their Tesla from a parking spot (though there have been many incidences of crashes like this Tesla that drove itself into a $3 million private jet while using the system) stop sign control and auto lane change. Tesla rolled out (and then rolled back) an “Assertive” mode for its FSD system which rolled stop signs narrowed the following distance and made some questionable left turns. Tesla was required to remove its Assertive mode because of the risky (and illegal) behavior.

Is AutoPilot a Self-Driving System?

Absolutely not. Tesla’s AutoPilot is a Level 2 system that amounts to a suite of advanced driver safety systems that help make driving a bit less taxing. Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” system is also not a self-driving system since it still requires human input. In case it bears repeating: You should never ever exit the driver’s seat take a nap or take your eyes off the road when using either of these systems as they pose a risk to both your own life and those of the drivers around you. While AutoPilot is a tool that can be used to make driving easier it is not a full self-driving system.

The information comes from Ukrainian intelligence. Some of the Russian weapons systems seized by the Ukrainians since the beginning of the war have been dismantled and the facts have been established.

The chips found in the Russian Kh-101 missile were manufactured by Texas Instruments Atmel Corp. Rochester Electronics Cypress Semiconductor Maxim Integrated XILINX Infineon Technologies Intel Onsemi and Micron Technology. A complete list of used American microchips has been sent to the Pentagon.

Ukrainian intelligence also claims that the Kh-101 is not a precedent. The Russian 9S932-1 a radar-equipped air defense command post vehicle that is part of the larger Barnaul-T system a Pantsir air defense system and the Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopter are also full of US-made chips. The total number of chips found in the listed weapons systems is 35 and together with those of the Kh-101 missile it is clear that in only four weapons systems the Russians have integrated 70 US-made microchips.

So far we do not know how many of Russia’s weapons systems developed in recent decades use US-made microchips but the components of Ukrainian intelligence found in the four weapons cited raise a logical question: Does Russia have the ability to produce critical components and semiconductors?

Despite the sanctions imposed on the Russian economy in recent years [since 2014 after the annexation of Crimea] in some way these chips have gone to Russian weapons developers and designers. There is no evidence of direct sales between the United States and Russia. This market is difficult to regulate: Moscow may have bought the chips from third parties. Another possibility is that these chips were delivered from China as this country is a world leader in chip recycling. However there are two other possibilities: someone has violated the provisions of the imposed economic sanctions or the chips are simply not military.

Experts in the United States [such as Skip Parish] are already saying that Western Western technology in Russian weapons speaks to two main things: “Russia’s dependence on Western technology” and “US failure or non-existent control of international arms trafficking rules.”

Let’s look at the situation with the Kh-101 stealth attack cruise missile. The two photos below show only part of the 35 microchips found in the rocket. Experts from BulgarianMilitary.com found that they look like microchips produced in the ’60s and ’70s in the United States. This confirms one of the supposed possibilities i.e. opportunity for recycled chips from China.

A Ukrainian expert says the chips used in the Kh-101 stealth attack cruise missile may not have been recycled in China but in the former Soviet-era plant the Voronezh Radio Parts Plant the Minsk Plant or the Integral Plant.

Phoot: Twitter

There is evidence that a significant number of Kh-101 missiles fired on the territory of Ukraine do not hit the targets which again raises the question: how old are the US-made chips discovered and how effective combined with Russian technology?

Microchips from the American company Onsemi have been found in some of Russia’s weapons systems. However the company is not responsible for this as this company does not produce military microchips but products that are publicly available on international civilian markets. The company cannot be blamed for anything. Other US companies have responded to allegations that they have not worked with the Russian market for a long time or that they do not find their products in the cited weapons systems.

All this raises a general question: if Russia buys chips and recycled Western chips from China are technology sanctions against Russia effective? Especially against the background of the fact that as it turned out some microchips can be found in the neighborhood store or the most ordinary online store.

Russia’s Most Advanced Weapons Are Shockingly Packed With ‘American Components’ — Ukrainian Intelligence,"Ukraine has revealed the use of US-made microchips in the Russian military hardware thereby raising questions about Moscow’s ability to produce the technological components.

When the Ukrainian military started dismantling Russian weapons many pieces of captured or partially destroyed equipment had an abundant use of foreign microchips particularly those manufactured in the US.

According to the list of components shared by Ukrainian Intelligence with The War Zone Ua US defense portal the chips were found inside a recovered example of the 9S932-1 a radar-equipped air defense command post vehicle that is part of the larger Barnaul-T system a Pantsir air defense system a Ka-52 “Alligator” attack helicopter and a Kh-101 (AS-23A Kodiak) cruise missile.

List Of Components

Barnaul-T is Russia’s most high-end air defense command and control subsystem within the larger integrated system for air defense of the Russian Army Marine units and Airborne forces.

The 9S932-1 is a radar-equipped reconnaissance/control module of the Barnaul-T subsystem which conducts round-the-clock reconnaissance and exercises command and control of subordinate troops and their armaments in warfare on combat positions.

Russian Barnaul-T 9S932-1 command posts and Tor-M2 air defense systems with “Z” markets reportedly in Genichesk Kherson oblast Ukraine. https://t.co/fWIyklbvmg pic.twitter.com/b2v5qvDkdx — Rob Lee (@RALee85) February 24 2022

This module is directly linked to units equipped with various Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) Systems including Tor-M-series (SA-15) and 9K35 Strela (SA-13) surface-to-air missile systems 9K33 Osa (SA-8) wheeled surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems 2K22 Tunguska (SA-19) tracked air defense systems and 9K333 Verba (SA-25) MANPAD systems.

The Ukrainian Intelligence said they found eight micro-chips in the communications systems of the 9S932-1 module sourced from US manufacturers like Intel Micrel Micron Technology and Atmel Corp.

The Pantsir air defense system is a well-known medium-range SAM and an anti-aircraft artillery system. The Ukrainian specialists reportedly found five US-made chips – manufactured by AMD Rochester Electronics Texas Instruments and Linear Technology – inside the direction finder of this air defense system.

The Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM) have been in the news for their unexpectedly high rate of failure in long-range attacks against Ukrainian targets. In the words of a US Defense official during a briefing in March “either they’re failing to launch or they’re failing to hit the target or they’re failing to explode on contact”.

In addition to the reportedly high failure rates the Kh-101 also appears to be heavily dependent on foreign-made chips as the Ukrainian intelligence claimed to have found at least 35 US-made chips including those manufactured by Texas Instruments Atmel Corp.

The high rate of failures and latest findings of such heavy dependence on foreign chips in Kh-101 ALCM should be concerning for Moscow as the missile’s Kh-102 variant is the Russian Air Force’s main air-launched nuclear-armed cruise missile.

Coming to the Ka-52 Alligator Russia’s twin-seat all-weather attack helicopter the Ukrainian specialists opened up its turreted electro-optical system in which they found 22 US-made chips and one Korean-made chip.

The US manufacturers included Texas Instruments IDT Altera USA Burr-Brown Analog Devices Inc. Micron Technology Linear Technology and TE Connectivity.

Chips Not Necessarily Sourced From Manufacturers

These chips may not have necessarily been sourced directly from the manufacturers as there is a massive and unregulated market for recycled chips emerging from China which could be a more likely source of these chips as many of them appear to be quite old according to Ukrainian specialists.

Also as reported earlier by EurAsian Times researchers in the UK revealed in April that Russia has been sourcing British-made dual-use components such as electronic chips and switchboards for its weaponry through intermediary businesses in India and China.

Earlier this month Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo who recently met Ukraine’s Prime Minister said during a Senate hearing “We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground it’s filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators.”

Components found in weapon systems are difficult to prevent from falling into the wrong hands but experts say that the US officials do have the authority to prevent shipments of such dual-use chips.

NATO Members Arming Russia?

The news comes after an astounding revelation in late April that how NATO members had used the ‘Grandfather Clause’ to bypass the EU embargo on Moscow.

According to an EU report at least ten NATO member states exported around €350 million ($378.6 million) in military hardware to Vladimir Putin’s regime out of which German and French companies accounted for 78 percent with €273 million ($295.4 million) worth of military export.

Despite an EU-wide embargo on arms supplies to Russia after the latter annexed Crimea in 2014 Germany and France delivered bombs rockets missiles and guns to Moscow.

In addition the French companies also delivered thermal imaging cameras as well as navigation systems for fighter aircraft attack helicopters and Russian tanks.

These member states took advantage of a loophole that allowed contracts signed before August 1 2014 or subsequent contracts that would help close those agreements to continue.

That said the latest findings have exposed the heavy dependence of Russian war machines on western technology in key sensitive areas such as targeting navigation communications and control systems of the weapons which could be deeply unsettling for Moscow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDUvMjkvbWFpbi1zdHJlZXRzLW1vc3QtcHJvbGlmaWMtY29ycG9yYXRlLWFnaXRhdG9yLWZpbmRzLWEtbmV3LWJhdHRsZWZpZWxkL9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA1LzI5L21haW4tc3RyZWV0cy1tb3N0LXByb2xpZmljLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1hZ2l0YXRvci1maW5kcy1hLW5ldy1iYXR0bGVmaWVsZC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Main Street’s most prolific corporate agitator finds a new battlefield,"From his rented one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles’ Redondo Beach a couple of blocks from a discount shop and a thrift store John Chevedden is polishing a speech he’ll give to Alphabet Inc.’s executives and shareholders at its annual meeting this week.

The former aerospace employee is pressing the $1.4 trillion tech giant to address the hot-button issue of disinformation. Getting other shareholders to back Chevedden’s call still a fledgling topic for most investors may be a long shot. But for Main Street’s most prolific corporate agitator it’s part of a new front he’s battling companies on — their impact on society.

Chevedden more of a governance warrior than a social activist has spent almost three decades pressuring the biggest U.S. companies from General Motors Co. to eBay Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. on how they’re run.

Wealthier investors such as Carl Icahn — and more recently Elon Musk — spend billions of dollars buying stakes in businesses in order to instigate corporate change. Instead Chevedden owns just a tiny fraction of a corporation’s stock and then every year he churns out a hundred or so shareholder proposals pressuring boardrooms and C-suites on everything from the minutiae of voting bylaws to bigger issues such as executive bonuses. Shareholders then determine the fate of those official requests when they vote at annual meetings.

Chevedden is part of a cohort of small activist shareholders who’ve been taking aim at corporations since long before retail investors caused last year’s meme stocks frenzy. By owning $2000 worth of a company’s shares for at least three years they write 500-word proposals and get them placed on ballots to be voted on at annual shareholder elections. Thousands of those meetings are underway across the country the bulk of them beginning in April and running through mid-June.

Critics have mocked Chevedden and others like him anointing them with the impolite name of corporate gadflies. But there’s motivation in their derision: Corporations over the years have collectively spent millions of dollars on lawyers to fight Chevedden’s relentless stream of proposals from landing on their ballots sometimes even suing him.

“If I’m a nuisance I’m one with purpose’’ the laconic 76-year-old said listing stock tickers of companies from Netflix Inc. to Dallas-based Texas Instruments Inc. where his proposals have won.

Shifting tactics

Now after decades focusing on the unglamorous world of corporate governance — the “G” in environmental social and governance investing — Chevedden is trying to capitalize on the latest zeitgeist: the “S.” Historically the domain of larger investors including public pension funds and religious investors social proposals attracted unprecedented support during last year’s shareholder meetings as big money managers such as BlackRock Inc. threw their heft behind requests focused on climate change and racial disparities.

Since social issues are increasingly getting in the eyes of investors Chevedden said of his new mantle “it’s best to go where the votes are.”

The first shareholder proposal Chevedden ever filed was personal. In 1994 after being laid off from his job as an administrator at Hughes Aircraft Co. he submitted a proposal to Hughes’ owner General Motors on its employment practices related to layoffs. He studied books on shareholder activism and spoke to corporate governance experts.

Chevedden’s GM proposal lost. But he was hooked by the combined thrill of fighting for the little-guy investor and holding powerful executives to account. Over the following decades he turned this new hobby into an unpaid profession submitting more than a thousand shareholder proposals while living off his savings and stock market investments.

“I don’t live a lavish lifestyle’’ said Chevedden who owns about 200 stocks collectively worth more than $1 million and drives a Honda Accord.

Shareholder activism was pioneered by New York brothers Lewis and John Gilbert who in the 1930s started pressing corporate executives on governance issues. Their work inspired other small investors including the late Evelyn Davis who for more than 50 years pressured companies and berated chief executives often appearing in costume at annual meetings.

Small shareholder activists have succeeded in getting companies to enact rules ranging from requiring directors to retain company stock for a certain period to having an independent board chair. Occasionally they pair up to file proposals and attend company meetings on each other’s behalf. (Chevedden sometimes partners with a group of three other shareholder activists who by comparison file only a few dozen proposals each year.) Despite their size they’ve had outsize influence on corporate America accounting for about a third of the 2500 or so proposals that landed on ballots since the start of 2017 according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

Companies fight to keep proposals off ballots by either trying to persuade filers to withdraw them or asking regulators to quash them. Failing that executives will urge shareholders to vote against the proposals. While corporations aren’t legally required to follow through on winning proposals many still do and do take note when resolutions get more than a quarter of the votes.

Tackling disinformation

Chevedden’s proposals have gotten an average of 39% shareholder backing over the past five years data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows. While many of his proposals don’t win those that do — sometimes with overwhelming investor support — have catalyzed change in the boardroom. His winning requests include getting all Netflix board directors to subject themselves to annual reelection; requiring FedEx Corp.’s board to get approval from shareholders on some severance or termination payments in executive pay packages; and at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. removing a requirement for a two-third majority vote for shareholder proposals according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

The downside of so many governance-oriented proposals getting adopted by companies is that “finding new issues that garner consensus among large shareholders may become more difficult’’ said Yaron Nili a law professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who wrote a paper on small activist investors. Which is why as investors flock to ESG — even as it comes under mounting criticism from insiders and Republicans alike — Chevedden has discovered a whole new battleground.

Chevedden’s initial way in was politics. Four years ago he started calling on companies including Fedex and Ford Motor Co. to disclose details of their political contributions and lobbying. “We don’t want companies supporting political candidates or pet projects of the CEO’’ he said. Since then more than a third of the 16 proposals Chevedden has filed on lobbying and political spending have won. This year he has five requests on the ballot.

Next in his path is disinformation. Not only has it fueled hate speech and violence during the pandemic it also has created gridlock in government preventing laws and regulations from being passed Chevedden said. “Misinformation results in general chaos’’ he said.

Google parent Alphabet is now in his crosshairs. His proposal is asking the tech giant to report the risks of disinformation — which he says it profits from — and how those risks affect society and the economy at large. A report “will help shareholders understand where the company’s prioritization of profits before people creates a financial risk to their portfolios’’ Chevedden said in the proposal which he wrote in partnership with a nonprofit called Shareholder Commons. (Another shareholder is asking Alphabet to commission an independent report on how it manages misinformation on its platforms. Meta Platforms Inc. formerly Facebook Inc. is facing a similar proposal from another investor.)

In response Alphabet asked regulators unsuccessfully to thwart Chevedden’s proposal from reaching the ballot and is now recommending that shareholders vote against it at Wednesday’s meeting. The company also has said that addressing misinformation is a top priority and that it’s doing everything from employing intelligence and security experts to blocking millions of pages and videos that violate policies. “We remain committed to fighting disinformation” Alphabet said in its proxy statement.

The company has been unscathed by Chevedden’s previous governance-related proposals over the years. (Two misinformation-related proposals filed by other investors with Alphabet in 2018 and 2019 failed to get more than 13% of votes according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.)

Two prominent firms that give recommendations to shareholders — Glass Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services — are suggesting investors vote against Chevedden’s proposal at Alphabet. “Although we have a number of concerns regarding the company’s practices and disclosures we aren’t of the view that adoption of this proposal would necessarily ameliorate these concerns’’ Glass Lewis said in a report.

Chevedden’s proposal will be one of 21 that will be voted on at Alphabet’s annual meeting. A spokeswoman for the company based in Mountain View Calif. referred to its proxy statement.

Activists like Chevedden view each proposal less as a now-or-never moment but the beginning of a longer awareness campaign to bring issues into the mainstream with other investors. So even if his Alphabet proposal doesn’t pass — the probable outcome — he is hardly deterred.

“It’s a feeling of being competent’’ Chevedden said of his life’s work noting that he relishes getting his proposals on ballots after corporations and their lawyers fight so hard to quash them. “Where else can someone that’s never gone to law school beat a $2 billion law firm?’’

Since its inception in 1987 Bread of the Mighty Food Bank has been feeding the hungry in Alachua Dixie Gilchrist Lafayette and Levy Counties. Marcia Conwell who led the food bank from 2011 to 2021 retired in August.

The Bread of the Mighty is a private nonprofit organization that collects sorts stores and distributes donated food and basic essentials to more than 190 nonprofit agency partners including food pantries churches homeless shelters and other organizations. The food bank has a 25000 square-foot warehouse and 10 trucks and vehicles transporting food to mobile pantries and partner agencies in five counties.

In February Sherah English and Tami Gray took over the reins of Bread of the Mighty serving and sharing responsibilities as co-chief executive officers. Gray also serves as finance director areas of responsibility include finance and development. English's responsibilities include program and operations.

Maureen Quinlan development and communications director said the food bank’s board of directors chose to establish a joint leadership structure that is popular among other food banks. By having this leadership structure Quinlan said Gray and English are more specialized in the critical components of the operation.

English said she has worked with food banks for more than six years in Gainesville and Jacksonville locations. Previously she worked as customer service manager at Publix Supermarket in Georgia and South Carolina. She is the mother of two girls ages 15 and 12.

Gray has worked at the food bank as director of finance for nine years. Previously she worked for Thermo Fisher Scientific as part of the asset management team assigned to the University of Florida. Gray also worked for nine years in the insurance market including Nationwide Insurance. She is married and has two adult children.

Gerald Booth is the warehouse manager a position he has held since November 2021. Previously he worked at Performance Food Group a food distributor with more than 14000 employees for five years in different leadership roles and has worked in a warehouse position for more than 14 years. He holds a bachelor of science in business administration.

Before joining the food bank staff Quinlan was program director at Creative Services a domestic violence/sexual assault center in Ocala. She says her 30-year career in non-profits includes 17 years in local United Ways. Born in Rhode Island she attended Syracuse University where she received bachelors degrees in public relations and international relations

Quinlan spoke about food insecurity in the community.

“Our biggest need is simple: food. We are asking the community to help by organizing food drives where they work attend church or social circles. Food provides us the power to the solution of hunger. Without food we cannot relieve the stress of hunger insecurity among individuals and families. Monetary donations will also be appreciated. For every $1 donated eight meals are provided to those in need.”

Quinlan said the increase in the cost of basic living needs is affecting everyone and everything especially groceries gas rent and utilities. “The very population that our partner agencies work with every day to offer relief is increasing and there is food insecurity” she said.

Quinlan said the biggest challenge facing the food bank is food insecurity as summer approaches monetary and food donations decline but need increases. “School soon will be out and for many families their children’s school is a major resource for meals — sometimes up to three a day” Quinlan said.

Gray and English said via email they want the community to get to know them. “What we do is to continue doing the work that has been done for the past 35 years which is to provide hope and encouragement to those facing hunger.""

Like most businesses Quinlan said future plans include adapting to business practices in a post-pandemic society with focus given to needs of the partner agencies who are serving those faced with hunger.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vcGFyYXNpdGVzYW5kdmVjdG9ycy5iaW9tZWRjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMC4xMTg2L3MxMzA3MS0wMjItMDUzMDctNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Defining the mechanisms of action and mosquito larva midgut response to a yeast-encapsulated orange oil larvicide ...,"In the present study we demonstrate the effects of YEOO a novel ingestible mosquito larvicide on the physiology and innate response gene expression profiles in Ae. aegypti L3. Ingestion of the YEOO resulted in cytotoxic events in larval midgut epithelial cells as well as clear upregulation of at least one apoptosis-related gene IAP1. Unlike traditional single-target insecticides YEOO displays multi-modal action affecting multiple cellular pathways. Thus we predict that YEOO activity is independent of specific midgut receptors and that its killing mechanisms are based on its toxicity to midgut cells. Multi-target larvicides such as Bti or multi-modal larvicides like YEOO are thought to be less likely to incur resistance [11 18 19]. To date resistance to EOs has not been reported.

EOs and their derivatives have been investigated in vitro against neglected tropical parasites and arboviruses for decades [35]. They have been utilized as contact irritants against adult and larval stages of various insect pests [36]. Further they have been shown to cause testicular apoptosis and morphological damage to the fat body and midgut epithelium of Spodoptera frugiperda (lepidopteran) larvae [37 38]. Other natural compounds such as squamocin an extract from the Amazonian plant Derris urucu have been tested against Ae. aegypti larvae on which both cytotoxic and gene expression profiles effects were assessed [39 40].

Encapsulated EOs offer a significant advantage over free EOs. Moreover whereas the hydrophobicity of free EOs makes them unlikely candidates for commercial use. The encapsulation approach using S. cerevisiae provides an optimal delivery mechanism that facilitates dissemination throughout aquatic environments. When sequestered into yeast cells EOs are effectively protected against photolytic degradation allowing for long-term stability [20]. In the present study the integrity of the reconstituted YEOO was confirmed via TEM analysis. Finally upon ingestion by the mosquito larvae the yeast cell wall is digested by the various β-glucanases [21] present within the midgut of the larvae allowing for targeted released of the EO payload.

Although our results on gene expression profiles only provide indirect evidence the increased expression of the midgut epithelial cell regenerator Vein at 4 h post YEOO exposure with concomitant upregulation of CASPS8 at 8 h post YEOO exposure is suggestive of an innate response to reconstitute the midgut epithelia damaged by the larvicide. This is also hypothesized to be a last-ditch effort to clear dead and dying cells from the YEOO non-specific broad-acting mode of action. Moreover the modulation observed in both IAP1 and IAP2 is potentially associated with their regulatory roles regarding initiator or effector caspases [41]. Accordingly IAP1 has been shown to interact and regulate the expression of the initiator caspase Dredd and the effector caspases CASPS7 and CASPS8 [42 43]. These effector caspases carry out proteolysis and disintegration of proteins during cell death [414243]. With regards to IAP2 studies in Drosophila melanogaster demonstrated its role during expression of apoptotic-associated genes and the negative regulation of the IMD innate immunity) pathway [44] in a fashion similar to the negative regulator Pirk [45].

The cytotoxic effects observed following YEOO ingestion were broad with drastic alteration in cell morphology at both the cellular and subcellular levels in the insect midgut. While YEOO appeared to have produced no specific alterations of the larval PM2 there was substantial damage to midgut epithelia including loss of microvilli disordered cellular junctions and increased cytoplasmic vacuolization in laminar bodies. In the cytosol increased vacuolization and abnormal morphological alterations of the mitochondria and cristae also were observed.

In general apoptotic signaling is linked with mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and other cofactors to activate effector caspases [46]. The presence of circular-shaped mitochondria observed in our TEM images of midgut cells following YEOO exposure is likely due to the cellular cytotoxicity affecting mitochondrial proteins that coordinate cytochrome c release and promote the apoptosis expression cascade suggested by the differential expression of IAP and CASP and supportive of apoptosis-mediated killing.

However it has been previously reported that expression of ATG1 ATG6 and ATG8 is correlated with the expression of V-ATPase following exposure of Ae. aegypti larvae to the plant-derived fatty acid compound squamocin [39]. Following YEOO ingestion the expressions of ATG1 or ATG6 as well as of V-ATPase (data not shown) were not significantly different when compared to those of larvae fed on inactivated yeast. Further in D. melanogaster autophagic cell death in the midgut is accompanied by markers of apoptosis such as DNA fragmentation [47]. Similarly the typical pattern of DNA degradation was observed in our TUNEL analysis in moribund larvae. Although the relationship between the autophagic and apoptotic pathways is not yet clear increased levels of cytoplasmic vacuolization and cell death were observed within 30 min following the ingestion of YEOO by mosquito larvae as depicted in our TEM images. Despite a lack of direct evidence the presence of an autophagic mechanism inducible by YEOO and acting in concert with apoptosis possibly associated with tolerance mechanisms against the non-specific toxic effects observed has not yet been discarded.

Following ingestion YEOO is likely digested by proteases secreted within the larval midgut [21]. We excluded the possibility that the breakdown of the yeast cell wall might have been caused by pH variations within the larval gut by testing YEOO in solutions with increasing pH. No changes in YEOO stability were detected in solutions with the pH ranging from 7 to 10. It remains to be determined if YEOO breakdown is due to a continued action of digestive proteases or whether it involves a combination of factors that create a domino effect resulting in cell wall breakdown and the release of the orange oil.

Insecticide resistance poses a serious threat to the control of mosquito-borne diseases. Traditional vector management programs either increase insecticide applications to kill resistant populations or must switch to another pesticide to achieve control. These approaches have not generated any significant advantages for mosquito control but have instead contributed to the increase of resistance in mosquito vectors. Continuous exposure to organophosphates and pyrethroids [484950] have resulted in the overproduction of CYP enzymes [48 51 52] that are necessary for detoxification of the various pesticides. Distinct mosquito species or strains possess unique detoxification or innate mechanisms to cope with the various pesticide classes. In response to YEOO differential expression was observed between the genes coding for the CYP6 and CYP9 families suggesting that these detoxifying enzymes are distinctively regulated according to chemical exposure or challenge. However the results observed with the CYP profiles in our view are not directly associated with YEOO resistance. The broad mode of action demonstrated by YEOO likely limits the possibility of emergence of resistance. We believe that for YEOO resistance to develop a midgut remodeling process would likely be involved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xMjkwMy0w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multivariate statistical approach and machine learning for the evaluation of biogeographical ancestry inference in the ...,"PCA PLS-DA and XGBoost models at inter-continental level

As proposed in different papers28697071 PCA was first performed to preliminary investigate the available datasets involving the four selected AIMs panels for BGA inference. As expected for the first level of BGA (i.e. inter-continental BGA) inference several separate clusters corresponding to African American Asian European and Oceanian individuals were observed in the space of the first two PCs (Fig. 1). This result turned straightforward for all the evaluated AIMs panels.

Figure 1 PCA Scores plots showing the PCA models obtained for the different evaluated AIMs panels. Full size image

After an initial PCA analysis with the Asian continent in its entirety the Asian was subdivided into its regions due to its breadth -within our dataset individuals were belonging to different regions of Asia- and the fact that the prediction of the biogeographical origin within the Asian continent has been and is a subject extensively studied in the forensic field257273747576.

As in our dataset if considering Asia composed by Central East North and South Asia populations PCA plot highlights that African East Asian Oceanian and (partially) North Asian and European individuals showed a better differentiation from the other tested individuals while American South Asian Central Asian and Middle East subjects provided an overlap in the PCA space. In addition better separation of the evaluated populations can be observed in Additional file 1: Fig. S1 also involving three principal components (for a total amount of CEV% equal to 83%).

All the evaluated AIMs panels show a similar degree of separation among individuals belonging to different continental areas. However only the African individuals reveal a separate cluster in all the panels presumably due to the history of humans in Africa that is complex and includes demographic events that influenced patterns of genetic variation across the continent and the fact that modern humans first appeared in Africa roughly 250000–350000 years before present and subsequently migrated to other parts of the world77.

As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S1ab the African individuals generate an elongated cluster (dark yellow) that extends towards the gray one corresponding to the Middle East region. By evaluating the African individuals closest to the Middle East cluster we observed that they belong to the populations of northern Africa. The Middle East cluster is in the middle of the European and South Asian clusters and partly overlaps. The light blue cluster that corresponds to the admixed and non-admixed American population is projected toward the European cluster and partly overlaps with it suggesting that admixed American individuals have an important proportion of European ancestry78.

As it can be observed in Fig. 1 and in Additional file 1: Fig. S1 the distribution of the populations in the space of the PCs perfectly reflects the distribution of the populations in the globe: indeed geographically distant populations are located distantly in the PCA plot while geographically close populations regardless of whether they belong to a continent or another are close in the PCA plot.

Similar PCA plots were obtained by Glusman et al.79 and Haber et al.80 using a significantly greater number of SNPs 300000 and 240000 respectively than those tested in all the forensic panels. Therefore as previously highlighted286970 despite the limited number of SNPs the performance of each panel across populations was generally consistent even if some genetic markers performed more than others.

However although PCA analysis allows us to assign an individual to his/her population of origin through a visual intuitive and easy to interpret approach it does not provide significant divergence between populations and obviously it cannot be used alone in forensic context because it does not provide an accurate statistical estimate of the weight of the evidence69.

PLS-DA was then applied to the same experimental sets based on PCA modeling results to develop more reliable discrimination models to classify the variables. As a result for the first level of BGA (i.e. inter-continental BGA) inference African American East Asian South Asian Central Asian North Asian European and Oceanian individuals were effectively separated using models involving two latent variables (LVs) (Fig. 2). This result turned noteworthy for all the evaluated panels.

Figure 2 PLS-DA Scores plots showing the models obtained for the different evaluated AIMs panels. Full size image

Even if the PCA and PLS-DA plots may seem similar the obtained Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves together with the values of sensitivity specificity and AUC highlight the importance of a statistical tool to infer BGA. PLS-DA models for African American Asian European and Oceanian individuals provided optimal predictions with the CEV% values higher than 98% for all populations in all panels investigated except Oceania—Euroforgen (CEV% 88%) ForenSeq (CEV% 79%) MAPlex (CEV% 86%) and Thermo Fisher (CEV% 79%) and America in ForenSeq (CEV% 95%) panel-. The Oceania population results might be affected by the small number of individuals in the dataset showing this ancestry. All the developed models provided a CEV% higher than 80% and all the tested AIMs panels proved reliable results that remarked the necessity to use a proper classification model rather than PCA modeling to infer BGA robustly.

In addition through the PLS-DA model the MaPlex panel ability to differentiate the set of individuals from South Asian to others was estimated with a high degree of accuracy (AUC = 0.9828). As expected from the preliminary assessment of MaPlex29 no other panel considered in this study was found to be comparable with it in enhancing South Asian differentiation (Fig. 3). Outstanding discrimination was obtained for East Asian populations in all panels considered associated with less discrimination for Central and North Asian probably due to the limited number of Asian population samples in our dataset the use of unsuitable markers to discriminate these areas and the fact that Asia has been a critical hub of human migration and population admixture818283.

Figure 3 ROC curves sensitivity specificity and AUC values for the tested continental populations. Full size image

As shown in Fig. 3 there are some populations showing poor sensitivity and specificity values. As an example South Asian individuals have low values for EUROFORGEN ForenSeq and Thermo Fisher panels while they are classified with promising results using the MAPlex panel. Similar behaviours are also observed for Middle East and Oceania individuals. These results reflect the fact that some panels like MAPlex have been developed to deeply investigate specific populations (i.e. Asia–Pacific populations) and their classification might be prone to better identify such individuals29. On the other hand some populations (like Oceanian and Middle East subjects) showed a lower number of available individuals compared to the other tested populations so that the classification performance are not optimal and might be improved by raising the number of investigated subjects.

In accordance with Phillips et al.29 our results indicated enhanced South Asian differentiation (AUC = 0.98) using MaPlex panel compared to other forensic panels (Fig. 4) but no increased differentiation between West Eurasian and East Asian populations was detected.

Figure 4 Comparison between AUC values of different populations obtained from PLS-DA and XGBoost model at inter-continental level considering Asian divided into regions. Full size image

Afterward the best XGBoost model obtained after the grid search approach provided the following performances (Table 1) in terms of sensitivity specificity and AUC. XGBoost algorithm was tested to compare its performances with those from PLS-DA to evaluate another ML model aimed to obtain optimal and feasible inference models for BGA prediction.

Table 1 Sensitivity specificity and AUC values of the optimal XGBoost model built at inter-continental level for all panels investigated. Full size table

As it can be seen by the values reported in Table 1 XGBoost model provides interesting results but slightly lower than those of PLS-DA models especially when comparing the AUC values (Fig. 4).

As shown in Fig. 4 optimal AUC values (close to 1) were observed for African American East Asian and European populations using PLS-DA method while lower results (around 0.8) were obtained for Central Asia Middle East North Asia Oceania and South Asia (with the exception of MAPlex panel involving a PLS-DA model) areas. The best results were achieved when using PLS-DA modeling showing AUC values substantially higher than those obtained by XGBoost. The worst predictions were those involving the South Asian populations overall with AUC values around 0.6. In parallel STRUCTURE software was tested as a benchmark comparison. The AUC of STRUCTURE was calculated by comparing the ancestry predictions from STRUCTURE software with the real ancestry origins of the tested populations and individuals. Firstly the number of K clusters (i.e. populations) we selected for our comparison with STRUCTURE was equal to the number of ancestry populations we tested for the different PLS-DA and XGBoost models at inter-continental and inter-continental levels. Then using CLUMPP together with STRUCTURE we were able to obtain the Q-matrices containing the membership coefficients for each individual in each cluster. Therefore each individual was assigned to the ancestry (k-th cluster) showing the highest membership coefficient: this approach allowed us to obtain ROC curves and AUC values for comparing STRUCTURE approach to the predictions and the performance provided by PLS-DA and XGBoost models.

Comparison between AUC values of different populations obtained from PLS-DA XGBoost and STRUCTURE model at inter-continental level is reported in the Fig. 5. As it can be observed in Fig. 5 better performance was achieved when using PLS-DA modeling rather than STRUCTURE for diverse continents such as Africa America Europe and most of Asia (central east and north Asian) for all panels investigated. Different results were observed in south Asia Middle East and Oceania where STRUCTURE model seems to work best in almost all panels investigated with the exception of MaPlex panel in South Asia. The worst predictions were those involving XGBoost with AUC values on average lower than STRUCTURE except for Central Asian and North Asia.

PCA PLS-DA and XGBoost models at intra-continental level

PCA model was assessed to infer BGA at continental level and as expected2869 unsatisfactory separations were observed (an example is shown in Fig. 6 for MAPlex panel). In particular the following countries and populations were evaluated for the different geographical areas:

Africa: African Caribbeans Gambia Kenya Nigeria Sierra Leone;

America: Colombia Mexican Ancestry from Los Angeles Mexico Peru Puerto Rico;

Asia: Bangladesh China India Japan Pakistan Sri Lanka;

Europe: Finland France Great Britain Italy Spain Israel.

Figure 6 PCA Scores plots showing the PCA models obtained for the different countries and populations tested using the Maplex panel. Full size image

These countries and populations were selected since they showed more than 80 genotyped individuals in the analyzed dataset; therefore Oceanian individuals were not considered since the number of genotyped subjects was too limited. As observed in Fig. 6 no significant differences or clusters were detected when using PCA exploratory strategy. Considering Asian population plot Japan and China provided a different cluster when compared to the other Asian countries but despite the MAPlex panel was specifically developed to provide differentiation of Asian population can discriminate South from East Asian populations but the sub-populations in these geographical areas cannot be separated from each other. Similar results were observed for all the other BGA AIMs panels (Additional file 1: Figs. S2 S3 S4 S5).

In summary if this traditional multivariate approach allows us to suggest the BGA of known individuals at the inter-continental level it fails at intra-continental level presumably due to the statistical method that is incapable to classify the variables.

Therefore the application of the PCA model can be considered inadequate for forensic BGA inference goals. For this reason we adopted proper classification models such as PLS-DA and XGBoost to improve our models’ performance and obtain adequate separations among the populations.

Therefore PLS-DA and XGBoost models were evaluated at intra-continental level. Figure 7 reports the models and the performance results of the PLS-DA model built to discriminate among the African population.

Figure 7 ROC curves sensitivity specificity and AUC values for African countries and populations. Full size image

In the African scenario the best results were achieved by EUROFORGEN and Thermo Fisher panels but also MAPlex panel provided interesting results.

The AUC values of the EUROFORGEN panel (Fig. 7) between 0.8 and 0.9 for two out of five populations analyzed and greater than 0.9 for the remaining three suggest an excellent capacity of discrimination and outstanding discrimination respectively of the SNPs in the panel. Thermo Fisher and MaPlex panel obtained similar results.

Presumably due to the limited numbers of markers in the panel the worst classification performances were provided by the ForenSeq panel with an average AUC value of 0.798 the lowest value compared to the other panels. These results can also be assessed from the scores plots reported in Additional file 1: Fig. S6 where several clusters are visible from the PLS-DA models built using the different AIMs panels.

The AUC value very close to 100% observed for the African population in all panels tested (Fig. 3) highlights their outstanding discrimination at the inter-continental level and a slightly less capability albeit excellent in most of the panels at intra-continental level (Fig. 7). Indeed the average AUC values for all panels in African population range from an acceptable discrimination for Forenseq panel (average AUC value = 0.798) to an outstanding discrimination for MaPlex and Thermo Fisher panel with the average AUC values equal to 0.92 and 0.91 respectively.

The XGBoost model was also performed and Tables S1 in Additional file 1 shows the sensitivity specificity and AUC values for African populations.

AUC values of PLS-DA and XGBoost model were compared (Fig. 8).

Figure 8 Comparison of AUC values obtained fromPLS-DA and XGBoost model for African population. Full size image

Interesting AUC values (around 0.9) were observed for African Carribean Gambian Kenyan and Nigerian individuals while the worst results (0.8 for PLS-DA 0.6 for XGBoost) were obtained for the subjects from Sierra Leone presumably influenced by the lower number of individuals in the population. Again the best performances were achieved using PLS-DA modeling.

In the American framework (Fig. 9) no specific panel or model outperformed the others. Good discrimination results were observed using EUROFORGEN and MAPlex panels for the individuals from Mexico and Peru and Puerto Rico (in all cases AUC value is higher than 0.97) and Colombia (for MAPlex only with an AUC value of 0.85). On the other hand the Thermo Fisher panel showed the best results in discriminating the individual of Mexican ancestry living in Los Angeles (US) (AUC value of 0.88) but also ForenSeq panel provided remarkable results (AUC value of 0.84). Thermo Fisher panel also provided reliable classification results (AUC value of 0.98) when dealing with subjects from Puerto Rico (as well as EUROFORGEN (0.97) and MAPlex (0.99) panels). These results can also be observed from the scores plots reported in Additional file 1: Fig. S7 showing several clusters among the tested countries and populations.

Figure 9 ROC curves sensitivity specificity and AUC values for American countries and populations. Full size image

In addition in the American scenario all panels investigated except MaPlex show AUC values higher than 0.95 at inter-continental level (Fig. 3) and a very slightly less capability of discrimination was observed at inter-continental level with the average AUC values higher than 0.90 for all panels (Fig. 9). Therefore particular attention should be paid with the MaPlex panel. In this case the AUC value at inter-continental level is much lower (AUC = 0.77) than the average value obtained at intra-continental level (AUC mean = 0.93) showing a better discrimination at intra-continental level rather than at inter-continental one. This might be because there is a lower variability in the analyzed data (as well as in the number of tested populations) and in this scenario the algorithms are capable of predicting and inferring BGA with improved performances.

Tables S2 in additional file 1 shows the sensitivity specificity and AUC values of XGBoost model for American population. AUC values of PLS-DA and XGBoost models were compared (Fig. 10).

Figure 10 Comparison of AUC values obtained from PLS-DA and XGBoost model for American population. Full size image

As shown in Fig. 10 optimal AUC values (around 1 for PLS-DA) were observed when inferring the BGA for individuals from Mexico Peru and Puerto Rico while lower performances (around 0.8 for PLS-DA) were obtained when evaluating Colombian and Mexican Ancestry from Los Angeles individuals. Again the best performances were achieved using PLS-DA modeling.

In the Asian framework (Fig. 11) similar results were obtained. On average the best results were obtained when evaluating the Thermo Fisher and MAPlex panels especially for the individuals from China Japan and Pakistan with AUC values equal to 0.99 0.98 and 0.95 respectively for Thermo panel and 0.98 0.98 and 0.86 for MaPlex panel. Excellent discrimination was achieved also for India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka with AUC greater than 0.80 showing the ability of these two panels to differentiate sub-populations.

Figure 11 ROC curves sensitivity specificity and AUC values for Asian countries and populations. Full size image

The scores plot provided two separated clusters; the first one consists of China and Japan while the second cluster reported the individuals from Bangladesh India Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Additional file 1: Fig. S8).

Tables S3 in additional file 1 shows the sensitivity specificity and AUC values of XGBoost model for Asian population. AUC values of PLS-DA and XGBoost models were compared (Fig. 12).

Figure 12 Comparison of AUC values obtained from PLS-DA and XGBoost model for Asian population. Full size image

The best AUC values (around 1 for PLS-DA) were obtained when inferring the BGA for individuals from China Japan and Puerto Rico while lower results (around 0.8 for PLS-DA) were obtained when evaluating individuals from Bangladesh India and Sri Lanka. The lowest results were showed by the XGBoost model on Bangladesh subjects and once again the best performances were achieved with PLS-DA modeling.

Finally no specific AIMs panel or model outperformed the others when evaluating the European countries and populations except for the ForenSeq panel that presents the worst results presumably due to the low numbers of markers analyzed. The scores plot provided several separate clusters for all the evaluated populations and these results can also be observed from the scores plots reported in Additional file 1: Fig. S9.

As shown in Fig. 13 the best discrimination result was achieved for Finland populations (AUC ≥ 0.93) for all panels investigated. It has to be noted that the best results for the French individuals were obtained with EUROFORGEN and MAPlex AIMs panels while for the other groups (Italians English Spanish and Finns) the results are comparable.

Figure 13 ROC curves sensitivity specificity and AUC values for European countries and populations. Full size image

Tables S4 in additional file 1 shows the sensitivity specificity and AUC values of XGBoost model for European population. AUC values of PLS-DA and XGBoost models were compared (Fig. 14).

Figure 14 Comparison of AUC values obtained from PLS-DA and XGBoost model for European population. Full size image

Optimal AUC values (around 0.9–1) were observed for all the PLS-DA models in this scenario instead of the XGBoost models showing significantly lower results.

STRUCTURE approach was also compared with PLS-DA and XGBoost model at intra-continental level by evaluating the populations selected for the Africans as an example. The results in terms of comparison of the AUC values are reported in the Fig. 15. As already observed at inter-continental level PLS-DA and in most cases XGBoost provided on average better performance in terms of accuracy when compared to STRUCTURE approach also at intra-continental level.

Figure 15 Comparison of AUC values obtained from PLS-DA XGBoost and STRUCTURE model for African population. Full size image

Comparing the ROC curves of all forensic panels both at inter-continental level and at intra-continental level a decrease in the accuracy in inferring BGA at intra-continental level was observed. This decrease may be explained by the natural geographical distribution of some populations: “populations that share geographical borders and cultural practices are closely related genetically and these populations show similar genetic patterns”72 by the SNPs in forensic panels selected with the aim of discriminating populations at continental level286973 and by their number which is relatively low compared to that used in other genetic fields through NGS technology.",,,,,,

It was the third time in the past two months that Ryan Taylor 31 and Brooke Scheer 30 stole from the retailer on Los Angeles Avenue according to the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office.

During the previous two thefts in late April and early May Taylor stole a combined $900 worth of power tools while Scheer waited for him outside in a stolen white Toyota sedan according to authorities.

The same white sedan was used in the third theft on May 12 but Taylor replaced Scheer behind the wheel before they made their escape. As they were exiting Tractor Supply’s parking lot Taylor “violently” crashed into another car and injured the other driver police said.

Taylor then drove westbound on Los Angeles Avenue and abandoned the car in a dirt parking lot off County Drive in Saticoy. The two were eventually found approximately 200 yards away and arrested by deputies from the sheriff’s gang unit.

Deputies said the car the pair was driving had recently been stolen in Oxnard.

Scheer and Taylor were charged with conspiracy and possessing stolen property and drugs. The charge of leaving the scene after injuring another driver is still under investigation police said.

Both pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Because Scheer and Taylor are on bail for similar criminal charges the court granted an increase in bail. The two have since made bail and been released.

Taylor was due back in court May 27 for a preliminary examination conference.

This is not the first time the pair have been charged with theft. In October Scheer and Taylor were charged with driving a stolen car. Before being arrested May 12 Scheer had been awaiting sentencing on May 17 for stealing that car court records show.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8va3Jkby5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA1LzI5L3dvb2RsYW5kLXBhcmstbWFuLWZhY2luZy1zZXZlcmFsLWZlbG9ueS1jaGFyZ2VzLWZvci1jaGlsZC1zZXh1YWwtYXNzYXVsdC1leHBsb2l0YXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woodland Park man facing several felony charges for child sexual assault exploitation,"WOODLAND PARK Colo. (KRDO) -- A Woodland Park man was arrested Friday accused of assaulting underage children and selling pornographic images of his young victims on social media.

19-year old Samuel Harris faces several felony level charges including sexual assault of a child under the age of 15 and three sexual exploitation of a child charges.

Harris was taken into custody at his workplace Friday morning at Tractor Supply Co. off of Highway 67 near downtown Woodland Park.

According to police minutes after the 19-year old clocked in for his shift investigators had Harris in cuffs and were escorting him to jail.

According to court records five underage victims came forward to Woodland Park investigators with accusations throughout their investigation.

The investigation began in November of 2021 when an alleged victim reported Harris to a Student Resource Officer at Woodland Park High School.

Harris is accused of filming sex acts between two underage children sexually assaulting a 14-year old child and selling sexually explicity photos of underage children on Snapchat for $20 a picture.

Hours after his arrest on Friday Woodland Park police say Harris posted his $20000 bond and was released from the Teller County Jail.

13 Investigates attempted to reach out to Harris' public defender named in his arrest warrant on Sunday. However we were unable to contact the 19-year old's defense team for comment.

With a search warrant investigators seized Harris’ phone which is currently in the hands of the Colorado Springs Police Department's Digital Forensic Detectives.

Court documents alleged that Harris would not provide investigators the passcode to his phone. Using an algorithm CSPD detectives are working to obtain that passcode but the process could take days or even several years according to court records.

Despite this investigators say they've obtained pictures messages and videos containing four underage children ingesting narcotics and engaging in other hazardous behaviors.

From Harris’ iCloud account investigators say they obtained multiple videos with pornographic images of underage children shot on Harris' phone.

Woodland Park Police are asking anyone who may have been victimized by Harris to contact their department as soon as possible.

Following Harris' arrest Woodland Park Police Chief Chris Deisler provided a statement to 13 Investigates:

“The arrest of Sam Harris is the result of an exhaustive investigation by numerous members of the Woodland Park Police Department who work in several areas of the agency. Our collective goal is and will be the safeguarding of our community and most particularly our children. Anyone in our city who has chosen to prey upon them in any way should continue looking over their shoulder because we will not tolerate it. Putting handcuffs on them too at any time or any place is not a matter of “if” but a simple matter of “when”. Woodland Park Police Chief Chris Deisler

The Airline Changed My Flight Itinerary (for the Worse) (Published 2022),"Dear Tripped Up

My question is about airlines switching itineraries a huge frustration for me since returning to travel after a pandemic pause. I will book a direct flight at a good time and then get an email days or weeks later with an inconvenient time change or an added layover or both. The worst was when I was planning a trip with my daughter to Tampa Fla. In January I booked a direct flight on Southwest Airlines that left Hartford Conn. at 12:30 p.m. on April 17 and arrived in Tampa three hours later. Perfect. But on Feb. 15 Southwest emailed that they had moved me onto a 6:15 p.m. flight with a nearly three-hour layover in Nashville getting me to Tampa at 1:10 a.m.! Why is this OK? It’s like I bought a nice Subaru Forester and they delivered a dilapidated and rusty Trans Am and told me it was the only option. Phoebe Massachusetts

Dear Phoebe

Leave it to airlines to make car dealerships seem transparent by comparison. While you could certainly sue your fictional dealer for breach of contract the real Southwest was within their contractual rights to cancel your original flight and put you on that midnight plane from Nashville.

There’s no law against an airline unilaterally changing your itinerary and in such cases the main rule the U.S. government requires the airlines to follow is a flimsy one. If a carrier imposes a new itinerary on a customer that would result in a “significant delay” the company must offer you a refund in your case $264 each for two “Wanna Get Away” fares Southwest’s equivalent of economy class.

They did but as you told me over Zoom canceling the trip wouldn’t do: You wanted to go to Florida and had already arranged lodging. The airline gave you another option saying you could search for an alternative Southwest itinerary then make the change online or through customer service (which you did painfully as we’ll get to later).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vZ3JlZW52aWxsZS9idXNpbmVzcy9ncmFjZS1jaHVyY2gtcGxhbnMtbWl4ZWQtdXNlLXJlZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtb2YtZm9ybWVyLXRyYXZlbGVycy1yZXN0LW1pbGwtc2l0ZS9hcnRpY2xlXzBhZGFjNmEwLWRkZmItMTFlYy05NTVhLTJmZDQwZjI1MWZhNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grace Church plans mixed-use redevelopment of former Travelers Rest mill site,"TRAVELERS REST — The move of Methodical Coffee's operations to a warehouse space on U.S. 276 is part of a larger effort to repurpose an expansive former textile mill property for new industry and services.

The property that is now home to Grace Church's satellite campus north of Travelers Rest will be marketed as Millstead part of a 13.5-acre campus that aims to attract other production companies as well as provide space for medical offices and retail.

""Millstead is a mixed-use development replacing mill operations and its employees with new places of worship and businesses for residents of Travelers Rest and surrounding communities"" business operations head Jeff Randolph a developer by trade said May 27.

In 2020 the church through a subsidiary bought the 111000-square-foot warehouse building with a new worship space in mind as the congregation temporarily met in Travelers Rest High School.

The warehouse situated along the Swamp Rabbit Trail will be home to Methodical's new operations venture Methodical Manufactory and Nicholas James Fine Woodworks.

Earlier this month Methodical bought a nearly 40000-square-foot portion of the warehouse to accommodate its bean roasting storage and distribution. Non-profit wall climbing venture GOAT will also share the space.

The coffee company plans to move from its roasting operation in the Monaghan Mill community this October.

After completing an environmental cleanup the subsidiary is marketing outparcels for medical and retail development. The redevelopment was eligible for state tax credits associated with the revitalization of former textile plants and communities.

The site was once home to the Renfrew Bleachery mill which was built in 1928 by the Brandon Corporation to produce Devonshire cloth and table damask fabric.

Fire Chief Bill Hellard called retired chief Mark Cunningham forward with Cunningham not aware of what was about to happen.

Cunningham who served the Fire Department for more than 37½ years started as a volunteer firefighter was a part-time fire chief for about five years and then was named Farmington's first full-time fire chief on Jan. 1 2005. The fire station on Main Street in Farmington was built in 2003.

""Mark was instrumental in building this fire station here"" Hellard said. ""Mark has done a lot for the Fire Department for the community ... so Farmington Fire Station No. 1 will be dedicated to him.""

Those attending the breakfast applauded and cheered the announcement.

The plaque read: ""This building is dedicated to Fire Chief Mark Cunningham for his many years of dedicated service to the Farmington Fire Department and the city of Farmington.""

Cunningham teared up as Hellard talked about Cunningham's accomplishments as fire chief and read the inscription on the plaque.

Afterward Cunningham made very brief remarks: ""I didn't know this was going to happen. The fire chief is just as good as his firemen. We've had the best.""

Saturday's breakfast was the first one since March 2019 and the first one for Hellard. The Fire Department canceled the breakfast in 2020 and 2021 because of the covid-19 pandemic. The department tried to have the breakfast on Sept. 11 of last year but had to cancel because of an increase in covid cases in the state.

""It's good to see the community and have them back together again and have them in the fire station "" Hellard said. ""We like for them to come out and see what we do.""

Hellard said he appreciates the community support and thanked the volunteers who had been preparing all week for the breakfast. He estimated about 680 people attended the breakfast.

""It's a lot of work"" Hellard said. But he added ""it's so important to the community. We've got to have it for the community.""

Several businesses donated food and drinks for the breakfast including Walmart Tyson Foods and Starbucks.

The Richmond City Council approved the new district maps on Monday concluding a redistricting process that all localities are required to complete every 10 years per the country’s routine population count.

According to 2020 U.S. Census and district population data from the city 3666 people were shuffled throughout the city’s 1st 2nd 3rd 5th 6th and 7th districts. The changes impact parts of the Rosedale Laburnum Park Barton Heights Union Hill Museum District Monroe Ward and Fan neighborhoods.

Redistricting occurs after the latest 10-year census data is released to ensure localities are divided into similarly sized shapes so that a vote in any district carries the same weight.

The city’s population over the past decade increased by 11% from 204000 to 226600 according to last year’s census data. Each district needs about 25000 residents to make them equal.

In order to achieve parity the city needed to adjust the boundaries of the 2nd 3rd 6th and 7th districts as they deviated from the ideal population count by more than 5%.

Council members made changes to a few additional districts to balance the populations in accordance with criteria that were adopted at the start of the process. The criteria included goals for avoiding split voting precincts for local state and federal districts; maximizing voter convenience and effective administration of elections; and maintaining “communities of interest.”

While some local residents were involved in the map drawing process earlier in the year very few people spoke in public hearings after the city put out its redistricting proposal.

In addition to the new district map the City Council voted Monday to close the voting precinct at the Arthur Ashe Center as the city is planning to redevelop the property as part of the Diamond District project.

The city per the council ordinance will create new voting precincts for the 2nd and 3rd districts at Maggie L. Walker Governor’s School; the 6th District at United Nations Church; and the 7th District at Main Street Station.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9ldmVuLWNoaWNrZW4taXMtZ2V0dGluZy10b28tZXhwZW5zaXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Even chicken is getting too expensive?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://themalaysianreserve.com/2022/05/28/even-chicken-is-getting-too-expensive/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOC9ldmVuLWNoaWNrZW4taXMtZ2V0dGluZy10b28tZXhwZW5zaXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Expect some more travel M&A by these banks.

Chase is planning to launch ChaseTravel.com later this year as a consumer portal for its cardholders and its bank customers a total of 66 million U.S. households in a big upgrade on its ambitions in the travel sector.

It is also disclosing details on the size of its travel business for the first time: it expects to reach about $8 billion in sales volume this year and aiming for $15 billion by 2025. It also said that in terms of U.S> leisure travel $1 in every $4 spent is on a Chase Card and $1 in every $3 spent is by a Chase customer. It also disclosed that it has now identified and plans to launch eight airport Chase Sapphire Lounges up from its previously disclosed four.

All of these details were disclosed at parent company JPMorgan Chase’s annual 2022 investor day earlier in May buried inside hundreds of slide presentations and presented by Marianne Lake co-CEO of consumer and community banking at JPMC on the investor day.

According to Lake: “We saw an opportunity during the pandemic to own our own destiny in travel and we acquired cxLoyalty a proprietary two-sided travel platform and Frosch itself a top ten leisure travel agency providing us now with the booking engine the content the servicing excellence and the concierge capabilities that our customers should expect. And today we estimate we are a top five U.S. consumer travel provider. “

This move to supersize its ambitions in travel and control its own destiny — vs. banks and credit card companies that typically work with third party travel agencies — comes on the backs of its acquisitions over the pandemic of travel loyalty and rewards services provider cxLoyalty and corporate and luxury travel agency Frosch. Chase has already migrated over its cardholders who use its rewards platform Ultimate Rewards to the cxLoyalty platform and as a result ditched Expedia as its sole travel provider.

It also comes as its financial competitor Capital One also leaned heavily into travel during the pandemic with its acquisition of companies such as Freebird Lola and invested in Hopper and recently relaunched its travel site powered by Hopper. Another competitor U.S. Bancorp bought Will Smith-backed travel platform TravelBank for $200 million in November last year.

From the JPMC investor day presentation these three slides below map out the state of its current business in travel along with its expansion plans.

From the presentation transcript the description as presented on the investor day worth extracting in full:

“Travel has been the center of gravity for our Ultimate Rewards program for a decade and remains the most aspirational lifestyle category for many of our customers. And we partner with some of the most admired brands in the travel industry. Travel is at the center of our card business.

“In terms of U.S. leisure travel $1 in every $4 spent is on a Chase Card and $1 in every $3 spent is by a Chase customer. And the stats for dining are quite similar. But only a small percentage of this spend went through our platform because our assets were not differentiated. But despite that in 2019 we were already a top 15 travel provider.

“We saw an opportunity during the pandemic to own our own destiny in travel and we acquired cxLoyalty a proprietary two-sided travel platform and Frosch itself a top ten leisure travel agency providing us now with the booking engine the content the servicing excellence and the concierge capabilities that our customers should expect. And today we estimate we are a top five US consumer travel provider.

“So a moment on the business case. Along with controlling the customer experience which is everything we now have full ownership economics. We have all of the travel commissions. We will be at scale and cross $10 billion of travel volume on the platform next year with strong underlying growth. And a point of reference the pre-pandemic Ultimate Rewards growth rate was a 26% two-year CAGR. And obviously assuming a continued benign environment we would expect to reach $15 billion of volume by 2025 if not before.

“Our travel business is cash flow positive today. The acquisitions pay back within six years on strong revenue margins. And for context here industry commissions mix dependent are about 10%. And now we’re getting all of that whereas previously we were not. The business will require little marketing expense as we leverage our existing customers and channels reinforced by our loyalty program Ultimate Rewards. And so the net of all of that we expect a net margin of about 5% plus or minus.

And the strategy we will launch ChaseTravel.com with Card customers later this year and then we’re going to open it up to all of our Chase customers. We will deliver distinctive content and experiences and become a full-service travel agency to our small business and premium leisure travelers. And we will introduce those important customers to our strategic partners and so the flywheel begins. So let me bring this to life through our evolving super app and ChaseTravel.com.

“So looking forward here we have 66 million US households including 5 million small business customers. And now we have 4 million Infatuation dining enthusiasts. We’ve got industry-leading products unmatched first party data and a two-sided commerce platform. And our strategy is to expose distinctive content to our broad customer base making Chase the best way to shop pay and borrow. Starting as I said with travel and introducing our customers to key merchants within our platform at scale.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMjgvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svdGV4YXMtYmFua3MtZ3VuLWxhdy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Texas Law That Has Banks Saying They Don't 'Discriminate' Against Guns (Published 2022),"Four years ago JPMorgan Chase joined some of the nation’s largest banks in publicly distancing itself from the firearm industry after a mass shooting in Parkland Fla. left 17 people dead.

JPMorgan’s relationships with gunmakers “have come down significantly and are pretty limited” Marianne Lake then the bank’s chief financial officer told reporters. “We do have robust risk management practices and policies associated with this” she said.

The bank along with Citigroup and other Wall Street firms did not completely shut the door on gun companies.

In a letter sent to the Texas attorney general this month JPMorgan the nation’s largest bank signaled its willingness to continue working with the firearm industry. The letter described the bank’s “longstanding business relationships” with the industry in the state noting that it “anticipates continuing such relationships into the future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkYmFuay5vcmcvZW4vbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlLzIwMjIvMDUvMjcvZGppYm91dGktbmV3LWZpbmFuY2luZy10by1zdHJlbmd0aGVuLWhlYWx0aC1hbmQtbnV0cml0aW9uLXNlcnZpY2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Djibouti: New Financing to Strengthen Health and Nutrition Services,"WASHINGTON May 29 2022 — The World Bank on May 26 approved US$19.5 million in financing from the International Development Association (IDA) to improve reproductive maternal neonatal child adolescent health and nutrition services for the whole population of Djibouti including refugees and host communities and help the Djiboutian government integrate refugees into the national health system.

Despite significant efforts by Djibouti to improve health service delivery communicable diseases and maternal and child malnutrition are among the leading causes of death with an estimated 58 out of 1000 children never reaching their fifth birthday. The maternal mortality rate of 248 per 100000 live births is almost five times the regional average.

The Djibouti Health System Strengthening Project aims to improve national health services in order to strengthen community resilience to health risks including those related to the country’s hot climate and harsh environment. The project builds on the achievements of previous health operations focusing on optimizing health care services particularly for the most vulnerable and in underserved areas.

""Increasing women and children’s access to better health services by focusing on a stronger health system is a key priority and an important element of our development strategy"" said Ahmed Robleh Abdilleh Djibouti’s Minister of Health. ""The new project aims to reach more vulnerable communities and those most in need. Building the capacity to deliver quality neonatal and child health care is critical for poverty reduction in Djibouti.""

The project’s activities involve the rehabilitation of health facilities—particularly those with comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care—and creating incentives for health service improvement at all levels. Activities also include engaging citizens and communities strengthening the capacity of institutions critical to maternal and child health and nutrition and encouraging positive behavior change. The project will directly benefit women of childbearing age adolescents newborns and children under five years old.

""The Government of Djibouti is committed to addressing the increasing health needs of the whole population including refugees"" said Boubacar-Sid Barry World Bank Resident Representative in Djibouti. ""The capacity of health facilities in Djibouti is under strain from COVID-19 and climate-related shocks which are increasing the country’s need for essential health care. The new operation will contribute by improving childcare maternal and newborn services all of which are vital to better health.""

The new financing comprises US$14.5 million in IDA credit and a US$5 million grant from the IDA19 Window for Host Communities and Refugees (WHR). The WHR was created to support countries that host large refugee populations and help them address the long-term development needs of refugee and host communities. Refugees constitute over 2.3% of Djibouti’s population making it one of the countries with the highest refugee population ratios in the world.

Every day it feels like things are becoming more and more expensive. The cost of living is sky rocking across the globe. Airfares are soaring hotels and Airbnb’s are going up by the day and fuel costs are hitting record levels.

Everything seems to be going up. Unfortunately transportation services are no exception. Ride-sharing company Uber has made a lot of changes in recent weeks with the hopes of expanding its business model.

Soon however the cost of ordering an Uber will cost you a lot more than it did a year ago.

When Uber first broke into the market in 2011 it quickly became a rising star in the tech field as well as becoming a favorite app for millions of Americans.

People who commuted for work traveled for business or simply just needed a ride home late at night it seemed like everyone wanted to use Uber – and rightfully so.

It was an ingenious idea that became popular not just because it was convenient but also because it was affordable!

Finally could you get around town without having to pay an arm and a leg. No more heckling with opportunistic taxi drivers for a lower fare. No more waiting outside in the blistering cold hoping you’d get picked up by a taxi.

At last Uber came and seemingly took over the industry by storm – it was what society needed.

And for a while Uber was just that tremendously affordable. Unfortunately it seems like those days are over.

Uber was affordable because it was heavily subsidized by investors but over the course of the past years Uber has consistently lost a significant amount of money including more than $30 billion the five-odd years since the company’s finances became public.

The solution? Higher costs passed on to consumers.

Rides have been getting—and will continue to get—more expensive. Average Uber prices rose 92 percent between 2018 and 2021 according to data from Rakuten; a separate analysis reports an increase of 45 percent between 2019 and 2022.

Both Uber and Lyft have added a surcharge for riders that helps drivers account for high gas prices.

A once rising star in the transportation industry

It isn’t too farfetched to believe that Uber was burning all that investor cash in order to corner the market.

Once it killed off car service taxi cartels and its ride-hail rivals the company would stop charging riders less than it was paying drivers and prices would have to go up.

This week an Uber from Manhattan to JFK Airport was $100—nearly double the fixed yellow cab rate. But take a guess how long it’ll take you to find a yellow cab.

The fundamental problem Uber and Lyft keep running into is that most people are not willing to pay the fares it would cost to run a profitable taxi service with the overhead Uber and Lyft require.

At the end consumers are the ones who are suffering

Uber fares are at a record high with no end in sight. What once was a convenient and affordable way to get around town turned into something a lot more expensive and burdensome for people.

For years we were made to believe that one can take a 20-minute drive and only pay $7 for it.

Clearly that is no longer than case and consumers will have to take a very hard look at whether or not they’re willing to pay the price for Uber now and in the future.

From testing headphones to reviewing albums our experts aim to create reviews you can trust. Find out more about how we review.

When Kreator headlined Bloodstock for the first time last summer many people seemed surprised by how effortlessly they conquered such a big occasion. In reality the Germans have been in imperious form for the entirety of this century and their stature and popularity have steadily grown as a result.

As that Bloodstock set proved Kreator are serious heavyweights with a ridiculous number of unstoppable metal anthems. From seminal early bursts of primitive chaos like Flag Of Hate and Pleasure To Kill through to the razor-sharp sophistication of recent crowd-pleasers Satan Is Real and 666 – World Divided frontman Mille Petrozza has always been a great songwriter with an intuitive sense of what works. The fact that he is also one of metal’s certified good guys albeit one armed with a deathless screech that would scythe through any stupor is an added bonus.

With all that in mind Hate Über Alles feels like an important milestone despite being Kreator’s 15th studio record. Well-established as one of Europe’s biggest bands the quartet could easily tread water and get away with it. But from the laugh-out-loud intensity of its title track onwards Hate Über Alles absolutely screams commitment to the cause and to the noble yet visceral art of heavy metal songwriting.

That title track is the perfect starting point. With its ferocious thrash gait and a gargantuan scream-along chorus it’s a perfect encapsulation of Kreator’s ageless powers. Just in case anyone remains unconvinced Killer Of Jesus (again Mille gives great title) repeats the trick delivering another exhilarating extreme metal assault with at least two colossal hooks.

Kreator are on top form at mid-pace too; both Crush The Tyrants and Strongest Of The Strong strike a sublime balance between nails-hard heaviness and melodic finesse with perennially underrated guitarist Sami Yli-Sirniö delivering a particular jaw-dropping solo on the latter. As if to prove how malleable his band’s sound continues to be Mille revels in old-school nostalgia on the Priest-like Become Immortal before delivering the mother of all thrash mini-symphonies on Conquer And Destroy. With ethereal female vocals syncopated tech-death precision and yet another giant chorus Midnight Sun is an instant classic. Demonic Future is every bit as sinister savage and smart as its title suggests.

Another sign that Kreator are feeling invincible Mille’s clean vocals on the otherwise monstrous and haunting Pride Comes Before The Fall are a gentle revelation. Finally the epic cautionary tale of Dying Planet tells us everything we need to know about how fucking pissed off Mille is with the state of the world right now. Closer to symphonic black metal than traditional thrash it’s the perfect pitch-black conclusion to an album created in the midst of global chaos.

One intro 10 genuinely fantastic songs absolutely no fucking about. They may have nothing to prove after nearly four decades of active service but Hate Über Alles proves it anyway. When it comes to hitting the heavy metal nail on the head with maximum conviction Kreator are firmly top of the bill.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnViZXIuY29tL214L2VuL2UvZHJpdmUvc2FuLWFuZHJlcy1jaG9sdWxhLXB1LW14L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Driver jobs in San Andrés Cholula PU - Choose Your Hours,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 406 Client Error: Not Acceptable for url: https://www.uber.com/mx/en/e/drive/san-andres-cholula-pu-mx/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnViZXIuY29tL214L2VuL2UvZHJpdmUvc2FuLWFuZHJlcy1jaG9sdWxhLXB1LW14L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL3d3dy41bmV3c29ubGluZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3JpZGVzaGFyZS1jaGFuZ2VzLWZheWV0dGV2aWxsZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWRpc3RyaWN0LWRpY2tzb24tc3RyZWV0LXViZXItbHlmdC1waWNrdXAtd2Vla2VuZC1zYWZldHkvNTI3LTQxOGQ3ZWU4LTM2M2UtNDIzMS1hZTA3LTM4ZGFkOGZhOWFmOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Changes made to rideshare pickups in Fayetteville area,"The Fayetteville entertainment district will now have designated pickup locations for rideshares.

An Uber cab driver was today arrested by the Assam police for allegedly assaulting a man and trying to ram him with his car over a dispute regarding the payment method for a trip. Two journalists -- Mohd Abuzar Choudhary and Nikita Jain -- said the incident happened while they were travelling in an Uber cab this morning. Their default payment mode on the app was set to online they said and alleged that the driver demanded cash instead and got aggressive when told it wasn't possible to change the payment method once the trip starts. Ms Jain has further alleged that the driver beat up her colleague with a rod and tried to run him over with his car when they said they would file a complaint. She also accused the driver of calling them ""Bangladeshi"".

""We had booked an Uber for Kamakhya in #Guwahati. The online was payment but he wanted cash. He then got aggressive and beat @MohdAbuzarCh with a rod. When we said we will file a complaint he tried to run over my colleague with his car. He also called us Bangladeshi @assampolice"" she tweeted along with a picture of the driver.

The Guwahati Police responded to her tweet asking for details soon after and the Police Commissioner Hardi Singh personally responded to the tweet saying ""action has been initiated"".

Another journalist who says he is friends with Mr Choudhary tweeted a shocking video where the driver can be seen stepping into his car and speeding towards a person who is recording him. The latter swiftly moves out of the way but the vehicle still runs over his foot. The driver then flees the spot.

Uber India responded to the tweet asking for some details and promising ""necessary action"". The company also said that it removed the driver's access to the app.

""What has been described violates Uber's code of conduct and has no place on the platform. We have removed the driver's access to the app and are in touch with the rider to provide assistance. We stand ready to assist law enforcement authorities and have informed the rider that he can avail trip insurance to cover medical expenses"" Uber spokesperson said.

Ms Jain and Mr Choudhary have thanked the police on Twitter for the prompt response and action.

The incident has triggered social media outrage with many demanding strict action against the driver.

""Horrendous! #Guwahati is ashamed of such people who try to fleece or brand anyone racially. Strict action must be taken against such buggers under law of the land. @GuwahatiPol

@Uber_India you have much to do & improve overall driver experience in #Guwahati Please do something"" Twitter user Tituraj said.

The journalist who tweeted the video also demanded the termination of the driver and called on Uber to train their driver-partners on ""tolerant and secular"" practices.

""Glad to see that the driver who assaulted @MohdAbuzarCh has been arrested by @assampolice after our intervention @Uber_India



@Uber now please issue a termination for him and train their partners into tolerant practices"" he tweeted.

There have been widespread complaints from customers regarding cab drivers refusing trips if they are not paid in cash. Users who prefer digital payments link their cab-hailing app accounts directly to their banks via credit/debit cards UPI or other digital wallets. Drivers claim cash is easier for them because of immediate payments instead of weekly ones by app-based ride hailing companies."

Yet I've resisted them for three reasons: they'll drain my bank account appointments last hours and I'm afraid I'll never be able to go back to wearing my lashes au naturel.

I love the concept of waking up with Disney princess eyelashes though so when DIY lash extensions called Lashify hit the scene in 2017 I was intrigued. But it wasn't until years later that a product launch from drugstore brand Kiss inspired me to finally try home lash extensions. The brand's Falscara looks extremely similar to Lashify but is significantly cheaper so I knew I had to put them to the test.

Could this fraction-of-the-price Lashify dupe really deliver the same results as the real thing? I gave both a test drive to find out how they compare — here are my honest Lashify and Falscara reviews and the results I got from each product.

Lashify Control Kit Review

I started with Lashify so I could form my thoughts on the OG first. (It's only polite right?)

The Application

Applying Lashify is a five-step process. You prep your natural lashes with Lashify's pre-cleanser brush a bond (aka glue) onto your lashes like you would mascara adhere the short lash strips piece by piece to the base of the underside of your lashes clamp everything together using a tweezer-like tool then brush on a ""glass"" liquid that seals everything and gets rid of any stickiness. If you want extra hold you can also apply a layer of the bond to the lash strips before setting them in place. (If you're already like ""nope too much work"" then consider this mascara that Amazon reviewers are loving instead.)

Did you catch all that? I didn't get the hang of it until around my third time using them. With practice though I was able to cut the whole process down to 10 minutes. Once I got the hang of applying the lashes riiiight up against — but not on — my top lid's waterline it was a cinch. (

Lashify

The Perks

Even though it took a second to fine-tune my technique I preferred Lashify to regular strip lashes from the get-go. With strips I've never been able to master getting them right up against my lashes. Since Lashify is applied to the underside of lashes there's no noticeable black band (which I always feel the need to camouflage with copious amounts of eyeliner). The biggest difference though is how light they feel once they're on. I'd forget I was even wearing them — but I looked like I'd been blessed with the Disney princess lashes of my dreams.

The Downsides

As easy as they are to apply I haven't had luck with getting the lashes to stay put overnight. Lashify is intended to last up to seven days which was a huge draw in the first place. I've tried sleeping with them on (both with and without an eye mask) but I've always woken up the next morning with at least one piece looking wonky. I did manage to keep them on for a week but each morning I needed to reapply any loose pieces rather than starting fresh.

That had me wondering whether sleeping in lash extensions might cause unnecessary tugging on my natural lashes especially in light of the potential hazards associated with professional lash extensions (!!). To find out whether Lashify or similar options applied to the underside of the lash can do damage I called up Jennifer Tsai O.D. a VSP network doctor.

While she didn't call for avoiding them altogether professional and DIY eyelash extensions both have pros and cons noted Tsai. With both ""it's possible to disrupt natural lash growth if not applied correctly with extreme caution and care"" she says. Ideally you'd cycle between periods of wearing them and giving your lashes a break she adds.

And for hygiene reasons wearing DIY lashes overnight is not a practice recommended by Tsai. ""When you're attaching it to the base of your lashes as the day goes on (with pollution in the air and the environment) and your eye creates oil and protein buildup it does catch underneath the base of your lashes. If you don't clean it thoroughly you can end up with styes blepharitis and sometimes eye infections"" she explains Those are all ramifications I'd rather avoid so my plan is to wear them on and off and always carefully remove them at the end of the day. (

Kiss Falscara Review

After my conversation with Dr. Tsai I was ready to move on to Kiss Falscara which isn't intended for overnight wear anyway. Whereas Lashify lashes are single-use (but can be kept on for up to seven days) Falscara can be reused up to three times (but you take them off at the end of each day).

Kiss

Buy It: Kiss Falscara Starter Kit $20 cvs.com

The Application

The process was familiar — apply bond place lashes apply seal — and I was able to apply them with the same ease as Lashify. The lashes themselves felt slightly flimsier and the glue less strong but since I wasn't attempting to batten down the hatches for a week it was no biggie. (

The Perks

I wore them for a day and the lashes didn't budge even when I bumped them while putting on a VR device. (Don't ask.) I went with the ""lengthening"" style which is on the long and wispy side. Were they any longer they'd look startling without eyeshadow on.

The Downsides

Falscara's one major shortcoming is its tweezer tool which can't curve around your eye and secure everything in place the way Lashify's does. In the end I got by with my fingers and the Falscara tweezers but the process wasn't as seamless.

My bare lashes. Lashify ""Amplify"" lashes. Kiss Falscara in ""Lengthening"". My bare lashes. Lashify ""Amplify"" lashes. Kiss Falscara in ""Lengthening"".

The Final Verdict

The glaring difference between the two products is the buy-in price. (Note: Both Lashify's $21 remover and Kiss' $7 remover are sold separately.)

Lashify's Control Kit is $145 and includes black and clear bond glass two sets of lashes and the application tool. That's close to what you'd pay for a professional lash extension application which most Lashify reviews are quick to point out. Lashify also offers flexible weekly biweekly monthly and bimonthly memberships with discounts. A monthly supply of three sets of lashes lash prep bond and seal would set you back just over $100.

Kiss' Falscara Starter Kit is $20 and includes tweezers bond seal and one set of lashes. After the initial cost of the starter kit though the two products are a lot closer in price. A Falscara bond and seal costs $10 and replacement eyelashes are $7. If you were to buy a bond and seal and enough lashes for every day of the month you'd spend about $80 which should be noted in all Falscara reviews.

All things considered I fully intend to use Lashify and Kiss Falscara for special occasions. And since I already shelled out the cash for both I plan to use Lashify's superior tweezers. (I haven't found another pair of curved tweezers that's as rounded. If you do holler.) When I need to replenish my lashes and adhesive I'll save a few bucks by going with Falscara.

If you're unsatisfied with traditional falsies but don't want pro extensions both products are worth trying — the one you pick will depend on how much you're willing to shell out.

The exclusion of oil means you’re less likely to get clogged pores or a breakout. Unlike oil-based products coverage from oil-free foundations will feel more feather light and breathable. But not to worry — they’re actually equally as effective in the coverage department. The best oil-free foundations “generally are more matte or natural looking and help to reduce natural oil [production] from the skin” explains celebrity makeup artist Lisa Aharon to TZR.

Oil-free formulas are a particularly good choice during the hot summer months when makeup has a tendency to melt right off. “I love a good glow as much as the next person but it’s nice to control it” adds Aharon. Another noteworthy feature of an oil-free formula is that it really helps to eliminate the need for a setting powder. These drier formulas also tend to have more lasting power meaning you won’t have to go back and reapply throughout the day (like you might have to with a dewier oil-based one). “The less tending to my face (or any face) for excess shine the better” says the pro.

What Makes A Good Oil-Free Foundation?

When it comes to selecting the right oil-free foundation you want something that’s going to give you your desired coverage something that’s going to stay put and something that won’t further agitate any existing skin conditions. As you're perusing your options make sure to read the ingredient lists. “The only way you can tell if a formula is oil free is if it’s written on the product. It usually says oil free non-comedogenic” says Dr. Debra Jaliman Board Certified NYC Cosmetic Dermatologist and author of ‘Skin Rules’.

Some formulas will say right there on the bottle that it’s oil free but a lot of times it’s not as obvious. You might have to actually read through the entire list to find your answer — some ingredients like sunflower seed oil or coconut oil should be red flags while other labeled ‘extract’ might be a bit more nuanced. Be especially careful to look out for and avoid foundations with essential oils hidden in the formula as they can be especially irritating for acne prone skin. Some options are almost completely natural while others are filled with synthetic ingredients. What works for you might not work for someone else — that’s why it’s imperative to test out a few options yourself.

So if a clean matte look (that continues to absorb oil and reduce shine as you wear it) sounds good to you shop the best oil-free foundations below.

Why Trust Us?

From hair serums and oils to dry shampoos and treatment masks the haircare aisles are looking a bit crowded nowadays. But all of these products serve distinct purposes for helping you achieve your best hair ever. And while many of these items offer their own unique scent the primary goal often lies elsewhere. Enter: hair perfumes—an essential for keeping hair smelling lovely while maintaining optimal hair health.

“Hair perfumes are made for the hair and to make hair smell better whether after a workout a night out or just because someone might want fresher smelling strands” says Manabu Unno Stylist at Salon Yoshiko at Bergdorf Goodman. “They are meant to leave a refreshing lasting scent without damaging hair.”

Although most beauty aficionados are keen on smelling great one might wonder why a standard perfume wouldn’t cut it for hair too. Fair enough. While both products boast a beautiful scent there are key differences between perfumes formulated for the body and for the hair. It basically comes down to the amount of ethyl alcohol and water in the product. “Hair perfumes will only contain traces of alcohol to not dry out hair” explains Rashuna Durham amika Lead Pro Educator and stylist. “Hair perfumes for the most part are quite lightweight and do not weigh hair down like regular perfume or hair oil.”

There are so many beautifully scented and well formulated hair perfumes on the market and it can be a fun experience to choose one that pairs well with scents you already wear on your body. Blending hair perfume with body perfume will help create your own unique signature scent that will have others asking “what are you wearing?” all day long.

New York CNN —

It’s another chaotic holiday weekend for those traveling by air this Memorial Day.

Upwards of 6000 global flights have been canceled since Friday with hundreds more fights delayed according to flight tracking website FlightAware.

Some 1640 flights were canceled on Sunday alone FlightAware data indicates with more than 500 of those flying within into or out of the US. On Monday morning there were already 1228 cancellations including more than 300 flights traveling within into or out of the US.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) is heavily affected by the cancellations with more than 500 domestic and international flights flights axed on Saturday Sunday and Monday.

The carrier blamed Saturday’s cancellations on bad weather and “air traffic control actions” that took place on Friday saying it is trying to preemptively cancel flights at least 24 hours in advance.

Delta canceled 121 flights on Monday representing 4% of its operations. American Airlines canceled 117 flights on Monday or 3% of its operations.

Delta said in an online post that it will issue travel waivers for those affected by bad weather in the Southeast and Northeast this weekend. The most affected airports which include the New York City and Washington DC areas are listed on the company’s website.

AAA estimated 3 million Americans would be traveling by air over the weekend.

On Thursday Delta announced it was decreasing its summer flight schedule. From July 1 through August 7 the airline said it would cut around 100 daily flights primarily in the US and Latin America.

“More than any time in our history the various factors currently impacting our operation — weather and air traffic control vendor staffing increased COVID case rates contributing to higher-than-planned unscheduled absences in some work groups — are resulting in an operation that isn’t consistently up to the standards Delta has set for the industry in recent years” said Chief Customer Experience Officer Allison Ausband in an online post.

Separately JetBlue said it would cut 8% to 10% of its summer schedule. Alaska Airlines reduced its schedule by about 2% through June to match “pilot capacity.”

Moscow has clashed with Big Tech over content censorship data and local representation in a simmering dispute that has erupted into a full-on information battle since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Russia fined Google 3 million roubles ($46540) last year for not storing the personal data of Russian users in databases on Russian territory and on Friday said it had opened a new case over what it called Google’s repeated failure to comply with Russian legislation.

Google which declined to comment could be fined between 6-18 million roubles Roskomnadzor said.

The regulator also said it had opened cases against six other companies – Airbnb Pinterest Likeme Twitch Apple and United Parcel Service – for alleged first-time offences carrying a potential fine of 1-6 million roubles.

Likeme could not be reached while the other five companies had no immediate comment.

In the interim the Berlin Conn. native boosted his resume with a fifth-place finish in the NASCAR Xfinity Series’ Alsco Uniforms 300 at Charlotte Motor Speedway Saturday (May 28).

Preece’s finishing position was no fluke as he was running toward the front in his No. 5 Hunt Brothers Pizza Ford throughout the race finishing seventh in stage one and fifth in stage two.

The performance marked the second NXS race of the year for Preece a substantial improvement over his 16th-place showing at Richmond Raceway back in April.

Afterward the veteran remained positive but was not entirely satisfied with his performance.

“We just didn’t have what it took” Preece told TSJSports’ Peter Stratta post-race. “I think we ended up where I feel like we probably should have maybe a spot or two more but ultimately proud of these guys and the top five.”

5th-place finisher @RyanPreece_ talks about changing track conditions all race long especially with the resin in the higher lanes. Preece will try and make it 3 strong races from Charlotte tomorrow. #NASCAR pic.twitter.com/k33421nh76 — Peter Stratta (@peterstratta) May 28 2022

After losing his Cup Series seat with JTG Daugherty Racing following the 2021 season Preece is spending 2022 as a stand-by driver for Stewart-Haas Racing while making a handful of starts across all three of NASCAR’s top series.

They’ve come with varying degrees of success. In the Camping World Truck Series Preece has posted a best finish of third in five starts for David Gilliland Racing a team he won with at Nashville Superspeedway in 2021. In his lone Cup Series start of 2022 Preece settled for 25th piloting the No. 15 United Rentals Ford for Rick Ware Racing at Dover Motor Speedway.

This weekend at Charlotte Preece is pulling triple duty. He finished a disappointing 11th in the Truck Series race after crashing late in the No. 17 Ford for DGR while battling Carson Hocevar in the No. 42 Chevrolet of Niece Motorsports for the lead. Preece is also slated to start in the Coca-Cola 600 making his second effort of the season running the No. 15 for Rick Ware Racing.

On Saturday Preece was not the only one who benefitted from his fifth-place run. For BJ McLeod Motorsports which fields the Nos. 5 55 78 and 99 in NXS it was only their third top-five finish ever in series competition and their first since Kevin Harvick drove their car to a fourth-place result at Circuit of the Americas last year.

Preece’s success is just the latest example of how a former Cup driver can drop down and help a lower-tier NXS program. Cole Custer won at Auto Club Speedway in the No. 07 Ford for SS Green Light Racing earlier this year while Tyler Reddick went to victory lane last week at Texas in the No. 48 Chevrolet for Big Machine Racing.

Time will tell if Preece’s successful 2022 part-time rides can lead to a successful 2023 opportunity. For now he’s simply making the best of the opportunities laid out in front of him.

Oral diseases are among the most common noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide. While largely preventable there were estimated to be more than 3.5 billion cases of oral diseases and other oral conditions globally in 2019. Oral health varies over the life course from early life to old age is integral to general health and supports individuals in participating in society and achieving their potential.



The global strategy sets the bold vision of universal health coverage (UHC) for oral health reaching all individuals and communities by 2030. This enables people to enjoy the highest attainable state of oral health and live healthy and productive lives including by tackling social and commercial determinants and risk factors of oral diseases and conditions.



The global strategy is the first concrete step towards the full implementation of last year’s WHA74.5 resolution on oral health. With actions for WHO Member States international partners civil society and the private sector the strategy sets four overarching goals to guide Member States to:

develop ambitious national responses to promote oral health

reduce oral diseases other oral conditions and oral health inequalities

strengthen efforts to address oral diseases and conditions as part of UHC

consider the development of targets and indicators based on national and subnational contexts building on WHO guidance to prioritize efforts and assess the progress made by 2030

These goals will require following a set of guiding principles: taking a public health approach; integrating oral health with primary health care; and adopting innovative workforce models to respond to population needs. Placing people at the heart of oral health services is critical including through tailored interventions across the lifecourse and optimizing digital technologies.



In addition the strategy includes six strategic objectives on oral health governance oral health promotion and oral disease prevention the health workforce oral health care oral health information systems and oral health research agendas.



Milestones for the WHO Secretariat are also established. By 2023 WHO will translate the strategy into an action plan for public oral health. This will include a monitoring framework for tracking progress with measurable targets to be achieved by 2030. By 2024 WHO will recommend cost-effective evidence-based oral health interventions as part of the updated Appendix 3 (also known as the ‘best buys’) to the NCD Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs and the WHO UHC Compendium.



WHO will also continue to update technical guidance to ensure safe and uninterrupted dental care. This includes scaling and sustaining innovative practices using digital technologies and supporting Member States’ effort to include Noma in a planned WHO review process to consider the classification of additional diseases within the road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021-30.



Work will also focus on strengthening oral health information systems. This includes creating a new oral health data platform developing standardized data-gathering technologies and methods and creating oral health indicators for population health surveys. Together these action will monitor the progress of implementation of work on oral health while also providing timely and relevant feedback to decision-makers at the national level.



“Oral health is a fundamental right. It is very concerning that despite burdening billions of people around the world many oral diseases which could be prevented or treated with simple evidence-based and cost-effective interventions. People continue to experience pain and suffering alongside severe financial pressures on families and communities.



The impact of poor oral health around the world is enormous and action is urgently needed to benefit all young and old across the lifecourse” said Dr Bente Mikkelsen Director for Noncommunicable Diseases World Health Organization.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkYmFuay5vcmcvZW4vbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlLzIwMjIvMDUvMjcvZGppYm91dGktbmV3LWZpbmFuY2luZy10by1zdHJlbmd0aGVuLWhlYWx0aC1hbmQtbnV0cml0aW9uLXNlcnZpY2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Djibouti: New Financing to Strengthen Health and Nutrition Services,"WASHINGTON May 29 2022 — The World Bank on May 26 approved US$19.5 million in financing from the International Development Association (IDA) to improve reproductive maternal neonatal child adolescent health and nutrition services for the whole population of Djibouti including refugees and host communities and help the Djiboutian government integrate refugees into the national health system.

Despite significant efforts by Djibouti to improve health service delivery communicable diseases and maternal and child malnutrition are among the leading causes of death with an estimated 58 out of 1000 children never reaching their fifth birthday. The maternal mortality rate of 248 per 100000 live births is almost five times the regional average.

The Djibouti Health System Strengthening Project aims to improve national health services in order to strengthen community resilience to health risks including those related to the country’s hot climate and harsh environment. The project builds on the achievements of previous health operations focusing on optimizing health care services particularly for the most vulnerable and in underserved areas.

""Increasing women and children’s access to better health services by focusing on a stronger health system is a key priority and an important element of our development strategy"" said Ahmed Robleh Abdilleh Djibouti’s Minister of Health. ""The new project aims to reach more vulnerable communities and those most in need. Building the capacity to deliver quality neonatal and child health care is critical for poverty reduction in Djibouti.""

The project’s activities involve the rehabilitation of health facilities—particularly those with comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care—and creating incentives for health service improvement at all levels. Activities also include engaging citizens and communities strengthening the capacity of institutions critical to maternal and child health and nutrition and encouraging positive behavior change. The project will directly benefit women of childbearing age adolescents newborns and children under five years old.

""The Government of Djibouti is committed to addressing the increasing health needs of the whole population including refugees"" said Boubacar-Sid Barry World Bank Resident Representative in Djibouti. ""The capacity of health facilities in Djibouti is under strain from COVID-19 and climate-related shocks which are increasing the country’s need for essential health care. The new operation will contribute by improving childcare maternal and newborn services all of which are vital to better health.""

The new financing comprises US$14.5 million in IDA credit and a US$5 million grant from the IDA19 Window for Host Communities and Refugees (WHR). The WHR was created to support countries that host large refugee populations and help them address the long-term development needs of refugee and host communities. Refugees constitute over 2.3% of Djibouti’s population making it one of the countries with the highest refugee population ratios in the world. Around 70% of Djibouti’s refugees are women and children.

During the game Union captain Alejandro Bedoya wore a black-and-white armband with the same message.

The demonstration came in response to the mass shooting at a school in Uvalde Texas on May 24 which left 21 people dead including 19 children.

After the game Bedoya spoke at length in a news conference about an issue on which he has long been a vocal campaigner. Here is the transcript of his remarks edited slightly for clarity.

‘I hugged and kissed my kids’

First Bedoya was asked what it meant to put forth the message that the team did.

I guess the easiest way I could put it is some things are bigger than sports you know? I want to just send my condolences to all those families that are grieving in Uvalde [Texas] and Buffalo [New York] all over this country and whenever these things happen.

As soon as that happened [in Uvalde] it was so hard to process. I was told by my wife who right before dinner that day just broke down in tears. I asked ‘What’s wrong?’ And she told me showed me her phone the headline. And I lost my appetite for dinner right away.

I hugged and kissed my kids held them real close like many other Americans did. And I mean yeah I just can’t fathom what those families are going through and what so many other families go through when dealing with this type of stuff. In the past we’ve done other things you know initiatives to show our support — but also to take a stance.

I think when we talk about American exceptionalism is this truly what it looks like? You know? I mean the statement is you know maybe a bit of hyperbole. You’re never going to end it of course. But I mean there needs to be something done about this. We can’t keep standing idly by just sending thoughts and prayers and seeing words. I’m sure they would have much rather had their kids rather than prayers.

So I continue to pray for them obviously of course. But there needs to be something done with the people in power. We’re considered the — or some folks think — this is the greatest country in the world. Well not with this type of gun violence where we fear for our lives where our kids have to learn how to hide behind desks smear blood on themselves to fake-play dead.

I mean I get so emotional just thinking about what they’re going through. And there’s plenty of solutions where both sides can come to the aisle and just make it harder — to end this type of stuff. And let me tell you something the solution ain’t to arm more teachers. It ain’t more guns. And it’s not to make our schools turn them into prisons. And it’s not fatherlessness. It’s not just mental health.

Sure some of these people are voting against the funding of health insurance and you know universal health care or mental health. This guy in Texas the governor [Greg Abbott] he fought hard to lower the age limit [to buy certain kinds of guns] to 18 in Texas. What does an 18-year-old why does he need to buy assault rifles or an AR-15 an ArmaLite rifle? For what?

You cant even buy a case of beer until you’re 21. Rental car agencies you can’t even rent a car until you’re 25 [without paying extra fees]. But an 18-year-old high school kid can go out and buy a freaking AR-15 two of them and other hand guns and other things and thousands of ammunition [rounds] and stuff like this? Come on man. That’s not right. No.

This ain’t American exceptionalism. It ain’t freedom that we have to now look over our backs all the time.

I went two days ago to a festival around the block in my neighborhood. And just fearing like going scared. Looking around touching people like thinking you know exit strategies — where I can go run out to in case I hear something. And I’m sure many millions of Americans are feeling the same way when they enter a grocery store movie theater place of worship schools.

» READ MORE: Alejandro Bedoya has a history of not sticking to sports

Trying to sell kids freaking bulletproof backpacks. Come on. It’s crazy. People need to stand up and take action. Fund community gun violence intervention programs. There’s a HR-8 bill sitting in the Senate universal background checks which millions of Americans — a majority of Americans — can get behind and support.

Close the ‘Charleston loophole.’ At the federal level red flag laws. I mean there’s so many initiatives that we can support and get behind and get to people in power.

And that’s all we can do with this type of statement you know?

I got the group together. We have a locker room full of international players. My teammates from Norway from British [countries] a Danish guy — you know all over the world. They come here and they can’t fathom they don’t understand the obsession and why these types of mass shootings happen in this country. Why do we have to live like this?

So that’s probably a longer answer than you wanted to hear but I’m sick and tired of having to talk about this man. It [stinks] it’s draining. And [what] we can do as players is just continue to use our platform to advocate for those in power to do something about it take more action. Because what’s there right now it ain’t working.

‘These things are bigger than sports’

Bedoya was then asked what it meant to him that many other teams and players around MLS have stood up this weekend to make statements on this issue.

I think it’s great. I think when you have a group of people coming together to take a stance on something that means more than football you know — there’s people that tell us to shut up and dribble or to stick to soccer or whatever it is. I told you I just said these things are bigger than sports than soccer.

I mean we’re talking about just coming off a week where we saw 19 children gunned down two teachers. It’s disgusting it’s awful terrible! So the human side of us just takes over right? It’s just normal to act this way to have this type of reaction.

And I support all my fellow teammates — you know I guess you can call it like a brotherhood here in this league. I didn’t really speak to anybody else in the league before this. I’m sure in locker rooms everybody you know at workplaces this has obviously been talked about all week right? I mean how can you not talk about it?

» READ MORE: In 2019 Alejandro Bedoya yelled for Congress to ‘end gun violence’ during goal celebration

I have no idea what other teams did. I’m sure I’ll see later you know on social media what other clubs might have done.

But for us it was just simple. I got the group together and I said ‘Look guys.’ They know where I stand on different things. We have an open dialogue in this locker room we’ve created a great culture and we just had a good conversation one morning about what we could do. Open floor open dialogue. Different initiatives were on the table. And that’s what makes this locker room special.

I’m proud to be part of this group. And I didn’t care what anybody else told us. If it was the league or the [Union’s] front office or what anybody would say if they were in or against it. What only mattered was what I felt was what this group discussed and how strong we felt about at least doing this tonight. It was a little bit of our support that we could show and like I said we’re just going to continue using our platform.

‘He gets it done’

Bedoya was then asked who helped order the T-shirts and got the printing done.

I talked to our kit man ‘B’ as we call him [Brandon Comisky the Union’s equipment chief]. I always have a dialogue with him in terms of things that I’d like to do either having an armband or T-shirts or whatever and he gets it done.

So credit to him and [on] such short notice as well because of the turnover. Everybody knows supply chain issues these days is a problem right? He was able to get it done.

Erica [Scheer of the Union’s PR staff] as well; Erica was helpful too. She coordinated with ‘B.’

‘You have to stay optimistic’

Lastly Bedoya was asked how difficult it is to keep up hope and belief that change can be achieved.

Yeah I mean you have to stay optimistic. And like I said I’m always going to continue to use my platform. If you have any heart or any human I guess feelings I mean how does this not hit you so hard? What’s happened in the last couple weeks and beyond?

You know I can’t even tell you the number of mass shootings we’ve already experienced this year — and the level of gun violence that’s affecting all Philadelphians back at the local level as well. Just heartbreaking.

And like I said before our society it can’t continue to live like this. We need real real solutions and things that change and actionable actions initiatives — like now. Not wait a week and 10 days and everything goes back to a little bit of normalcy. And you know all this stuff goes away and it’s the next headline and things like that. Like now. Get something done.

I mean it [stinks] that we always have to keep going back to this. It’s hard to stay positive or to maintain that optimism. But I think with the new generation and everything you know we’ve just got to continue to use our voices and use social media and our platforms to continue to advocate for things to improve. Because as great of a country [as] America is there’s a lot of things that need to improve. And this is a massive massive issue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy51bi5vcmcvZW4vc3RvcnkvMjAyMi8wNS8xMTE5MzAy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UN rights chief concludes China trip with promise of improved relations,"During Saturday’s virtual press conference Ms. Bachelet the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights outlined the new opportunities for dialogue between her office and the Chinese authorities that were discussed during the visit which include an annual senior strategic meeting and a working group that will meet in Beijing and Geneva as well as online.

The working group explained Ms. Bachelet will discuss specific thematic areas including development poverty alleviation and human rights minority rights business and human rights counterterrorism and human rights digital space and human rights judicial and legal protection and human rights.

The High Commissioner pointed out that as her Office does not have a presence in China the working group will allow for structured engagement on these and other issues and provide a space for her team to bring specific matters of concern to the attention of the Chinese Government.

Tibet Xinjiang and Hong Kong on the agenda

During her mission Ms. Bachelet spoke with a range of government officials several civil society organisations academics and community and religious leaders. In addition she met several organizations online ahead of the visit on issues relating to Xinjiang province Tibet Hong Kong and other parts of China.

In Xinjiang home to the Muslim Uighur minority Ms. Bachelet raised questions and concerns about the application of counterterrorism and de-radicalisation measures and their broad application and encouraged the Government to undertake a review of all counterterrorism and deradicalization policies to ensure they fully comply with international human rights standards and are not applied in an arbitrary and discriminatory way.

On the Tibet Autonomous Region Ms. Bachelet reiterated the importance of protecting the linguistic religious and cultural identity of Tibetans and allowing Tibetans to participate fully and freely in decisions about their religious life and for dialogue to take place.

Regarding Hong Kong Ms. Bachelet urged the Government to nurture – and not stifle – the tremendous potential for civil society and academics in Hong Kong to contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights. She described the arrests of lawyers activists journalists and others under the National Security Law as “deeply worrying” and noted that Hong Kong is due to be reviewed by the UN Human Rights Committee in July.

“To those who have sent me appeals asking me to raise issues or cases with the authorities - I have heard you” she declared. “I will continue to follow up on such issues and instances of concern on a sustained basis”.

‘China has a very important role to play’

The rights chief praised China’s “tremendous achievements” in alleviating poverty and eradicating extreme poverty 10 years ahead of its target date.

The country she added has gone a long way towards ensuring protection of the right to health and broader social and economic rights thanks to the introduction of universal health care and almost universal unemployment insurance scheme.

A number of other developments in the country were welcomed by Ms. Bachelet including legislation that improves protection for women’s rights and work being done by NGOs to advance the rights of LGBTI people people with disabilities and older people.

The UN rights chief underscored the important role that China has to play at a regional and multilateral level and noted that everyone she met on her visit from Government officials civil society academics diplomats and others demonstrated a sincere willingness to make progress on the promotion and protection of human rights for all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA1LzI4LzIxODQxODYvc2luLXRheGVzLWZ1bmRpbmctaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtc29jaWFsLXNlcnZpY2Vz0gFnaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGhpbHN0YXIuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDUvMjgvMjE4NDE4Ni9zaW4tdGF4ZXMtZnVuZGluZy1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1zb2NpYWwtc2VydmljZXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Sin taxes’ funding health care social services,"‘Sin taxes’ funding health care social services

“Through Republic Act 10351 or the Sin Tax Reform Law of 2012 we restructured the excise tax on tobacco and alcohol products” Socioeconomic Planning chief Karl Chua said.

MANILA Philippines — The government’s move to impose sin taxes on alcohol tobacco e-cigarettes and sugar-sweetened beverages has enabled the country to fund the Universal Health Care program and provide social services during the pandemic according to the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).

Socioeconomic Planning chief Karl Chua shared the country’s experience in pushing for excise taxes during the 75th World Health Assembly event on “The Role of Civil Society in Advancing Fiscal Policies for Public Health.”

Chua said the sin taxes have helped fund the Universal Health Care Law which seeks to give all Filipinos access to quality and affordable health care services.

Efforts on sin tax reforms have started since the previous administration.

“Through Republic Act 10351 or the Sin Tax Reform Law of 2012 we restructured the excise tax on tobacco and alcohol products” Chua said.

Under the current administration he said the Philippine government pursued the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP) for a simpler fairer and more efficient tax system.

This included the passage of Package 1 or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Law of 2018 which increased taxes on tobacco products and introduced a sweetened beverage tax.

The government further increased taxes on tobacco and alcohol products and imposed a new tax on e-cigarettes through Package 2+.

The move was undertaken as previous hikes were found insufficient to curtail consumption.

Through the CTRP Chua said the government was able to fund billions of emergency cash transfers procure millions of life-saving vaccines as well as pour in more investments in health and social services amid the pandemic.

“Our experience has highlighted the strong interplay between fiscal policies and social interventions. We fought hard to enact these game-changing tax reforms and now we are seeing their benefits” he said.

“We remain confident that the bold policies we have instituted over the past six years will further drive our economy forward and help improve the lives of the people” he added."

Lleva ya 3 años despejando el ruedo de Las Ventas cada tarde bueno sin contar con el obligado parón de la pandemia.

Rocío debutó en Las Ventas el jueves 1 de agosto de 2019 “en la final del Certamen de Novilladas nocturnas” nos dice ella misma y aunque como señala “ya son algunos años”. Antes de estrenarse en la Monumental madrileña Rocío ya había desempeñado esta función en “bastantes pueblos de la Comunidad de Madrid con la cuadra de picar de Madrid”.

“Desde los 15 años” nos cuenta “trabajaba en Las Ventas repartiendo los programas de mano” hasta que un día “se me presentó la oportunidad de que uno de los alguacilillos en principio iba a coger una baja; y yo hablé con la empresa para proponerles que por qué no una primera mujer alguacililla. Y la verdad es que a la empresa le pareció una gran idea y así es como tiró para adelante la idea de una primera mujer alguacililla”.

Audio Rocío López recuerda el día que debutó en Las Ventas como alguacililla





Así es como el sueño de esta joven aficionada se cumplió una noche de verano que recuerda “con mucha ilusión y ganas” tantas que como nos cuenta cuando se dirigía a la plaza de toros “iba gritando porque estaba súper contenta”. Un día en el que “la gente no se esperaba –que ella fuera alguacililla- y no sabíamos cómo iban a reaccionar y reaccionaron con muchos aplausos” recuerda emocionada Rocío que asegura que Las Ventas “es una plaza muy agradecida”.

Aunque esta joven ya conocía las Ventas sus tendidos su afición… asegura que “impone sobre todo cuando la ves llena y estás allí abajo” y confiesa que “el murmullo de la gente me recuerda mucho sonido del mar”.

Además aquella noche también pudo entregar la primera oreja a uno de los novilleros “fue a Tomás Rufo –ganador del Certamen de Novilladas nocturnas y que esta Feria de San Isidro 2022 ha salido por la Puerta Grande de Las Ventas el día de su confirmación ante toros de Garcigrande- y aunque a mí no me tocaba hacerlo mi compañero Fran me cedió el privilegio de hacerlo por ser mi debut como alguacililla en esta plaza”.

Rocío es una gran aficionada a los toros “que me han inculcado desde pequeña llevándome a las plazas de toros y en mi pueblo hay una ganadería chiquitita y me llevaban allí ver los toros”. Y ahora Rocío vive de sus pasiones porque “es mundo que siempre me ha llamado la atención tanto los toros como los caballos”.





¿QUÉ DEBE SABER UN ALGUACILILLO?





Define la RAE el término alguacil como el “agente ejecutivo que está a las órdenes del presidente en las corridas de toros”. Y alguacilillocomo “cada uno de los dos alguaciles que en las plazas de toros preceden a la cuadrilla durante el paseo y uno de los cuales recibe la llave del toril de manos del presidente y queda luego a sus órdenes durante la corrida”.

Pero ¿qué es lo que debe saber hacer un alguacilillo? Lo primero y fundamental “saber montar a caballo” porque como bien señala Rocío “el caballo es un animal impredecible por lo que tiene que saber reaccionar ante bastantes imprevistos como puede ser una bolsa que salga volando y el animal se asuste o que tenga un mal día y se ponga a botar entonces yo creo que lo principal es saber montar a caballo”.

Otra de las cosas que debe conocer un alguacilillo es “el reglamento de una plaza de toros sobre todos si es de una plaza de primera como Las Ventas que tiene mucha importancia” y por último y no menos importante “también hay que saber dónde colocarte en un callejón porque claro luego también que saber que un toro puede saltar al callejón y tienes que saber guardarte”.

LAS FUNCIONES DE UN ALGUACILILLO

La primera función de un alguacilillo es el despeje de la plaza que como bien nos recuerda López “actualmente es algo más estético pero antiguamente la gente estaba en la plaza de toros en el ruedo y se hacía despejar la zona. Una vez que ya ha terminado el despeje y llevas a los toreros a la presidencia tu función es hacer junto con los delegados que se cumpla el reglamento dentro del ruedo”.

Y nos explica Rocío otra de las funciones que tiene y que quizás sea de la menos conocida que es guardar el orden en el callejón es decir “el callejón ha de ser una zona neutral no se pueden sacar pañuelos ni ponerse a dar voces a un torero como si se estuviese en el tendido o en las gradas. Tiene que ser unas zona muy basada en el respeto” dice Rocío. Además aunque ellos no tienen potestad para proponer a alguien para una sanción por infringir estas normas sí que pueden hablar “con los delegados y ellos deciden si es preciso proponerlo o no para sanción”.

Audio





Y por supuesto la entrega de los trofeos a los toreros. Al término de cada faena si uno de los matadores recibe como premio una oreja es función del alguacilillo entregar ese trofeo al diestro. Apenas son unos minutos los que están juntos alguacil y torero en el ruedo si acaso el tiempo justo para que el primero de la enhorabuena al diestro y éste se lo agradezca. A su agradecimiento pocas son las veces que intercambian algo más que esas palabras o simplemente gestos Pero sí que durante el festejo hay tiempo para poder hablar con los actuantes o con quienes se encuentran en el callejón.

El trabajo del alguacil termina una vez que termina la corrida que es cuando ya se cambian en los vestuarios de la plaza y hasta el día siguiente. Eso sí como nos cuenta Rocío “cada tarde llegamos dos horas y media o tres horas antes porque tenemos que preparar a los caballos: le damos cuerda les bañamos les ensillamos… Y luego ya nos vestimos nosotros” porque como manda la tradición van vestidos con el típico traje de alguacil “que te lo tienen que hacer a medida y mano entonces sí que sale caro” costeárselo.

Esta joven alguacililla sigue yendo por los pueblos y su papel en Las Ventas está garantizado por años porque como nos dice “una vez que has entrado te quedas”. Así que Ddios mediante serán muchas las tardes que veamos salir por la puerta de cuadrillas subida a su caballo y ataviada con su traje de alguacilillo a nuestra protagonista Rocío López primera alguacililla en Las Ventas.

El pasado 14 de mayo previo al día de San Isidro el programa 'Agropopular' que dirige César Lumbreras se desplazó al ruedo de Las Ventas para emitir desde allí de 8:30 a 10h. Esa mañana Rocío López fue una de las protagonistas junto al ganadero de Victoriano del Río y Toros de Cortés Ricardo del Río; y Rosana Galán veterinaria y cuidadora de la cuadra del rejoneador Sergio Galán.

Y es que los padres en Estados Unidos están haciendo cualquier cosa para mantener a sus hijos a salvo y eso significa invertir en este tipo de productos.

El exagente del Servicio Secreto Mike De Geus fundador y director ejecutivo de Leatherback Gear explicó a TMZ que su empresa ha visto un considerable aumento del 800% en las ventas pocos días después de la masacre en Uvalde.

De Geus que trabajó con los ex presidentes Donald Trump Barack Obama George Bush y Bill Clinton cuando era agente del Servicio Secreto asegura que sus mochilas ofrecen la misma cantidad de blindaje antibalas que los modelos que él tenía cuando protegía a los mandatarios estadounidenses.

Según el citado medio la mayoría de los interesados llegan buscando la mochila Sport One Jr. con un precio de 250 dólares (unos 233 euros) que se separa en dos piezas creando un chaleco antibalas en apenas segundos cubriendo la parte frontal y la espalda de quien la utilice.

Otro fabricante de mochilas a prueba de balas es TuffyPacks desde donde indican también que están experimentando un aumento notable en las ventas de armadura que pueden ir dentro de cualquier bolso.

Hace un año Aefecc presentaba un balance positivo de ventas cercano al 20% provocado por los cambios de hábitos durante la pandemia y el mayor número de horas que los españoles pasamos en casa. La necesidad de actualizar elementos del hogar hizo crecer la demanda de chimeneas y estufas.





En los últimos meses ante la crisis de abastecimiento energético y el alza de los precios de la luz el gas y el gasoil generada por la distribución del mercado eléctrico y la guerra en Ucrania Aefecc que representa a un sector que genera casi 4000 empleos directos con una facturación de más de 100 millones de euros presenta unos datos de incremento de ventas alrededor del 30%.





Ante una de las mayores crisis energéticas en Europa los fabricantes de chimeneas y estufas destacan los beneficios económicos y ambientales que pueden aporta la leña y el pellet que constituyen “un gran olvidado en el mercado español de la energía”.





Beneficios económicos y ambientales

“En un país como España con más del 50% de superficie de bosque y matorral tenemos un gran recurso energético desaprovechado la leña. Su aprovechamiento puede suponer una alternativa importante al consumo de gas y electricidad en los hogares como fuente de suministro de calor para nuestros hogares” afirma el presidente de Aefecc Carlos Olivan.





Además de contribuir a una mayor autonomía y diversificación energética en un momento en el que la crisis en Ucrania ha desequilibrado los precios de la luz y el gasoil el uso de la leña “también puede contribuir a disminuir la carga de vegetación seca e inflamable en nuestros bosques y por tanto ayudar a prevenir incendios. Esto es vital en un contexto de subida de las temperaturas olas de calor y periodos de sequía prolongados que hacen que matorrales y vegetación seca de los bosques abandonados sean altamente combustibles” señala Olivan.







El uso de calderas y estufas incluso puede constituir una práctica de economía circular al disminuir la generación de residuos y el impacto ambiental y generar empleos locales en torno al aprovechamiento de productos forestales no maderables (pequeñas maderas piñas púas) y fabricación de pellets. “La evolución técnica de estufas y calderas de leña permiten hacer un uso más eficiente de la misma reduciendo los impactos ambientales de la combustión e incrementando la eficiencia energética en el almacenaje y la propagación de calor” afirma Oliván.





Aunque actualmente el consumo de leña y pellet “ni siquiera está contemplado en los balances energéticos de los planes nacionales de energía” (que centran sus balances en la energía eléctrica nuclear renovable gas petróleo y carbón) su uso se ha mantenido durante décadas en el mundo rural tanto en primeras como en segundas viviendas. “Esto lo saben bien en la España vaciada” destaca Oliván quien pone de manifiesto que “la biomasa favorece la independencia energética tanto de los países como de los hogares garantizando una fuente de energía renovable menos contaminante en el caso de los nuevos equipos que cumplen la normativa europea de “Ecodiseño”. Así con la nueva normativa en vigor puede haber un ahorro de hasta un 40% en leña y emisiones cercanas al cero”.





Según Olivan la escalada de precios del gas según diversos estamentos se situará por encima del 60% al final de año respecto a los días anteriores a la invasión de Ucrania. Y afirma que todo “pese a que Bruselas ha aprobado la propuesta de los gobiernos de España y Portugal para establecer un precio de referencia para el gas de 30 euros el megavatio con el fin de abaratar el precio de la electricidad”.





Frente al alza de los precios del gasoil el gas y la electricidad “el precio de la leña de encina o de roble se mantiene desde hace tiempo entre los 013 €/kg y los 018€/kg e incluso si uno vive en zonas rurales puede incluso tener acceso gratuito a la leña por lo que la opción de la calefacción a través de chimeneas o estufas de leña sigue siendo la más económica” destaca el presidente de Aefecc Carlos Oliván.





La calefacción el gran gasto energético de los españoles

La calefacción supone el 47% del consumo energético de los hogares españoles. En viviendas unifamiliares que suponen el 35% del parque inmobiliario del país esta proporción del consumo energético en calefacción puede elevarse al 64%. La utilización de la biomasa y especialmente la leña supone un consumo ecológico que impulsa el desarrollo en entornos rural y que no requiere procesos industriales de transformación “consumes lo que recoges en el bosque por poner un ejemplo” afirma Oliván.





En Austria por ejemplo la chimenea de leña cerrada y erficiente es la principal fuente de calefacción en los hogares con una cuota de más del 50%. Por eso desde Aefecc se echa en falta un mayor apoyo a la reutilización del excedente de los bosques y los incentivos a la sustitución de sistemas de calefacción provenientes de energías fósiles por estas más ecológicas como son las chimeneas de toda la vida.





En Francia por ejemplo el mercado de chimeneas aumentó en un 80% entre 2002 y 2006 gracias a un incentivo fiscal del 50% sobre la compra de un aparato de calefacción a leña que superara los 65% de rendimiento térmico. Ahora la subvención en Francia es del 30% más un IVA reducido de 55% para chimeneas o estufas de bajas emisiones contaminantes y de más de 70% de eficiencia energética concluyen desde Aefecc.

According to a group of international security experts at Verisk Maplecroft four cities in South Africa are now JOINT-FIRST in their Serious Crime Risk Index.

What are the most dangerous South African cities?

The Cities@Risk Security Index which ranks 579 urban centres with a population over one million on their exposure to a range of threats weighs up a number of factors ranging from ‘terror prospects’ to ‘conflict intensity’.

So it’s perhaps all too gut-wrenchingly familiar that some of South Africa’s largest hubs feature amongst the criminal havens. Verisk Maplecroft have named Cape Town Ekurhuleni Johannesburg and Pretoria at the top of the tree.

It’s particularly concerning for Gauteng given that three of its metros are mentioned. However all of these major municipalities are now considered as some of the most dangerous cities on the planet – contributing to Africa’s cohort of 33 ‘risky regions’.

“The most dangerous cities overall are distributed widely with the top 100 including 33 cities from the Americas 33 from Africa 19 from Asia 14 from the Middle East and one from Europe.” “Outside of the Americas companies operating in South Africa also face the most serious crime risks with Cape Town Ekurhuleni Johannesburg and Pretoria in the group of cities receiving the worst possible score and ranking joint first in the index.” Verisk Maplecroft

‘Warzones and failed states for company’…

It’s not just South Africa in peril though: The warzones of Afghanistan and Ukraine are singled out for their respective terror and security situations with the volatility in Venezuela and lawlessness of Latin America also making the headlines.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Millions of customers will see a $1.35 increase in administrative charges for each voice line beginning in June Bloomberg reported. Verizon representatives also said that business customers will see an “economic adjustment charge” beginning on June 16 as well as mobile phone data plans rising by $2.20 a month and basic service plans going up by 98 cents.

AT&T also raised its prices earlier this month by $6 on single lines and $12 for families.

However these price increases could cause some problems according to a Recon Analytics mobile intender survey. A separate Bloomberg report noted that customer deflections for AT&T could rise to as much as 12% per month from its usual 1%.

Wireless carriers cite the state of the current economy for the price hikes. According to the Labor Department the all items index increased 8.3% year-over-year in April not seasonally adjusted.

“We’re all feeling the pressure and we’ve been in the process of deciding how much of that pressure we can share with our clients” Tami Erwin head of Verizon Business recently told Bloomberg.

Large mobile carriers are also trying to balance higher prices with better service like switching customers from older plans to the new 5G network Bloomberg reported.

They were witnessing nothing less than four of the greatest rappers of all time — Ice Cube Snoop Dogg Too $hort and E-40 — perform onstage at the same time during Day 2 (Saturday May 28) at the BottleRock Napa Valley festival.

“This is Mount Westmore” Oakland rapper Too $hort said to the massive crowd assembled before the festival’s Verizon Stage. “This is the foundation of West Coast hip-hop.”

They would then go about underscoring that claim running through some 90 minutes of hip-hop classics — a number of which rank among the most beloved songs the genre has ever produced.

Ice Cube as he is wont to do stole the show whenever he touched the microphone. The N.W.A legend sounded as strong and fresh as ever as he rolled mightily through such songs as “Check Yo Self.”

Yet every member of the quartet had ample room to shine during the set with Snoop Dogg impressing with “Gin and Juice” Vallejo’s E-40 rocking the crowd with “Tell Me When to Go” and Too $hort cruising through “Gettin’ It.”

The set also included pole dancers and 49ers tight end George Kittle who E-40 a big Niners fan brought on stage near the end of the set. Not surprisingly that brought an NFL rebuttal of sorts from Silver-and-Black loyal Too $hort who then led the crowd in a Raiders chant.

The audience seemed to love every minute of the affair holding their drinks in the air and shouting along to the rhymes. One crowd member even went so far as to perform a Jimmy Page-style air-guitar solo during “Nuthin’ But a G Thang” which might have been a first for that song.

The set closed with “It Was a Good Day” which was a little less amazing than usual since Cube cut the number short — possibly because the group was bumping right up against the festival’s hard 10 p.m. curfew — and leaving this critic without the satisfaction of yelling the lyric “2 in the morning get the Fatburger” at top volume.

Delta Goodrem shines at BottleRock

One other massive highlight from Day 2 was Delta Goodrem. The singer-songwriter-pianist has long been a huge star in her native Australia where she has sold millions of albums and filled arenas with thousands of adoring fans.

Truly if BottleRock was held in Sydney rather than Napa she likely would have topped the bill. Instead Goodrem — who is not all that well known in the U.S. — performed before a few hundred fans on one of the secondary stages somewhat early in the day.

Goodrem would use the showcase to deliver the best set I’ve seen at the 2022 BottleRock Napa Valley festival topping even the masterpiece that mighty Metallica delivered on Day 1. Her voice was amazing — so strong clear and engaging. Her vocal work is comparable to and on par with the likes of Carrie Underwood and even my favorite female country artist Martina McBride.

Yet Goodrem is more than just a premiere vocal talent. She’s the full package as a performer — equally brilliant on the piano engaging the crowd and fronting her sensational band.

During a short interview after the show the singer mentioned to me that it’s been quite a number of years since she last visited the U.S. Let’s hope this BottleRock appearance is the start of something big for Goodrem in the states and that millions of listeners in North American will soon know about this amazingly talented performer."

The legislators pointed out that the Government of Mexico has carried out a series of “attacks and violations” of the Trade Agreement between Mexico the United States and Canada (T-MEC) for which they ask the president to act accordingly.

The above refers to the letter in relation to the suspension of activities of the US mining company Vulcan owner of Calica whose concession in Playa del Carmen was suspended earlier this month by orders of the Mexican Government.

“Vulcan Materials Company is not the only US enterprise to be harassed by the Mexican government and we express our concern about President López Obrador’s anti-business attitude and rhetoric. There have been a number of surprising cases particularly in energy where multiple US-owned facilities have been forced to close” says the document held by El Financiero.

An ‘escalation’ of hostilities

The letter details that for more than 30 years Vulcan Materials Company owner of the Calizas Industriales del Carmen (Calica) mining company operated a concession to extract limestone in Quintana Roo. However in 2018 Vulcan initiated an international arbitration procedure against Mexico whose government prohibited the operation in two of the three fields owned by the US company.

“In January of this year President López Obrador began an escalation of hostilities directly interfering with Vulcan’s ability to export materials and making numerous public statements advocating that Vulcano stop mining” the letter reads.

This is in reference to the fact that on May 5 the Government of Mexico presented Vulcan with closure orders to immediately cease all extraction and quarrying activities in the only active deposit that the mining company had left located in Playa del Carmen Quintana Roo.

The foregoing despite the fact that Vulcan is the owner of the concessions for that deposit and that according to the legislators the mining company has all the necessary permits to operate.

“We write to you urging you to prioritize and address the recent aggression by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and his administration towards US companies with investments and operations in Mexico” the letter states.

“If these violations are allowed to continue they will undermine mutually beneficial economic cooperation between our nations and encourage companies to seek more predictable and suitable markets elsewhere. Therefore we respectfully request that you take immediate action with respect to the Government of Mexico to reverse the harmful measures it has already taken and to prevent further damage to the economic relationship between the United States and Mexico” warns the letter signed by the legislators.

The letter was signed by the senators of the American Union Bill Hagerty Richard Shelby Rick Scott Tommy Tuberville Roger F. Wicker Bill Cassidy Ted Cruz Roger Marshall Marco Rubio and John Cornyn.

Wired2fish’s McKeon Roberts shares a methodical process for targeting big bass in shallow water using realistic weedless swimbaits that mimic shad or bluegill.

Bass and bluegills often co-mingle in shallow water especially in wind-blown pockets where the whole food chain from plankton to predator exists. The bass use cover or structure such as bulrush root balls or wood to hide in ambush. You can effectively fish weedless-rigged swimbaits around cover such as grass and wood a slow and steady retrieve usually works best.

Good Weedless Bluegill Swimbaits

There are a number of good weedless bluegill swimbaits on the market now. We’re fond of the 13 Fishing Coalition Bait Gill the Megabass Dark Sleeper the Savage Gear Pulsetail and the Berkley Gilly are all good options for picking off big bass in grass and vegetation.

Shallow Water Areas for Swimbait Bass

Chris Zaldain shares in the video above some great tips for shallow areas to target with bluegill swimbaits. As pointed out the best areas are going to be shallow backwater areas near or in spawning locations. The best spawning locations will offer solid bottom substrate for making beds and cover to make bass feel more protected. Pockets in the weeds offer lots of cover for spawning bass but can be hard to get conventional lures through without being too obtuse with presentations. A bluegill swimbait is the perfect size and subtle action for picking these bigger feeding bass off effectively.

Look at lake maps for the shallow protected flats and lead in banks with cover for spawning and work out from there. Somewhere along the transition you will find these feeding prespawn females making their way to the spawn areas and back out again afterwards.

Weedless Bluegill Swimbait Gear

A casting reel in the 7.5:1 range is ideal as speed can be easily managed while still having the ability to pull fish from cover. Other important factors for a larger swimbait setup are a longer rod which aids in long casts and driving the heavy gauge hooks. Roberts uses a braided line for hook setting power coupled with a strong 20-pound fluorocarbon leader for invisibility. As the water is shallow the big bait can often spook fish upon entry. Try to land your bait calmly by keeping your trajectory low or bank it off cover to keep the entry cast stealthy.

[Brown University] — What is it like to feel gratitude and grief at the same time? Brown University’s Class of 2022 has some idea.

On Saturday May 28 the graduating seniors packed into the standing-room-only First Baptist Church in America in the midst of Commencement and Reunion Weekend to take part in the Baccalaureate a colorful multi-faith service whose core components date back to the University’s founding.

Much of the event was as happy and celebratory as in years past: There were wide smiles heartfelt hugs peals of laughter and songs and dances filled with pure joy. But many of the performances prayers and speeches made clear that the Class of 2022 wasn’t just prepared to celebrate; they were also prepared to reflect together on the tough times when they didn’t feel like celebrating.

“For some of us a cloud hangs over our party” admitted Sarah Kim a graduating senior from the pulpit of the church where Brown’s graduates have gathered since 1776. “And so we acknowledge grief’s presence — in the faces we had hoped would be here with us today in the experiences we hoped to have before walking out of the gates and in our tear-soaked sleeves as we wave goodbye to people and faces who have come to mean so much to us.”

In a student-led portion of the Baccalaureate program titled “Wisdom from Our Traditions” Kim told her fellow graduates who sat masked in the audience that she felt as if she was standing at an intersection — of gratitude for the first fully in-person Commencement since 2019 and grief from the heartbreaks of the two-year COVID-19 pandemic. But at that uncomfortable intersection she said there are valuable lessons to be gleaned.

“The same secret corners where we cried over setbacks heartbreak and loss were also sites of meaningful accomplishment where we sharpened and comforted each other” she said. “Today we take the time to appreciate the flowers that grew in the concrete. How wonderful it is that we have learned not to take each other or gatherings like these for granted.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhdW50b25nYXpldHRlLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjIvMDUvMjgvY3Jld3MtcmVzcG9uZC01LWFsYXJtLWZpcmUtc3ByaW5nLWxhbmUtdGF1bnRvbi85OTc2MDEwMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local departments respond to early morning 5-alarm fire on Spring Lane in Taunton,"TAUNTON — There was a 5-alarm fire on Saturday at 4 Spring Lane.

An old mill building that neighbors said had been used as a performance space for bands caught fire early Saturday morning sending smoke billowing into the air according to Taunton Daily Gazette's media partner WCVB-TV.

The fire started around 4 a.m. Saturday inside the building on Spring Lane in Taunton. As the fire spread the Taunton Fire Department was forced to evacuate the building the department said in a Saturday afternoon press release.

Six hours later smoke and flames were still billowing from the building.

Neighbors told WCVB's Josh Brogadir that people may have been living in the space though it wasn’t officially housing.

Taunton Fire Lt. Jonathan Nunes told the Boston Globe that there were people living illegally inside the building. Fire officials told the Globe ""many people were forced to flee.""

There were no injuries reported as of Saturday afternoon according to the Taunton Fire Department.

The Raynham Fire Department assisting on the scene told NECN that multiple buildings in the area were at risk.

Firefighters from Berkley Fire and Rescue also helped battle the blaze sharing several photos on their Facebook page while battling what was then a 4-alarm fire. One of the photos showed the fire spreading to some nearby trees.

For most of the morning the blaze was a 4-alarm with a fifth alarm around 11:30 a.m.

Crews continued to put out the flames well into the morning.

Fire could be seen coming out of the roof over J&J Diecast Collectibles as crews worked to keep it contained.

Around 12:30 p.m. they had the fire under control but companies were expected to remain on the scene for several hours to wet down the building.

Sections of downtown were closed to traffic while fire crews battled the blaze.

The Berkley Lakeville Bridgewater Raynham and Rehoboth Fire Departments provided mutual aid at the scene and the North Attleboro Somerset Easton and Norton Fire Departments covered Taunton stations.

Officials are investigating the cause of the fire.

TAUNTON -- Firefighters from multiple towns spent hours putting out a blaze in Taunton Saturday morning. Crews responded to the 29000-square-foot mill building on Spring Lane around 4 a.m.

Heavy smoke and flames were visible upon arrival the Taunton Fire Department said.

Berkley Lakeville Bridgewater Raynham and Rehoboth firefighters helped with the response.

No injuries were reported.

The building was built in 1900. It's location as well as the fire's intensity made the flames difficult to put out.

The cause of the fire is unknown at the time."

But bonds once the first stop on this dash have been left reeling by spiralling inflation and interest rates.

So the search is on for alternative safe havens with some investors resolved to be inventive and have fun.

And as we celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee could companies endorsed by the monarch be worth considering?

You may not be able to invest in all of the winners of the Queen's Awards for Enterprise and companies granted warrants by the Queen and the Prince of Wales.

But the quoted businesses in this coterie of garlanded firms must deliver to the highest of standards whether they are in cereals like Kellogg's (her Majesty is said to have Special K for breakfast) or 'linen drapery and soft furnishings' like Dorma a division of Dunelm.

Coca-Cola is the 'supplier of soft drinks' by appointment to Her Majesty.

Two other warrant holders are Diageo maker of Gordon's and Tanqueray gins and Dubonnet which was once the Queen Mother's favourite tipple and is a part of the Pernod Ricard empire. Brokers believe that the French company's shares are set to sparkle again.

Assessing the viability of an investment based on its House of Windsor connections may seem a frothy approach but opting for quality is tried and tested.

Guy Ellison head of UK equities at Investec Wealth & Investment says: 'The adage that 'form is temporary but class is permanent' is applied to sports people but it is equally relevant when selecting investments.

'In principle investing is relatively straightforward. We should identify the best-quality businesses buy them and then do nothing. In practice the reality is more challenging.

'There are times when long-term quality companies may be out of form. However we will not be turning our backs on such class businesses. They embody many of the attributes recognised by the Queen's Awards for Enterprise including innovation sustainable development and promoting opportunity.'

When deciding if warrant holders are a quality buy it's important to note that impeccable workmanship and stellar returns are not automatically linked.

The Aston Martin DB11 (prices start at £147900) is expertly crafted. But shares in Aston Martin Lagonda 'motor manufacturer and repairer by appointment to Prince Charles' have halved since flotation in 2018.

The John Deere 6R 185 tractor is scarcely a sporty ride but shares in this US-owned agricultural equipment firm are up 2 per cent this year despite supply chain issues. Morgan Stanley rates the company a 'defensive buy'.

Volkswagen and its two subsidiaries Audi UK and Bentley are also warrant holders. Herbert Diess Volkswagen's boss says that by 2025 it will overtake Tesla to become the electrical vehicles global No 1.

Boots is being sold by its US parent Walgreens Boots Alliance. Hopes of a disposal windfall are slim however. Boots valued at £9billion in 2014 may fetch just £5- 6billion in part because its customers face a cost-of-living squeeze.

The affluent clientele of two luxury sector warrant holders – Burberry and Mappin & Webb the jeweller – are likely to be less affected. Shares in Burberry one of the largest holdings at the Lindsell Train UK Equity fund managed by Nick Train should revive when lockdowns ease in China.

Meanwhile Mappin & Webb is a division of Watches of Switzerland the UK retailer benefiting from demand for expensive baubles and for timepieces like Patek Philippe and Rolex.

These watches are seen as an investment thanks to Chrono24 and similar resale sites. The resale market is also boosting Richemont owner of JaegerLeCoultre and Cartier and 'jeweller and goldsmith by appointment to Prince Charles'. The prince sports a Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso watch (prices range from £3750 to £22700).

This week toasts will be raised to the Queen's health in Krug Moet & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot champagne all belonging to LVMH. This will please those with money in Fundsmith which has a stake in this luxury titan. As one such investor I like this fund's focus on companies with pricing power an essential at present.

There is doubt as to whether Unilever another of Fundsmith's warrant holder investments can raise its prices. But other consumer products warrant holders such as Nestle Procter & Gamble Reckitt Cadbury and Schweppes seem to be having more success.

Cadbury and Schweppes are owned by the US multinational Mondelez one of the major stakes at the Finsbury Growth & Income Trust another Train fund to which he has recently committed more of his own money.

Train contends that 'owning shares in solid companies is a good strategy to see you through to the better days to come'. I think that we can all drink to that.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The FDA announced Saturday people should not eat serve or sell FreshKampo or H-E-B brand organic strawberries if they were purchased between March 5 and April 25th.

“Currently the potentially affected FreshKampo and HEB products are past shelf life. People who purchased FreshKampo and HEB fresh organic strawberries between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022 and then froze those strawberries for later consumption should not eat them” the USDA said.

The products were sold at retailers nationwide including:

Aldi

HEB

Kroger

Safeway

Sprouts Farmers Market

Trader Joe’s

Walmart

Weis Markets

WinCo Foods

If you are unsure of what brand you purchased or when they were bought the FDA recommends throwing themstrawberries away.

A total of 17 cases of hepatitis A including 12 that required hospitalization have been reported with cases in California Minnesota and North Dakota.

Hepatitis A is a contagious disease that can cause liver damage and can be caused by consuming contaminated food or water. Contamination of food and water can occur when an infected handler prepares food without appropriate hand washing hygiene according to the FDA.

Symptoms of hepatitis A infection include fatigue nausea vomiting abdominal pain jaundice dark urine and pale stool. Illness usually occurs within 15 to 50 days after eating or drinking contaminated food or water.

Adam Lee Black was fatally shot Thursday night. Investigators say a Walmart employee and other customers confronted the suspect Anthony Brown who was alleged to have been shoplifting in the electronics section.

Brown opened fire and killed Black and also injured an employee.

According to Black’s family he was a security guard. They say he sprung into action when he saw someone in need. His mother says he died doing what he passionate about.

""It's like the minute you do something right and get on the best path somebody steals it from you"" his mother Shirley Damron said. She says her son had just moved to Hamilton with his fiancee and was expecting a child.

""I was so proud of the man that he become because he worked so hard to get there” she said.

""I want to be assured that this man Anthony Brown will never forget my son” Damron said. “You took my sons life. I hope he will never be allowed to walk the street again.”

Brown was already out on bond for a pending robbery case.

“It's so senseless our criminal system isn't keeping people behind bars” Damron said. “They’re letting them out so they can commit the same offenses again.”

Black's mother wants justice for her son's death. She’s remembering him as a caring and kind person who was the life of the party.

""My son was a hero and I want everyone in the state of Ohio and this country to know my son” Damron said. “I want him to be known for the bravery he provided to help Walmart and anyone that was there in the line of that man trying to get away.”

Damron says her son was her best friend.

Here’s the info from the FDA which was updated on May 28 2022:

Recommended Videos

The FDA along with CDC the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency state and local partners are investigating a multistate outbreak of hepatitis A infections in the United States and Canada potentially linked to fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo and HEB purchased between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022.

Currently the potentially affected FreshKampo and HEB products are past shelf life. People who purchased FreshKampo and HEB fresh organic strawberries between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022 and then froze those strawberries for later consumption should not eat them. These products were sold at the following retailers including but not limited to:

Aldi

HEB

Kroger

Safeway

Sprouts Farmers Market

Trader Joe’s

Walmart

Weis Markets

WinCo Foods

If you are unsure of what brand you purchased when you purchased your strawberries or where you purchased them from prior to freezing them the strawberries should be thrown away.

Epidemiologic and traceback data show that fresh organic strawberries sold as FreshKampo and HEB brands that were purchased between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022 are a likely cause of illness in this outbreak. The traceback investigations show that cases in California Minnesota and Canada report having purchased fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo or HEB prior to becoming ill. Illness onset dates range from March 28 – April 30 2022.

As this investigation is ongoing additional products may be included. More information will be provided in this advisory as it becomes available.

Recommendation

Consumers restaurants and retailers should not sell serve or eat any fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo or HEB if purchased between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022. People who purchased the fresh strawberries and then froze those strawberries for later consumption should not eat them. They should be thrown away. Currently the potentially affected product is past its shelf life. If you are unsure of what brand you purchased when you purchased your strawberries or where you purchased them from prior to freezing them the strawberries should be thrown away.

If consumers purchased fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo or HEB between March 5 2022 and April 25 2022 ate those berries in the last two weeks and have not been vaccinated against hepatitis A they should immediately consult with their healthcare professional to determine whether post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is needed. PEP is recommended for unvaccinated people who have been exposed to hepatitis A virus in the last two weeks because vaccination can prevent a hepatitis A infection if given within 14 days of exposure. Those with evidence of previous hepatitis A vaccination or previous hepatitis A infection do not require PEP.

Contact your healthcare provider if you think you may have symptoms of a hepatitis A infection after eating these fresh organic strawberries or if you believe that you have eaten these strawberries in the last two weeks.

Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)

Hepatitis A is a contagious virus that can cause liver disease. A hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. In rare cases particularly for people with a pre-existing health condition or people with weakened immune systems hepatitis A infections can progress to liver failure and death.

The majority of hepatitis A infections are from unknown causes or from being in close contact with an infected person; however some hepatitis A infections are caused by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Contamination of food and water can occur when an infected food handler prepares food without appropriate hand washing hygiene.

Symptoms

Illness usually occurs within 15 to 50 days after eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Symptoms of hepatitis A infection include fatigue nausea vomiting abdominal pain jaundice dark urine and pale stool. In some instances particularly in children under the age of six hepatitis A infection may be asymptomatic.

People with hepatitis A infections usually completely recover within one to two weeks; however in rare cases hepatitis A may become chronic causing relapsing infection. Chronic hepatitis A infection can lead to more severe health problems including liver failure and death.

Due to the range in severity of illness people should consult their health care provider if they suspect that they have developed symptoms that resemble a(n) hepatitis A infection.

At-Risk Groups

All people are susceptible to hepatitis A infection; however individuals who have had hepatitis A before or who have been vaccinated are immune to hepatitis A infection. Learn more about People at Risk of Foodborne Illness.

Treatment and Prevention of Hepatitis A

Because hepatitis A virus infections can have serious health consequences the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends providing post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated people who have consumed any contaminated food or water within two weeks of exposure.

PEP consists of:

Hepatitis A vaccine for people between the ages of 1 and 40 years

Hepatitis A virus-specific immunoglobulin (IG) for people outside of this age range but the hepatitis A vaccine can be substituted if IG is not available.

Those with evidence of previous vaccination or who can confirm previous hepatitis A illness do not require PEP.

If you are unsure if you have been vaccinated against hepatitis A contact your health professional to check your immunization records. If you have been vaccinated no further action is needed. If you have never received the hepatitis A vaccine getting a single dose within two weeks of exposure can protect against illness. If you are unable to determine whether you have already been vaccinated receiving an additional dose of vaccine is not harmful if you have already been vaccinated.

Who Should Receive the Hepatitis A Vaccine?

In general CDC recommends the following groups be vaccinated for hepatitis A:

All children at age 1 year

Travelers to countries that have high rates of hepatitis A

Family members and caregivers of recent adoptees from countries where hepatitis A is common

Men who have unprotected sexual contact with other men

Users of injection and illegal drugs

People with chronic (lifelong) liver diseases hepatitis B or hepatitis C

People who are treated with clotting-factor concentrates

People who work with hepatitis A infected animals or in a hepatitis A research laboratory

Foods Linked to U.S. Outbreaks of Hepatitis A

Although foodborne illnesses caused by hepatitis A are not common in the U.S. water shellfish raw vegetables and fruit (berries) and salads are most frequently cited as potential foodborne sources.

Preventing Foodborne Illness at Home

Hepatitis A can have serious health consequences. The CDC advises the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) described above for unvaccinated persons who have consumed any products contaminated by the hepatitis A virus.

To prevent hepatitis A contamination or transmission consumers should always practice safe food handling and preparation measures by following the steps below:

Wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw foods.

Thoroughly wash hands after using the bathroom and changing diapers for protection against hepatitis A as well as other foodborne diseases.

Wash the inside walls and shelves of the refrigerator cutting boards and countertops and utensils that may have contacted contaminated foods; then sanitize them with a solution of one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to one gallon of hot water; dry with a clean cloth or paper towel that has not been previously used.

Wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process.

Consumers can also  a complaint or adverse event (illness or serious allergic reaction) related to a food product. submit a voluntarily report  a complaint or adverse event (illness or serious allergic reaction) related to a food product.

Advice for Restaurants and Retailers

Retailers restaurants and other food service operators who have processed and packaged any potentially contaminated products need to be concerned about cross contamination of cutting surfaces and utensils through contact with the potentially contaminated products.

In the event that retailers and/or other food service operators are found to have handled recalled or other potentially contaminated food in their facilities they should:

Wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw foods.

Contact their local health department and communicate to their customers regarding possible exposure to hepatitis A virus and the potential benefit of post-exposure prophylaxis.

Wash the inside walls and shelves of the refrigerator cutting boards and countertops and utensils that may have contacted contaminated foods; then sanitize them with a solution of one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to one gallon of hot water; dry with a clean cloth or paper towel that has not been previously used.

Wash and sanitize display cases where potentially contaminated products were served or stored.

Always wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process.

Conduct regular frequent cleaning and sanitizing of cutting boards and utensils used in processing to help minimize the likelihood of cross-contamination.

""Goofy was never my favorite character Tinkerbell was but he became my favorite after my grandpa died"" she told Insider. ""He was my papa's favorite and he loved interacting with Goofy at the parks. I have really nice photos of them together.""

So when she had the chance to hug the character at Disney World for the first time since the pandemic started Rachul quickly became emotional.

Her mom captured a video of their interaction where Rachul is seen with a surprised reaction before breaking down into tears. She then runs over to Goofy who's standing with open arms and embraces him. The clip has nearly 2 million views as of Saturday.

But after posting the footage Rachul's sweet moment turned sour. Countless commenters harshly criticized her emotional reaction saying she ""should be embarrassed"" and ""get help.""

The Ohio native told Insider she grew up visiting Disney World with her family

They often went multiple times per year with their most recent trip in early May.

""I saw Disney's TikTok teasing that they were going to bring back these interactions which has been something I've missed very very much and I immediately started crying. It was foreshadowing I guess"" she joked.

She started preparing weeks in advance purchasing a Goofy-inspired headband from Etsy and hunting down a hard-to-find vintage Goofy T-shirt.

And on the first day of the trip her family went straight to Epcot and were the first people in the meet-and-greet line.

Rachul said she felt calm at first but quickly turned emotional and started crying when Goofy rounded the corner.

""I was standing there a little frozen because I was like 'Oh my God this poor person just started their shift and this is what they have to deal with at 9 a.m.'"" she said. ""But it felt like a small string that had been connecting me to my papa that was snipped because of COVID had been retied.""

Because she works in public relations Rachul said she knew the video of their interaction had the potential to go viral.

But what she didn't expect was for TikTok's algorithm to push the clip to non-Disney fans many of whom left hateful comments. While Rachul said she wasn't offended by most of them she was alarmed.

""A few of the comments I deleted. They were outright vile"" she said. ""Others were well written but so cruel like 'I urge you to seek therapy for what seems to be a very aggressive mental-health problem.'""

She later addressed the criticism in a second TikTok video and urged others to speak out against cyberbullying.

""It's not about me"" she told Insider. ""It's the fact that there are teenagers who think it's appropriate to suggest a stranger should go to therapy when they don't know that stranger's history with mental health. ""

'Disney adults' often face particularly intense backlash online

Grown Disney fans are often described as ""weird"" and ""immature"" with some of the criticism extending offline as Disney fans previously told Insider.

Rachul said she's experienced those criticisms before. She said there's an assumption that they ""don't have adult interests"" and a misconception that Disney adults all ""live in their parents' basement"" which she says is ironic because she owns a home.

Even those who defend Disney adults in Rachul's experience have misconceptions about the fandom.

""Sometimes they say 'All Disney adults experience severe childhood trauma so this is them trying to reclaim it'"" she said. ""I just want to be very clear: I had a lovely childhood as did many of my friends who are Disney influencers.""

""The reason I think so many people hate Disney adults is seen in my comment section. People who say 'Wow I wish I could be this happy.'"" she said. ""We are so secure in who we are and what we like. It pisses people off because they want to be like that and they can't.""

In Rachul's experience the Disney community itself has been the exact opposite providing nothing but love and support to other fans.

That's one reason why she's eager to speak out against cyberbullying and to also encourage other Disney adults to express themselves freely.

""I was angry seeing people write 'This is why I'm afraid to go to Disney I don't want to be judged'"" she said. ""To those people I'd say make the account follow Disney influencers and fans and fill your feed with people who share the same passion as you and interact with them.""

Despite the backlash she faced Rachul remembers her Goofy hug fondly largely thanks to Disney employees.

""It was the best character hug I've ever gotten. I can cry thinking about it"" she said. ""All I could think about was how my papa was my absolute best friend in the world. I was homeschooled and he lived with us so there was never a moment we weren't together. Goofy could tell I needed some kind of comfort at that moment.""

""I know the Disney cast members also got a lot of hateful comments from my video — like people implying they hate their jobs — but I just want to thank the ones who were involved"" she said. ""They never made me feel like I didn't deserve a magical character interaction because I'm an adult.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtZmVhdHVyZXMvcGl4YXItdHVybmluZy1yZWQtYnJhY2VmYWNlLWRpc25leS0xOTQ2LXBlcmlvZHMtc2hvcnQtbW92aWUtMTIzNTE1MTkyOC_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy9waXhhci10dXJuaW5nLXJlZC1icmFjZWZhY2UtZGlzbmV5LTE5NDYtcGVyaW9kcy1zaG9ydC1tb3ZpZS0xMjM1MTUxOTI4L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Before Pixar’s ‘Turning Red’ ‘Braceface’ and a 1946 Disney Short Tackled the “Taboo” of Menstruation,"When Pixar‘s Turning Red debuted on Disney+ in March much of the anticipated response to the Y2K coming-of-age tale about Mei a Chinese-Canadian teen who transforms into a red panda as she begins going through puberty was celebration.

But in the weeks that followed the movie’s release the conversation around it steered sharply from championing a step forward in inclusive storytelling — the film marked the studio’s first to be solely directed by a Chinese-Canadian woman and featured its first lead Asian character — and devolved into a heated debate. The controversy would ultimately revolve around whether an animated movie targeted at children should be allowed even metaphorically to allude to menstruation.

In an interview with Polygon director and co-writer Domee Shi explained that the Red Panda metaphor spoke not only to puberty but also to “what we inherit from our moms and how we deal with the things that we inherit from them.”

“Everybody on the crew was unapologetic in support of having these real conversations about periods and about these moments in girls’ lives” producer Lindsey Collins said.

That decision didn’t sit well with some parents who descended on review hubs like Common Sense Media (which focuses on media suitability for children) to charge that the Pixar film had crossed a line for younger viewers with its “multiple mentions of periods and pads” as one reviewer noted.

“This was extremely disappointing! We’re all set to watch it with friends on a snow day and it’s completely inappropriate for any kids under 13” another adult reviewer who had marked the film as having “too much sex” wrote. “Puberty boy crazy lying to parents sneaking out and more unhealthy ways of dealing with emotions.”

(Puberty can begin as early as eight according to the Cleveland Clinic with menstruation starting around 12 though it can occur earlier.)

For Braceface creator Melissa Clarke the backlash sounded all too familiar. Her animated series which ran on the Disney-owned network ABC Family for three seasons tackled menstruation in 2001 during the show’s first season in “The Worst First Date Ever: Period.”

“I got a lot of letters from pissed-off moms” the writer and series creator recalled. “One of them said ‘My 13-year-old daughter and I thought we were sitting down to watch a fun cartoon and then I had to explain to her what a period was.’ We were like ‘Oh so that’s a thank you letter is what you’re saying.'”

Written by showrunner Alyse Rosenberg and “welcomed” by studio Nelvana the story saw its leading character “braceface” Sharon on her first date with a crush when she gets her first period. Ultimately the episode attempts to provide a look at how tweens can respond — with everything from anxiety to pride — to puberty-related experiences.

“It sort of captured the taboo subjects which is to say is life” Clarke said of her series overall. “I really wanted Braceface to be the TV version of a Judy Blume book to be a landing space for the kind of kid that I was that needed the storytelling.”

Lauren Rosewarne author of Periods in Pop Culture: Menstruation in Film and Television says negative reaction to these storylines has been an ongoing issue fueled by the perception of menstruation as an “adult” subject.

“There is a tendency for some people — generally conservative people often with strong religious convictions — to think that all sex education should be provided in the home rather than via third parties like schools or media” Rosewarne told THR. “Menstruation gets bundled together with other perceived ‘adult’ topics — like intercourse or masturbation — considered sensitive private and often uncomfortable or embarrassing to discuss.”

One result of that position has been historically negative representations of periods associating them with “embarrassment bad moods and occasionally even crime” she said. Additionally both live-action and animated film and TV have depicted the existence of menstruation as something to be used strategically — a convenient excuse for getting out of gym class or overindulging in food.

But not all shows have taken these kinds of approaches including the sitcom Roseanne which treated Darlene’s first period as “something positive” that enabled her to be a parent Rosewarne told THR. The representational treatment of periods in TV and film can also depend on the genre with comedies leaning into allusions while teen-oriented media is more likely to have a focus on education anticipation and even activism.

“I think animation aimed at younger audiences would be more likely to avoid including it unless it was consciously aiming to function as sex education” Rosewarne said.

That was the case for a 1946 Disney short The Story of Menstruation which was produced in partnership with the International Cellucotton Products Company the marketing arm of Kimberly-Clark maker of Kotex products. One of the first branded films used in schools and eventually shown to 100 million students the Walt Disney Company oversaw the first script drafts and the conceptualization of visual material with the producers bringing in a gynecologist consultant to ensure scientific accuracy.

The emphasis “on biological themes” in the script which was guided by K-C helped make its tone objective and unemotional according to Kotex Kleenex Huggies: Kimberly-Clark and the Consumer Revolution in American Business. Along with the short the ICPC released a supplemental teaching guide which suggested educators address menstruation informally in fourth grade before a more “systematic” focus in seventh.

This more sanitized approach shaped in part by a screen test that resulted in major edits was by design Bob Batchelor Kotex Kleenex Huggies co-author told THR. “There were many cultural factors that K-C and Disney had to consider when making The Story of Menstruation like how to show sexual organs and depict blood” he explained. “They had to be tactful and sensitive particularly if they wanted to gain wide approval. Then as now much of the nation was overtly conservative in its views of sexuality and sex education so the film had to sidestep potential barriers.”

Rosewarne notes that the U.S. TV and film industry historically operated under production codes that made it difficult to present menstruation. The dominance of men in media production as well as network and classification concerns were also influences on period representation. “Generally producers want their material seen by as many people as possible therefore they will often avoid including content that will limit who can see it” she said.

Released decades apart The Story of Menstruation Turning Red and Braceface were ultimately grappling with the same threat of backlash. But unlike its more modern counterparts the short and its supplemental materials’ broaching of menstruation were accepted as age-appropriate for those under 13. It was lauded during its initial release by teachers administrators and parents “yearning for high quality educational resources” Batchelor said. One student even described it as something that could be enjoyed “instead of feeling hush-hush.”

“Schools had a more direct role in preparing youngsters for life rather than a focus on going to college so health and sex ed were extremely important” said Batchelor of sex education being more central in the education system then compared to present-day.

Despite this mixed reception around menstruation animation Rosewarne says the stigma around periods onscreen has “absolutely lessened over time” thanks to the Internet social media cable TV and now streaming services. “They are simply not beholden to the taste or classification concerns that have plagued cinema and broadcast television” she concluded.

For Clarke the shift is important as a creative who wants to help those who are seeking answers.

“Looking back as a kid I was just so full of shame and everything felt icky and weird. I guess because my parents weren’t comfortable with any of it. So I really picked up shame from it and I feel like there was absolutely no need for that” Clarke said. “Why is it so loaded for some people when it’s just part of being alive?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd2R3bnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvbmV3LTUwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktbXVzaWMtYm94LWF2YWlsYWJsZS1hdC13YWx0LWRpc25leS13b3JsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New 50th Anniversary Music Box Available at Walt Disney World,"A new 50th anniversary music box featuring Cinderella Castle Mickey and his friends is now available at Walt Disney World.

The media and entertainment industry prides itself on its mastery of classical storytelling's three acts: the setup the conflict and the resolution. It's safe to declare the first act of the streaming video wars over. Barring a surprise late entrant every major media and technology company that wants to be in the streaming game has planted a flag. Disney+ Apple TV+ Paramount+ Peacock and other new streaming services are spreading around the globe. ""Act one was the land grab phase"" said Chris Marangi a media investor and portfolio manager at Gamco Investors. ""Now we're in the middle act."" Last month the central conflict of the streaming wars came into focus. The industry was thrust into turmoil after Netflix disclosed its first quarterly drop in subscribers in more than a decade and warned subscriber losses would continue in the near term.

Second act problems Netflix's rapid decline after a pandemic-fueled boom has investors questioning the value of investing in media companies.

Streaming is the future of the business regardless of recent problems as consumers have gotten used to the flexibility the services offer.

There could be more consolidation to come and streamers are increasingly embracing cheaper ad-supported tiers.

That news set off worries about streaming's future and cast doubt on whether the growing number of platforms could become profitable. At stake are the valuations of the world's largest media and entertainment companies — Disney  Comcast  Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery — and the tens of billions of dollars being spent each year on new original streaming content. As recently as October Netflix whose hit series ""Stranger Things"" returned Friday had a market capitalization more than $300 billion topping Disney's at $290 billion. But its shares are down over 67% from the start of the year slashing the company's worth to around $86 billion. Legacy media companies that followed Netflix's lead and pivoted to streaming video have suffered too. Disney shares are among the worst performing stocks on the Dow Jones industrials this year down about 30%. That's even though series such as ""The Book of Boba Fett"" and ""Moon Knight"" helped Disney+ add 20 million subscribers in the past two quarters. The highly anticipated ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" premiered on Friday. Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO and HBO Max services also added 12.8 million subscribers over the past year bringing total subscribers to 76.8 million globally. But shares are down more than 20% since the company's stock began trading in April following the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery. Nobody knows whether streaming's final act will reveal a path to profitability or which players might emerge dominant. Not that long ago the formula for streaming success seemed straightforward: Add subscribers see stock prices climb. But Netflix's shocking freefall has forced executives to rethink their next moves. ""The pandemic created a boom with all these new subscribers efficiently stuck at home and now a bust"" said Michael Nathanson a MoffettNathanson media analyst. ""Now all these companies need to make a decision. Do you keep chasing Netflix around the globe or do you stop the fight?""

Stick with streaming

Traditional TV also lacks the flexibility of streaming which many viewers have come to prefer. Digital viewing allows for mobile watching on multiple devices at any time. A la carte pricing gives consumers more choices compared with having to spend nearly $100 a month on a bundle of cable networks most of which they don't watch.

More deals

Consolidation is another prospect given the growing number of players vying for viewers. As it stands Amazon Prime Video Apple TV+ Disney+ HBO Max/Discovery+ Netflix Paramount+ and Peacock all have global ambitions as profitable streaming services. Media executives largely agree that some of those services will need to combine quibbling only about how many will survive. One major acquisition could alter how investors view the industry's potential said Gamco's Marangi. ""Hopefully the final act is growth again"" he said. ""The reason to stay invested is you don't know when act three will begin."" U.S. regulators may make any deal among the largest streamers difficult. Amazon bought MGM the studio behind the James Bond franchise for $8.5 billion but it's unclear whether it would want to buy anything much larger. Government restrictions around broadcast station ownership would almost certainly doom a deal that put say NBC and CBS together. That likely eliminates a straight merger between parent companies NBCUniversal and Paramount Global without divesting one of the two broadcast networks and its owned affiliates in a separate messier transaction. But if streaming continues to take over as the dominant form of viewership it's possible regulators will eventually soften to the idea that broadcast network ownership is anachronistic. New presidential administrations may be open to deals current regulators may try to deny.

Advertising hopes

Evan Spiegel CEO of SNAP Inc. Stephen Desaulniers | CNBC

""Advertising is an inherently volatile business"" said Patrick Steel former CEO of Politico the political digital media company. ""The slowdown which started in the fall has accelerated in the last few months. We are now in a down cycle."" Offering cheaper ad-supported subscription won't matter unless Netflix and Disney give consumers a reason to sign up with consistently good shows said Bill Smead chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management whose funds own shares of Warner Bros. Discovery. The shift in the second act of the streaming wars could see investors rewarding the best content rather than the most powerful model of distribution. Netflix co-founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings told the New York Times his company ""is continuing to have some of the most popular shows in America and around the world."" But it remains to be seen if Netflix can compete with legacy media's established content engines and intellectual property when the market isn't rewarding ever-ballooning budgets. ""Netflix broke the moat of traditional pay TV which was a very good profitable business and investors followed"" said Smead. ""But Netflix may have underestimated how hard it is to consistently come up with great content especially when capital markets stop supporting you and the Fed stops giving away free money.""

Try something else

The major problem with staying the course is it's not an exciting new opportunity for investors who have soured on the streaming wars. ""The days of getting a tech multiple on these companies are probably over"" said Andrew Walker a portfolio manager at Rangeley Capital whose fund also owns Warner Bros. Discovery. ""But maybe you don't need a tech multiple to do well at these prices? That's what we're all trying to figure out right now."" Offering a new storyline is one way to change the stale investment narrative. Media analyst Rich Greenfield advocates Disney acquire Roblox a gaming company based on digital multiplayer interactive worlds to show investors it's leaning into creating experiential entertainment. ""I just keep thinking about Bob Iger"" Greenfield said of the former Disney CEO who departed the company in December. ""When he came in he made his mark by buying Pixar. That transformative transaction was doing something big and bold early on.""

Given the extreme pullback on Roblox shares Greenfield noted Disney CEO Bob Chapek has an opportunity to make a transformative deal that could alter the way investors view his company. Roblox's enterprise value is about $18 billion down from about $60 billion at the start of the year. But media companies have historically shied away from gaming and other out-of-the-box acquisitions. Under Iger Disney shut down its game development division in 2016. Acquisitions can help companies diversify and help them plant a flag in another industry but they can also lead to mismanagement culture clash and poor decision making (see: AOL-Time Warner AT&T-DirecTV AT&T-Time Warner). Comcast recently rejected a deal to merge NBCUniversal with video game company EA according to a person familiar with the matter. Puck was first to report the discussions. Yet big media companies are no longer compelling products on their own said Eric Jackson founder and president of EMJ Capital who focuses on media and technology investing. Apple and Amazon have developed streaming services to bolster their services offerings around their primary businesses. Apple TV+ is compelling as an added reason for consumers to buy Apple phones and tablets Jackson said but it's not special as an individual stand-alone service. Amazon Prime Video amounts to a benefit making a Prime subscription more compelling though the primary reason to subscribe to Prime continues to be free shipping for Amazon's enormous e-commerce business. There's no obvious reason the business will suddenly be valued differently Jackson said. The era of the stand-alone pure-play media company may be over he said. ""Media/streaming is now the parsley on the meal — not the meal"" he said. Disclosure: CNBC is part of NBCUniversal which is owned by Comcast.

Sony Video Games Horizon Zero Dawn God of War and Gran Turismo Are Getting Series Treatment

In Thursday’s investor briefing call Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra announced the plans to adapt PlayStation titles Horizon Zero Dawn and Gran Turismo to television.

Horizon Zero Dawn which is in early development at Netflix is based on the popular action role-playing game that follows a young huntress named Aloy who braves a post-apocalyptic wilderness overrun by giant robot dinosaurs as she searches for answers about her past. Gran Turismo based on Sony’s successful racing video game franchise is in early development but has yet to find a distributor.

In addition Sony confirmed that its God of War series which was first announced back in March has been acquired by Amazon’s Prime Video streaming platform.

Considering the recent trend of video game adaptations hitting the small screen with Starz’s Halo series being the most recent of these types of projects to air it’s looking like video games are finally hitting their stride on TV. And the aforementioned titles are just the latest that Sony and Playstation Productions are adapting. Their post-apocalyptic zombie thriller Last Of Us starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey is in the works at HBO; Twisted Metal based on the car combat video games and starring Anthony Mackie Stephanie Beatriz Neve Campbell and Thomas Haden Church is heading to Peacock; and the immersive samurai tale Ghost of Tsushima is getting the feature film treatment from John Wick director Chad Stahelski.

Casting: Pete Davidson Kate McKinnon Aidy Bryant and Kyle Mooney Exit Saturday Night Live

NBC’s long-running sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live has undergone a major cast shakeup as stars Pete Davidson Kate McKinnon Aidy Bryant and Kyle Mooney have left the show. Season 47 has featured the largest cast the program has ever had with 21 stars in total. Last year Beck Bennett and Lauren Holt were the only names to say goodbye to the Lorne Michaels–run production.

Davidson who regularly makes celebrity news headlines most recently due to his high-profile relationship with Kim Kardashian began his run on SNL in 2014 and his acting career has gained traction in recent years. He co-wrote and starred in The King of Staten Island and is co-creating and starring opposite Edie Falco in the Peacock series Bupkis which was just ordered straight-to-series by the streamer.

McKinnon joined the program in 2012 and quickly rose the ranks as one of the show’s standout players winning two Emmys for her comedy work during her decade-long run on the series. McKinnon starred alongside SNL alumni Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones in Paul Feig’s Ghostbusters movie and has recently been seen in Peacock’s Tiger King scripted series Joe vs. Carole in which she played Carole Baskin.

Bryant also joined the show in 2012 and became a fan favorite performing hilarious impersonations of political figures like Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Ted Cruz. And like McKinnon and Davidson Bryant has focused on other projects aside from SNL over the past few years including her starring role in Hulu’s comedy series Shrill.

Last but not least is Kyle Mooney who has been with the show since 2013. In December Mooney’s adult animation series Saturday Morning All-Star Hits! premiered on Netflix showcasing the SNL performer’s signature humor. (Hollywood Reporter)

Another issue with the series is reportedly the program’s projected budget which is set to be more than $200 million higher than that for HBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series House of the Dragon.

Warner Bros. Discovery will make a decision soon regarding the future of the sci-fi drama which cast Danielle Deadwyler (Station Eleven Watchmen) in April THR reported. While the buzzy series is in jeopardy at the network Bad Robot’s overall deal with Warner Bros. Discovery remains intact. Aside from Demimonde Abrams is developing an adult animated Batman series with Felicity collaborator Matt Reeves (director of The Batman) and he’s got multiple scripted projects based on his own original ideas in the works including HBO Max’s mind-bending thriller Subject to Change.

A U2 scripted series the studio is producing for Netflix Apple’s Presumed Innocent HBO Max’s crime drama Duster and HBO Max’s DC Comics–based Justice League Dark franchise are also on Bad Robots’ development slate.

With ‘Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore’ disappointing at the box office the future of the ‘Harry Potter’ universe is currently up in the air. If Warner Bros. Discovery wishes to reinvigorate the Wizarding World franchise with a ‘Harry Potter’ and the Cursed Child adaptation then Daniel Radcliffe's reluctance to return needn't necessarily be a sticking point as ‘Fantastic Beasts 3’ has proven.

Gellert Grindelwald has been portrayed by multiple actors throughout the Harry Potter/Wizarding World movies with Johnny Depp playing the criminal wizard in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.

In early May Warner Bros. Discovery and BT announced that two staples of sports TV in the UK – BT Sport and Eurosport – will be merging into a single premium TV and streaming sports service.

While the news wasn’t surprising (as BT Sport has been looking for a partner for a while) many questions were left unanswered by the initial announcement:

Is Eurosport going away? What will BT Sport customers get from this? Is this going to cost more – or less – than what sports fans are paying now? And the biggest question of all – when is this even happening?

With so many questions coming in from readers we decided to create this Q&A guide that includes all the information we were able to gather and confirm so far.

Keep in mind however that at this stage some of the details can still change since the deal is waiting for regulatory approval – which is why there are still many unknowns.

But here’s everything we know so far about the upcoming BT Sport / Discovery merger.

The Players: BT Sport Eurosport And Discovery+

BT Sport which has been around in its current form since 2013 broadcasts sporting events from the UK and worldwide.

For years BT Sport was only available as an add-on to traditional pay-TV subscriptions like Sky or BT’s own BT TV and broadband customers.

In 2019 a monthly contract-free streaming version of BT Sport was finally introduced at a monthly rate of £25 (See our complete guide on how to watch BT Sport online – even for free).

Eurosport is a French sports TV network owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. It operates in more than 50 countries and holds the rights to many sporting events around the world.

Eurosport is available as premium channels in the UK on the pay-TV platforms yet it also used to have a standalone streaming service Eurosport Player.

But as we reported last year Eurosport Player is being phased out in favour of Discovery+ with the sports broadcasts becoming a part of the Discovery+ Sports plan on the Discovery+ service and app.

Discovery+ is a streaming service that launched in 2020 when it replaced Discovery’s Dplay service (which was totally free) with a combined offering of both free and premium channels.

The free tier on Discovery+ includes several Freeview channels such as Quest Really HGTV and others while the paid tiers add additional live premium channels along with their on-demand content – Discovery Channel Animal Planet TLC and more.

The paid tier has TWO separate plans: Entertainment (£3.99/month with adverts) and Entertainment + Sports (£6.99/month) – which currently also includes the content that used to reside on Eurosport Player.

BT Sport And Eurosport: What’s Changing?

On May 12 2022 BT and Discovery announced a new joint venture that will bring together BT Sport and Eurosport.

A 50:50 company will be formed for the joint venture with BT Sport transferring its operations to Warner Bros. Discovery.

By bringing together the sports content of the two leading services the new platform will have one of the most extensive portfolios of premium sports rights including UEFA Champions League the Premier League the Olympic Games Premiership Rugby and more.

When Will Customers See These Changes?

When the deal was first announced many were under the impression these changes were imminent with BT Sport and Eurosport already coming together.

But that’s not the case: BT and Warner Bros. Discovery already confirmed that the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including approvals by the relevant regulators.

The deal is therefore expected to complete by the end of 2022.

Until then nothing will change for customers: BT Sport and Eurosport / Discovery+ are still for now two completely separate platforms.

Are BT Sport / Eurosport Going Away?

The short answer is: not yet.

Once the joint venture deal is completed there will be two separate stages:

1. At first BT Sport and Eurosport will continue to retain their separate brands and product propositions.

So while customers may get combined deals and offers at that point BT Sport and Eurosport UK will continue to exist as two separate TV and streaming platforms (but with new owners behind the scenes).

2. In the future the plan is to bring the two platforms together under a single brand (with either an entirely new name or one that uses/combines the old names in some way).

If and when that happens BT Sport and Eurosport UK will no longer exist as separate brands and customers will get the combined sports broadcasts as part of a single service.

What Can I Watch On BT Sport And Eurosport?

Once the two platforms come together they will hold the rights to some of the most significant sporting events including (as of this writing):

UEFA Champions League

UEFA Europa League

Premier League

Premiership Rugby

UFC

The Olympic Games

Tennis Grand Slams featuring the Australian Open and Roland-Garros

Cycling Grand Tours including the Tour de France and Giro d’Italia

Winter sports World Cup season

Will I Get Eurosport / Discovery+ For Free?

While pricing details for the planned combined service haven’t been announced yet there are benefits for BT TV and BT Sports customers that have been confirmed and will become available once the final deal comes through.

BT Sport subscribers who get their subscription directly from BT as well as most BT TV customers will get the discovery+ streaming service (along with Eurosport) as part of their subscriptions at no extra cost.

This means that customers who subscribe to BT Sport via other 3rd party platforms – such as Virgin Media and Sky – will not be part of this deal and will not get Discovery+ and Eurosport for free (at least as of this writing).

It’s worth noting however that Sky has a separate deal with Discovery – and currently Sky Q customers (but not Sky Glass) get one free year of Discovery+. But it’s only the Entertainment tier without Eurosport’s content.

At this point it’s unclear whether BT Sport Monthly Pass subscribers the standalone £25/month streaming service will also get Discovery+ for free.

Will Discovery+ / Eurosport Customers Get BT Sport For Free?

Unfortunately no.

In the early stages at least (even once the deal closes) there will be no changes for discovery+ subscribers and if they want BT Sport they will have to sign up for it separately.

This is understandable in terms of pricing – the BT Sport monthly pass currently costs £25/month on its own so it doesn’t make sense it will get added at no extra cost to Discovery Plus’ £6.99/month subscription.

Will The BT Sport / Eurosport Merger Save Me Money?

In the early stages of the new joint venture it seems only eligible BT Sport subscribers will save money (£6.99/m) – by getting Discovery+ and its Eurosport content for free.

Going forward especially once the two brands are joined together into a single platform we hope the combined cost will be less than the current separate costs of BT Sport and Discovery+/Eurosport – but it’s too early to tell.

How Can I Watch Discovery+ Eurosport And BT Sport?

Discovery+ is a streaming-only app; therefore it relies on your broadband connection.

It’s available on most of the streaming devices sold in the UK including:

Amazon Fire TV

Roku

Google Chromecast

Android / iPhone

Apple TV

Samsung Smart TVs

Sky Q (Subscribers can get a free one-year Discovery+ membership)

Sky Glass

Major web browsers

Discovery+ offers two tiers – Entertainment (£3.99/month with adverts) and Entertainment + Sports (£6.99/month) which is the one that includes Eurosport.

You can also sign up to Discovery+ via Amazon as a Prime Video channel for the same £6.99/month. That way you’ll be able to watch Discovery+ (and Eurosport) on any device that has the Prime Video app.

To get BT Sport you need to either sign up via one of the pay-TV platforms:

Or you can subscribe to the standalone BT Sport Monthly Pass streaming service.

Platform: Zoom

Language: English

India’s northeast is getting swamped by a mammoth mountain of solid waste. The region generates more than 3100 metric tonne of waste every day of which nearly 85 per cent is dumped on land or in waterbodies without processing and treatment. Every city in the region is struggling to manage the solid waste it is generating.

What must the region its municipalities and its people do to salvage the situation? Are landfills the answer? How can the plastic waste be managed? What are the actions that are already being taken and what have been their impacts?

We invite journalists from the northeast to join our Second Northeast Narratives online media briefing workshop to discuss and understand the issue.

Solid waste management experts from Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) who have been studying and analysing the issue in select cities of the northeast will give overviews on the magnitude of the problem the challenges the region faces and the possible solutions.

Representatives from some key municipal authorities from the region are also being invited to speak at the workshop: they would be expected to throw light on efforts and actions being undertaken by the governments.

The workshop will also host a session by editors and data sourcing and environmental resources experts from CSE and Down To Earth who would offer inputs and tips on gathering information and writing on the subject.

Please note: This workshop is open only to practising journalists working in and based in northeast. It is a free workshop but since seats are limited we advise those who are interested to register early

Most efforts to protect our dwindling clean water reserves have been blocked by political self-interest and the results are potentially disastrous not only for America’s large cities but for farmlands and recreation areas as well. These and other disturbing truths are recorded here by Donald E. Carr a veteran research chemist whose book DEATH OF THE SWEET WATERS will be published later this month by Norton.

by Donald E. Carr

THE United States is the biggest water hog in the world. Poor tropical countries use less than 5 gallons of water per person per day. Large commercial towns in England use about 50 gallons a day while the daily average for such towns in the United States is close to 200 gallons per person. The highest water consumption of any city in the world is that of Beverly Hills California — over 500 gallons per person per day where in an arid climate immense lawns are sprinkled the year around and countless swimming pools are filled and refilled.

Modern manufacturing processes also use enormous quantities of water. It takes 18 barrels of water to refine a barrel of oil 300 gallons to make a barrel of beer 600 to 1000 tons of water for each ton of coal burned in a steam-power plant and 250 tons of water to produce a ton of paper. A large paper mill will use more water than a city of 50000 people.

Industries are located near water for three cogent reasons: manufacturing plants use lots of water they must have a place to dispose of the dirty water which is not consumed in the manufacturing process (a very large percentage) and they can often save money by delivering their products by barge rather than by truck or railroad. Industrially polluted water is rarely fit to drink; it is dangerous to swim in lethal for fish and often spoiled for manufacturing processes of other plants downstream. The water of a big industrial river such as the Ohio may be reused a dozen times before it reaches its rendezvous with the Mississippi. Twenty-six rivers in the United States are so badly polluted that the federal government has intervened. Dozens of others are dangerously polluted but the federal agencies have not had time or opportunity to start any action in regard to them. By law the Public Health Service can act on its own in pollution emergencies involving two or more states but within a single state it must await the invitation of the governor.

In general private industrialists are united to a man against federal regulation of water pollution. They prefer state control if any. As it is now each state has its own set of standards for water cleanliness most of them very tolerant. The fact that states along the same river basin may have quite widely varying standards makes it difficult for the Department of Health Education and Welfare to handle interstate pollution. This is the chief justification for the Water Pollution Bill of 1965 which called for setting up federal standards and guidelines. The reason for the clamor against this bill on the part of private water-using industries is easy to perceive. For many years the differences between states in standards of water cleanliness have given industrialists a powerful club which they have not hesitated to use. They can threaten to move a plant downriver where the requirements aren’t so tough. Or they can threaten to move from a Northern state grown more particular to some Southern state with a more relaxed altitude.

Copyright©1966 by Donald E. Carr.

Cries of anguish greeted the requirement in the 1965 pollution bill that waste water from riverside plants should be rendered as “clean as possible.” It was contended that the phrase should be “as clean as economically possible.”

Many industrialists base their argument on a book by Richard B. Engdahl and Frank C. Croxton Pollution: A Problem in Economics in which the key statement is this: “To completely solve the problems involved though it were technically feasible at this time would probably so increase the cost of industrial operations as to endanger our ability to compete in world markets.”

Let us examine this piece of bald-headed sophistry. Our rivers have to be filthy so that we can compete with whom? The West Germans for example? The Ruhr river basin contains nearly half of West Germany’s industrial capacity and has only a skinny streamflow much punier than the lowest flow ever recorded in the Potomac. With such a small amount of water one would expect the highly competitive West Germans to have on their hands a smelly septic barely liquid ditch. In fact the Ruhr River is clean enough to swim in and to grow fish in and with only mild treatment it provides perfectly good drinking water.

The antipollution program that accomplished what to American eyes would appear to be an “uneconomical” miracle was carried out by the Ruhr Associations — Genossenschaften semigovernmental organizations. Instead of establishing treatment requirements or purification standards and trying to enforce them the Ruhr Associations simply charge every town and every industrial plant a stiff levy proportional to the amount of pollution they deliver to the river. As a result the Ruhr Basin has been cleaned up. The water is used and reused but it is also treated and retreated. In some cases as at Essen the solid waste is dried included with the city’s normal garbage and used as fuel for a power plant.

To claim that American plants cannot do as well or would go broke trying is a deception. Nevertheless our industries have had their way so long with most of the state and local authorities that they are not likely to give up. When there is a conflict involving recreational agricultural or aesthetic use of water with industrial application industry almost always wins out. To be sure the more thoughtful industrialists are changing their viewpoints and a good deal of research on water disposal has been paid for with private funds and has been translated into full-scale treating facilities. But many of the offending plants are located in municipalities where domestic sewage winds up raw in the watercourse and thus the companies have a reasonable “Why pick on us?” argument.

Industry spokesmen point out that sewage plants at Gary Indiana and Fort Chicago Illinois for example have horribly polluted Lake Michigan for years and it is not fair to make industries in the area put in expensive pollution-control equipment. They claim that even if all further pollution were prevented it would take more than 25 years for Lake Erie to return to a theoretically clean state and 500 years for Lake Michigan to return to its preindustrial purity.

POLLUTION FROM FOOD PROCESSING

Food-processing industries especially the small operators are quite likely to take the line that if they are located in a community that doesn’t take care of its domestic sewage including the unmentionable waste from mortuaries why should anyone worry about the offal from meat-packing and dressing chickens? The Hudson River at Troy New York for example is a slimy cesspool where eels writhe and fight over chicken entrails. In Sioux City Iowa the U.S. Public Health Service held public hearings in 1958 to outargue the knownothing and do-nothing meat-packers who had been dumping stinking offal into the Missouri River thus contaminating the river waters of four states. Sugar-beet-processing wastes which smell worse than one would expect polluted the whole of the North Platte when delivered to the river in Wyoming.

Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin recalls that in his hometown on a lovely little lake the local creamery had always dumped all of its whey into the lake rendering the water useless for anything else. Everybody in the village knew about it. But the creamery was the town’s biggest employer and the local citizens never let out a peep. Finally the state water pollution commission ordered the creamery to stop.

The canning industry is a large water user especially now that the farmers who sell their vegetables or fruit to the canneries make great use of pesticides. Today it takes 50 gallons of water to wash a case of canned fruit or vegetables whereas it took half that much 20 years ago. The pesticide flows into the river.

PULP AND PAPER WASTES

No industry has had more trouble and aroused more violent public reactions because of river pollution than the pulp and paper companies. There are about 3000 such firms in the United States employing more than 600000 people. American production of paper and paperboard has more than doubled in the last two decades and is now about 40 million tons a year. The industry spokesmen make a big point of the fact that over this period a 50 percent reduction in pollution per ton of paper produced has been achieved. However this is no great consolation to other water users since they are concerned not with percentages but with amounts of gunk in the river — gunk per gallon.

What is the gunk? The worst polluter is socalled “sulfite liquor.” This is the runoff liquor containing the nonfibrous material removed from the wood chips during the cooking process. It is not toxic in the sense that it would poison an animal or infect a human being. It can be broken down by bacterial attack in the water but this requires a large amount of oxygen. Thus the worst effect of paper-and-pulp-mill wastes is that the BOD (biological oxygen demand) soars so high that fish and other water creatures are quickly suffocated. Pollution of this kind is naturally most common in those river basins where the forest cover is of the type from which paper can be made. The Northern coniferous trees are best suited to the sulfite process; hence plants using this manufacturing method are mainly in the North. The Columbia River has chronic sulfite-liquor pollution. In the last 15 years however the Kraft paper process which can handle Southern pine has resulted in the proliferation of paper mills along the Chattahoochee the Savannah and other Southern rivers.

Senator Muskie claims that the Androscoggin River in Maine is the worst-polluted stream in the country. Years ago a dam was built which trapped behind it the effluent from numerous pulp and paper mills. Even if there is no further pollution he maintains this trapped pollutant will make fish life impossible for many years perhaps forever.

Wastes from Kraft mills are alkaline rather than acid but their drain of oxygen supply is just as great. One giant mill on the Coosa River which runs through Georgia and Alabama pours into the stream wastes which absorb as much oxygen as does untreated sewage from a city of 200000 persons. These wastes although not toxic or dangerous in the way that sewage and certain byproducts of the chemical industry are have essentially the same end effect since they rob the water of oxygen needed to assimilate the more perilous gunk. Silt breaks the “chain of food” in a river or lake because it makes the water opaque to sunshine thus killing microscopic plant life. Papermill waste liquors break the chain at several links since all of the assimilation processes in fresh water except putrefaction require oxygen.

TEXTILES AND STEEL

The concentration of textile plants in the South over the past few decades has put a new load on Southern rivers. One textile mill in Georgia pours into the Chattooga River wastes equivalent in BOD to the sewage of 112000 people. The processes of bleaching cotton flax hemp and jute produce a filthy waste containing fatty and oily residue washed from the raw fabric. Wool washings make a highly polluting waste consisting of an emulsion of dirt and bacteria in water with soap and complex proteins as emulsifying agents.

Steel companies have been very effective in destroying rivers and among all industries have tended to be the least cooperative — in fact the most belligerently uncooperative. Pollution of the Mahoning River in Ohio and Pennsylvania by acid lime oil and grease discharged from steel plants has made this river unusable as a source of municipal water hindered its use by other industries and destroyed its value for recreation. The arrogant refusal of three Youngstown steel companies to give effluent data to the Public Health Service has triggered a demand for inclusion of a subpoena clause in the new federal pollution bill.

Three steel companies — the U.S. Steel in Gary Indiana Inland Steel in Chicago and Youngstown Sheet and Tube — are considered to be the chief sources of pollution in the Calumet River and the adjacent waters of Lake Michigan. The Acme Steel Company discharges raw sewage and unneutralized steel-pickling liquor (strong acid) into the Little Calumet River. The filth from the Calumet system of steel companies has affected the whole Chicago area. The currents of Lake Michigan are so sluggish that the wastes do not disperse or float away. They just sit there in the water near the shore and fester. Chicagoans don’t seem to care.

Petroleum oil and fuel have added to Lake Michigan’s mixture of assorted crud. Although the production end of the petroleum business has in the main stopped percolating oil-well brine into freshwater wells and streams some of the giant refineries located near water have not been so scrupulous. Raritan Bay in New Jersey is guaranteed to smear any small boat with oil in a few days. Even when expensive attempts are made to clean up refinery wastes some of the extremely smelly chemicals such as mercaptans and thiophenols give any potable water which they contact a lingering skunky odor. Oil chemicals are also responsible for unpleasant flavor in fish.

Heat has become the latest industrial pollution worry. The temperature of the Mahoning River in Ohio at one time reached 140 degrees Fahrenheit and higher as it picked up steel-mill effluents near Youngstown. This forced local industries to slow down operations or actually to shut down entirely during periods of low flow.

Excessive heat does a lot of things to a river some of which we do not yet understand. It kills fish. It accelerates chemical reactions causing some wastes to be toxic which would have been harmless in cool water. It strips oxygen from the water and hence reduces the ability of scavenging bacteria to do their job. On the other hand a modest amount of heating seems to make for good fishing. On Lake Erie and the Potomac and Delaware rivers at least in stretches where other pollutants are not too thick fishing is best where power companies return their once-through cooling water. The warmer water apparently stimulates the growth of fish food.

The tightest state regulations are those that Pennsylvania set up in 1960. Stream temperature may not be raised above 93 degrees Fahrenheit at any time. No new discharges may be made into a stream suitable for trout propagation if they will drive stream temperature above 58 degrees Fahrenheit. These regulations have been under steady attack. They are claimed to be unrealistic both from the standpoint of economics (costly for electric power companies) and because many warm-water organisms thrive at temperatures higher than 93 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat problem is serious for atomic energy installations on the Columbia and Savannah rivers. It will become an important factor in the location of future atomic-power as well as conventional steampower plants.

POLLUTION PREVENTION

Over the past few years some of the giant corporations have begun to spend real money on prevention of water pollution. Du Pont which makes more chemical products in its far-flung plants than anybody else accordingly has a wider diversity of waste materials to dispose of. In dealing with Du Pont federal government agencies are dealing with an entity almost as large and complex as the state of New York. Something of this company’s style and resoluteness in tackling pollution problems can be perceived by a look at operations in the Charleston West Virginia region of the Kanawha River Valley. There are twelve chemical manufacturing plants employing 25000 people. Du Pont’s Belle Works alone resulted in over 300 sources of wastes feeding into about 3 billion gallons of cooling water per day then into some 40 outfalls to the river.

In 1958 at Du Pont’s urging 9 individual firms joined with it in cooperating with the West Virginia Water Resources Division and the U.S. Geological Survey in a quantitative assay of a 62-mile stretch of the river. Du Pont’s laboratories analyzed over 1500 samples each week for 6 weeks. As a result of this survey goals of waste reduction were set up. The biological oxygen demand has been reduced in Du Pont’s own waste effluents by more than 90 percent.

Most of the highly diluted wastes are directed to a large biological treatment plant where selected bacteria destroy the organic chemicals. Foam suppressants are added; the temperature and acidity are kept at the optimum. In order to cope with the extreme swings of the river flow huge tanks of 5-million-gallon capacity are used to impound the wastes when the flow to the Kanawha dips as low as 800 cubic feet per second. The liquids are released under state supervision during the winter when the runoffs may be as high as 100000 cubic feet per second.

Du Pont is quick to try out new techniques. In one of its plants on the Sabine River it accomplishes cooling by air from giant fans rather than by water. At the Victoria Plant in Texas 4 alligators are part of the conservation system. These were put on guard to repulse an invasion of nutria (small rodents) which were in the habit of sabotaging the pond walls and canal banks.

Like the oil industry Du Pont and other big chemical companies have dug mile-deep wells to dispose of salt water and other unmanageable pollutants. Some of them are successful; some are just expensive holes in the ground.

A common Du Pont practice in most of its river plants is to conduct waste water to “passport ponds” where it is checked for pollutants before it goes back to the river.

It has been estimated that since 1963 the entire manufacturing industry has spent 4 percent of its annual $14 billion capital investment on pollution control. In many instances the amount compares poorly with what is spent on advertising — for such products as detergents as a case in point — but it is much more than it was a decade ago.

There has been a noteworthy trend toward cooperation between municipalities and private companies. If a company is bigger than the town the municipal sewage may be accommodated in the company’s waste-disposal system. Thus the three small towns of Lake and Westernport Maryland and Piedmont West Virginia on the upper Potomac all send their raw sewage into the pollutioncontrol system of the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company. Conversely when a river or lake city has a large modern sewage system it will often contract to handle waste effluents from chemical companies. The technology of treatment of sewage and of organic chemical wastes is virtually the same. Main reliance is placed on bacteriological (activated sludge) processes in both.

Cooperation of industry with state authorities reached its height in the activities of the Ohio River Valley Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO). When this body was organized in 1948 with state and industry representatives from Illinois Indiana Ohio Pennsylvania New York Virginia West Virginia and Kentucky the Ohio was the foulest-smelling river in the land. At the time sewage treating of any kind was available to only one percent of the population along the river’s banks. Today treating facilities serve 97 percent though most of them handle primary treatment only. A good deal of progress has been made in dealing with industrial wastes but in general the standards remain somewhat lenient. Furthermore 15 percent of the industries on the Ohio have failed to meet even these lenient standards.

The paper manufacturers being on the whole the worst offenders have formed a National Council for Stream Improvement. What can you do with pulp wastes? As early as 1943 the Sulfite Pulp Manufacturers’ Research League started growing yeasts on waste sulfite liquor. Nearly every sulfite plant now has a yeast plant next to it. This is not enough however to make much of a dent in the massive total of wastes.

The Kimberly-Clark Corporation has built for a Wisconsin plant a 30-million-gallon evaporating pond to store spent liquor during the summer. When partly dried this material can be used in place of asphalt for road making. The company makes no charge and pays part of the hauling. At the Niagara plant there are not enough roads in the vicinity to get rid of the liquor in this way. There a soil filtration system is used. Sandy permeable soil is sprayed with the wet liquor which is carried deep into the soil by rains. When it joins the natural groundwater it has had the equivalent of a bacterial treatment for sewage.

Other companies such as Weyerhaeuser have experimented with the use of dilute spent liquor for irrigation in the Pacific Northwest. Sprinklers are used. Unfortunately this is too expensive a way to irrigate except for crops such as tobacco and they don’t grow tobacco in the state of Washington.

For the chemical industry a new type of consultant has emerged — the professional limnologist (the freshwater expert). Limnologists will offer services such as exhaustive surveys of stream biology and chemistry before a new plant is built and continuous monitoring of stream health after it starts operating. The consultant will give advice about which sort of waste can be tolerated by the stream and which cannot. The guiding principle of limnology is that in the water “diversity is stability.” As long as each of the major types of aquatic life (bacteria algae protozoa mollusks insects fish) is represented by a relatively large number of species each doing its ecological job. the self-cleaning ability of the stream is preserved whatever pollutant may be present. But when pollution begins to drive out or destroy species leaving some of the jobs undone the stream is hurt.

This is a new science only in the sense of being applied to chemical refuse. However there are still more unknowns than knowns. Chemicals can be experimentally synthesized and put into production much faster than limnologists can decide what effect they have on the animal kingdom (including people) or the plant kingdom. In the case of lead compounds from gasoline additives it took more than 40 years of universal use before they were found unexpectedly to be dangerous.

What incentive should be offered private industry to do a real cleanup job? One possibility is tax relief. Another possibility is faster write-off for investments in pollution-abatement equipment. The Johnson Administration is also considering pollution penalties of the same type used by the Germans in the Ruhr Valley.

RAW SEWAGE

In most countries the contamination of water with sewage increases as rapidly as attempts at correction. In industrialized countries the pace of water purification barely keeps up with increased loadings. In the United States almost 20 million people still discharge raw sewage to waterways. Existing sewage-disposal plants are adequate to serve only between 70 and 80 percent of the people who use them and there is still a huge amount of raw untreated sewage that gets into the Great Lakes and the larger rivers. The St. Lawrence Waterway has brought in more ships that dump sewage into the Great Lakes. Lake Erie can be regarded as one big sewage reservoir. The multiplication of large motorboats with “heads” that simply dump raw toilet effluent into the lake is believed to have caused more than one minor hepatitis epidemic.

In 1961 various federal installations discharged over 46 million gallons of untreated sewage per day directly into surface waters or on the ground: this was 3 percent of the total estimated 1.5 billion gallons of municipal sewage discharged without treatment but it was a very dirty 3 percent. The Marine Corps base at Camp Lejeune North Carolina so polluted the New River area that a serious epidemic of viral hepatitis broke out among the residents (including marines) who ate infected oysters. Chlorination of the camp’s sewage was clearly needed immediately but repeated requests for such action from state authorities to the Department of the Navy in Washington elicited no replies whatsoever.

The Navy has also maintained a stony imperturbability in regard to the incredibly filthy shipsewage conditions which it causes in Pearl Harbor Hawaii. Under present laws and without an official complaint from the governor of Hawaii all the Public Health Service can do is wait until the sewage drifts to the California coast whereupon Governor Pat Brown can summon in the federal agencies who have express authority over interstate pollution. That could take quite a while and in the meantime the principal harbor of our fiftieth state festers and stinks like a giant cesspool.

Other federal sewage scandals exist at Hamilton Air Force Base Marin County California; Elmendorf Air Force Base Anchorage Alaska (raw sewage); England Air Force Base Rapides Parish Louisiana (raw sewage to the Red River); Philadelphia Navy Base (raw sewage and industrial waste to the Delaware River); U.S. Federal Penitentiary Steilacoom Washington (untreated sewage and wastes from cannery laundry piggery slaughterhouse and milk-processing plant discharged to Puget Sound); U.S. Coast Guard Yard Baltimore (sewage from urinals and toilets discharged to 15 septic tanks 14 of which overflow to nearby watercourses).

Although Congress has specific legislation before it to put a stop to such disgusting practices it continues to be more difficult to get the military authorities to act than to persuade the municipalities. Cleaning their own sewage is not part of their “primary mission.” If the Bureau of the Budget narrows them down to a choice between a new football field and a sewage-treating project they will choose the football field.

A U.S. Senate committee has reported that we must spend at least $600 million a year merely to catch up with the need for nationwide sewagetreating facilities both civil and military. To meet present deficiencies and future needs will require $1.7 billion a year until 1980 and increasing amounts after that. This is a very conservative estimate since it does not take into account the installation of separate sewers for water runoff and for domestic and industrial wastes.

One troublesome drawback to all present sewage-treating processes is the fact that even severe chemical treatments leave certain phosphorusand nitrogen-containing compounds in the effluent water. These are nutrients for aquatic life and from that point of view are looked upon with some favor by the Fish and Wildlife Division of the Department of the Interior. However beyond a certain limit they become water-despoilers. They result in such a tremendous growth of algae (microscopic water plants) that the available dissolved oxygen is used up and the water is again a dark and unhealthy mess.

An interesting positive use of reclaimed sewage waters for growing algae is in making food for animals. At Lancaster California the North American Aviation Company has harvested algae which are high in protein and fed them to chickens which thrived.

A curious instance of the indirect effect of upsetting the balance of nature by providing too much marine nutrient is the disappearance of the once lush kelp forests off the coast of Southern California. The kelp has been devoured by sea urchins ravenous pincushion-like creatures which have multiplied in unprecedented numbers as the result of the vast sewage increase from the Los Angeles Basin. Maybe we can find something that will cat the sea urchins.

Who would want to drink reclaimed sewage water? This is a foolish question because millions of people have been doing so to some degree for years. More than once a sanitary chemist has stood before a group of city fathers with a glass of reclaimed sewage water on the table and bas said “Gentlemen this is the purest water you will have ever been privileged to drink. Here have a sip!” And everybody has slunk away.

Actually a large percentage of chemically treated municipal water throughout the country has been exposed to sewage contamination. Chicago’s potable water comes from Lake Michigan for example a sink for innumerable small and large sewer systems.

A case where sewage water is directly and deliberately processed into drinking water is that of the Whittier Narrows water-reclamation plant of the Los Angeles County sanitation districts. The plant takes millions of gallons of sewage a day from an enormous area. First the solid matter is settled out in the usual primary step; it is then exposed to activated sludge and is finished off with chlorine. At this stage the California Institute of Technology can find nothing wrong with it. But even so the Whittier Narrows water does not go directly into local waterlines. Instead it is pumped into spreading basins. There it settles into the groundwater supply of the county. Diluted by the natural groundwater it is then pumped into community faucets from wells.

Pennsylvania State University is doing some research on the use of treated sewage water for irrigation. The 3-million-gallon-per-day effluent from the State College community is put through filtration aeration an activated sludge step and chlorination to remove 95 percent of the waste’s biochemical oxygen demand making it nearly pure enough to drink. It is then sprinkled through special nonfreezing spray heads to replenish groundwater supplies in the area. Percolation through the soil results in removal of 99 percent of the phosphorous 88 percent of the nitrogen and practically all of the detergents. The success of this kind of treatment depends on the soil. If it is too porous the percolation time is not long enough to use the soil as a treating material; if it is too impervious waterlogging will occur.

We need not only an open-minded consideration of new concepts of sewage management; we need a new way of extracting money from the citizens. Bond issues and property taxes for sewers are reaching the breaking point. One solution would be to establish sewerage as a straight utility rather than as a tiny increment added to the water bill. A house owner gladly pays $11 a month for telephone service. Why shouldn’t he pay a somewhat similar amount to have his household wastes disposed of in a thoroughly safe and foolproof manner?

HARNESSING THE WATER SUPPLY

The amount of water on earth is virtually constant; hence the problem of an ever multiplying human race is to get it in usable form and to apportion it. If we could obtain rain where we need it or could even accurately predict where and when it would fall and in what amount we would have a start. Eventually we know we are going to need the oceans both for water and for atomic power but we are now faced with the question of whether it is best to meet local scarcities by desalting seawater or by impounding and transporting the huge reserves of fresh water going to waste in subarctic rivers. In the meantime the challenge of rainmaking has nagged us especially over the past 20 years and we are beginning to realize that one reason for our notable lack of a breakthrough in this field is that we don’t know enough about the weather. There are too many things about the process of rainfall that we don’t understand.

Tropical storms — and in fact all rainstorms — are nature’s way of desalting seawater. The great water cycle — evaporation from the oceans leaving the salt behind; rain; runoff to rivers with huge intermediate losses to the air by evaporation from the soil from lakes and ponds and by transpiration of plants — has turned out to be a most untidy way to run a planet occupied by 3 billion human beings whose demand for sweet water is insatiable. We usually get too much or too little at the wrong time. This is a fault of nature but it is our own fault that we waste such appalling amounts of fresh water chiefly by evaporation from irrigation canals and reservoirs.

Over the past several years an unexpected strategy developed by chemists shows promise for cutting down these evaporation losses. The trick is to add to the water traces of harmless surfactant compounds such as the higher alcohols which form molecular layers on the surface of quiet lakes or ditches and reduce the rate of evaporation by creating a micro-thin barrier through which the water molecules find it hard to escape into the air. This technique does not work so well in large windswept bodies of water since waves break the surface film. Results have been promising in Australia and in our Southwest in certain large-scale experiments. Improvements in chemically anchoring the film so that it is less easily ruptured are being studied though the high cost of the necessary chemicals is discouraging.

Most of the present costs of water especially as made available to the irrigation farmer are wholly deceptive. Such a farmer claims he will be ruined if water costs him more than one cent per thousand gallons. He usually gets it at that price but it is a gift from the taxpayers pure and simple. The farmer pays nothing on the amortizations of large dams and reservoir construction for which a considerable part of the expenditures consists in locating the impoundments or the conduits at such levels that gravity can deliver the water to his crops. Having one-cent water the farmer wastes it in leaking ditches and in excessive irrigation runs.

If we continue to evaluate irrigation water at the absurd price of one cent per 1000 gallons no method of desalting seawater or even of large-scale transportation of water such as the North American Water and Power Alliance (NAWAPA) plan for bringing the excess water of the Northwestern rivers of the continent to 33 states of the Union to Mexico and to Canada will be worth considering for irrigation. Pumping charges would make the price soar. We are up against social and political barbed wire packed with high voltage which may fence us in against considering any great continental water enterprises.

WATER FROM THE SEA

Critics of the desalinization program of the federal government have been quick to point out that even if water were available from the oceans at prices lower than what coastal cities now pay for water from other sources desalted seawater would still cost 10 to 15 times too much for the Utah or Arizona farmer. This point is important since among large water users it is only the irrigating farmer who actually consumes water. Industry and municipalities borrow water and dirty it but they do not consume it to any really significant extent. One can easily conceive of water-purification systems which would operate on sewage water and end the water shortage for industry and municipalities. Here the major problem is pollution which creates a scarcity of clean water. It is the farmer who cannot recover the water which his plants release or his soil evaporates who would in the long run benefit from desalinization of seawater on a gigantic scale but it is precisely the farmer who cannot afford such desalted water.

Before we decide whether such vast projects as desalinization plants powered by nuclear energy or NAWAPA are practicable we are going to have to concede that they will saddle the city taxpayer with a colossal burden of paying for farm benefits. Since the city taxpayer is already making good the difference between one-cent-per-1000-gallon water to the irrigator and a realistic cost of 5 or 10 times as much he may hesitate to make it a multiple of 30 or 40. In the meantime however as security against local droughts and as a substitute for much more stringent antipollution measures the city man is interested in desalinization.

In general for large installations some form of distillation seems to be the answer and where power can be sold and mineral by-products can find a market the heat of distillation may best be provided by atomic fission. For smaller plants operating on water of lower salt content than seawater the electrodialysis process in which salt is forced out of brackish water electrically through plasticmembranes is moving ahead fast and competes with the “reverse-osmosis” technique in which a separating membrane is also used but high pressure instead of electricity is the motive force.

President Johnson in justifying the research and development money he wants spent by the Office of Saline Water in the Department of the Interior ($29 million in fiscal 1966) has said we need new ideas. There is no paucity of them. The OSW now screens about 400 proposals a year.

None of the current approaches seems capable of making potable water at less than one dollar per 1000 gallons. City water in the United States now averages from 10 to 35 cents per 1000 gallons. However there are communities in this country and abroad that would think the dollar price a bargain. At least 1000 towns in the United States have to use water containing up to one percent salt. Seawater contains 3.5 percent salt.

Although many processes are being studied two dramatic changes in our ways of thinking about water desalinization have changed the pace and direction of development. One is the favorable theoretical economics of very large combined nuclear-energy and desalting plants. The second (and perhaps more important) is the concept of applying such a process to reclaim mixtures of sewage water and seawater or of sewage water alone. This may lead to an effective solution of the water-pollution problems of big coastal river or lake cities.

The importance of this notion is suggested by the vigorous counterattacks it has provoked from the coal industry which fears that coal may be dislodged from its last precious stronghold as a fuel in electric power plants. The National Coal Association the National Coal Policy Conference and the United Mine Workers write passionate letters to the President claiming with eloquence and bitterness that the nuclear processes involve government subsidies in the form of artificially low prices for nuclear fuels; that they may blow up New York City; and that even if they are successful they would put 5 men out of work for every man they put in a job since production of heat from coal provides about 5 times as many jobs as the production of the same amount of heat from nuclear fuel. In this last point they are undoubtedly right and indeed it is probably the strongest economical justification for nuclear processes.

If it were not for their manpower savings one might be suspicious of the correctness of estimated power costs from nuclear plants since the Atomic Energy Commission makes it very hard to find out just what nuclear fuels do cost. Some utility companies such as Consolidated Edison Company which has operated a nuclear power plant at Indian Point just below Peekskill New York maintain that the burning of uranium costs 22 cents a million British thermal units of heat energy produced while by comparison coal costs 29 cents fuel oils 33 cents and gas more than 40 cents. The Con Ed people think that uranium will be under the 20 cents mark in a few years.

This is for electric power. The dramatic aspect of these figures applied to water treatment has come out in the recent proposal of the Bechtel Corporation for a 150-million-gallon-per-day desalting operation for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. If electric power is produced at the same time from part of the steam evolved by nuclear heating and this power is sold at 4 mills per kilowatt-hour a going rate in the area Bechtel shows that the cost of water can be as low as 22 cents per thousand gallons. To match the 150 million gallons of water 1800 megawatts of power would be distributed which is enough for a city with a population of 2 million and is considerably more than the hydroelectric power yielded at Hoover Dam.

A week after the Bechtel study contract was signed San Diego had an earthquake. Evidently to quell superstitious fears of earth tremors releasing a mushroom cloud Bechtel recommended that the desalinization electric power plant be located on an artificial island offshore from Sunset Beach.

The Bechtel prospectus has naturally been closely examined by its enemies as well as its friends. There seems every likelihood that it will go through and that by the middle 1970s Southern California will have fresh water from the sea in enough volume to supply a city of 750000 about one sixth of the population of Los Angeles. This would be 50 times larger than the biggest current desalting operation which is located in the Caribbean island of Aruba and is run by Shell Oil Company. There is some doubt that the water from the Feather River Valley in Northern California which will start flowing southward in the 1970s will cost any less since over 400 miles of transportation are involved and pumping costs are usually estimated at 10 cents per thousand gallons per 100 miles. This water has to be pumped over the Tehachapi Mountains which separate Northern from Southern California. The Atomic Energy Commission has agreed to help California build a nuclear power plant to do this pumping job more cheaply.

In the meantime the state of New York rendered unbearably restless by its awful pollution troubles and a long drought decided to sign up with American Machine & Foundry Company for a small nuclear plant at Riverhead on the northeast shore of Long Island to turn out a million gallons of desalted water a day (enough for the needs of 10000 rural people) as well as 2500 kilowatts of electricity per hour and up to 500000 curies of cobalt 60 isotope a year. The latter is a new idea and may show some profit for plants of this size since cobalt 60 is in demand the world over for miniature power packages and for scientific use. For much larger plants the by-products could be minerals from the sea including chlorine sodium magnesium calcium potassium bromine boron and even silver and gold. Phosphate fertilizers could be produced as shown by W. R. Grace & Company by pretreatment of seawater with phosphoric acid. This would also reduce the scaling-up of evaporators with magnesium and calcium salts.

When the combination nuclear plants are applied to mixtures of sewage water and seawater a distillation residue of considerable complexity will result. Some decomposition of organic material might take place with the possibility of creating an air-pollution nuisance. However the use of standard chemical absorbers and auxiliary treatment of the overhead water would probably still make the total cost of producing clean water from such a witches’ brew reasonable in comparison with the present clumsy methods of sewage handling. The greatest virtue of such total treatment is that it would eliminate the hideously complicated murk of thousands of trace chemical pollutants which we suspect will otherwise haunt the lives of those living in our river and lake cities from now on. The use of nuclear power would also eliminate a large fraction of the air pollution which now comes from the burning of coal or fuel oil for electric power production.

Desalting of seawater involves an embarrassing problem that has not been entirely solved: What do you do with all the salt obtained as a by-product? In plants designed to furnish drinking water to a large city the sodium chloride residue would be huge. The only answer seems to be to pump the hot concentrated brine back into the ocean hoping that it will disperse fast enough so that it does not build up in the processing cycle and that it does not unduly pollute the continental-shelf marine habitat the most productive part of the ocean as far as salt-water fish are concerned. Probably there is more danger to the fish from the by-product heat than from excess salt. These questions need to be answered to be sure that we would not be replacing one form of water pollution with another.

RETHINKING THE PROBLEM OF COST

In considering grand programs such as a series of half-a-billion-gallon-per-day desalting plants or the colossal movement of waters such as proposed in the NAWAPA project we must develop a new philosophy of costs. The NAWAPA concept was proposed by the Ralph M. Parsons Company and has been introduced to the Senate Public Works Committee by Senator Frank E. Moss of Utah. The enormous amount of water running uselessly into the sea from Alaska Canada and the Northwestern United States would be collected and stored in an intercontinental system of reservoirs at relatively high elevations. By means of a reservoir-canal-river system the water would then be redistributed throughout the continent from Canada to Mexico generating power as it descended into the sea.

NAWAPA could provide 36 trillion gallons per year enough to irrigate 40 million acres of land in our Western states (more than is now being irrigated) and yield 100 million kilowatts of electric power equivalent to 75 Hoover Dams. It would bring the Great Lakes back to their normal level increase the output of Niagara Falls and open up a navigable canal from the St. Lawrence River to the Pacific Ocean. It would cost about $100 billion and take 20 years to complete.

NAWAPA is by far the biggest public works project ever considered. However it contains internal defects that should oblige us to reflect on our whole continental philosophy of water. NAWAPA would double our irrigation water supply but do we want more irrigated land? It would create a “Northwest passage” but what good is that? It would give Mexico the equivalent of an Aswan Dam but are we in the business of growing Mexican cotton? It would make the Great Lakes deeper but is that a good way to solve the sickening pollution of Lake Erie and Lake Michigan?

In a sense NAWAPA is an agricultural pork barrel for the farmers of three countries. It is based on the erroneous premise that we have a basic water shortage in most of North America. In fact we have a shortage only of clean water. Building a big dam and a reservoir for flushing purposes is one way to try to clean up a river. (The Army Corps of Engineers proposed it for the Potomac.) But it is a very inefficient and very expensive way to cope with pollution. It would not solve for example one of our most critical poison-water dilemmas — how to remove trace quantities of dangerous organic chemical wastes. There is another defect in this method of getting more clean water: storage dams represent essentially an irreversible action committed upon a river. The river is tied in chains. If you decide later you must treat the river water instead of diluting it you have already built your monument of concrete and must pay the interest on it. Acreage has been inundated.

For several decades the storage-dam concept has been fiercely defended by the sacred cliché that “electricity makes low-cost water possible.” This is certainly true where the electric power source is reasonably close to a large market for power as would be the case with nuclear desalting plants in coastal cities. But the easy hydroelectric dam sites are used up and it costs a good deal of money to transport electric power. The claim of the Reclamation Bureau that the taxpayers get reimbursed (except for costs that are written off against nonreimbursable aspects such as flood control or recreation) from profits on power has been disputed by modern economists. Some funny bookkeeping is involved since the Reclamation Bureau pays low interest well below the government’s rate on new bond issues. The NAWAPA scheme however would go a long way toward curing the pollution problem in the United States by installing proper sewage and industrial waste-treating facilities.

MEN WHO HAVE TRIED

In the field of water pollution there are probably no two more knowledgeable men in the country including all scientific as well as practical elements of know-how than Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine and Representative John Blatnik of Minnesota. Senator Muskie knows the problem as exgovernor of his native state and he knows how penny-pinching can block action. For example in his own town of Waterville a local sewer district was established; it issued revenue bonds completely rebuilt the city sewers cleaned up the tributary streams but found that because of the authorized debt limit there was no money left for sewage treatment.

The device of forming districts or “authorities” of several communities to evade the debt limit was invented by a Waterville lawyer and the idea spread over the country but this did not help lonely Waterville. On the other hand Allegheny County in Pennsylvania contracted for a $100 million sewage treating system to service 125 communities created the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority and issued revenue bonds; and every three months the Allegheny County homeowner gets a bill prorated on his water bill.

Edmund Muskie understands the terrifying rocky stubbornness of New England which would rather decay than spend money. He knows the story of the Merrimack River one of the dirtiest stretches of water in the history of the world. But the political history of the Merrimack is even grimier. Although the Merrimack’s pollution has been bemoaned for 80 years not one town on the main stem of the river has treated its sewage.

The Merrimack psychosis is the reason we need federal action. Until 1945 the Massachusetts Department of Public Health had no enforcement powers and could make only pallid recommendations to the legislature. But even the present control law has no teeth nor any provision for improvement grants. The Merrimack Valley is a depressed area and the textile industries that did not flee to the South let it be known that sewer rates would break their straining backs. Bond issues for sewage treatment were defeated by incredible margins: 5 to 1 in Haverhill and 7 to 1 in Lowell. Even the U.S. Public Health Service got itself involved in a scandal when it was revealed that one of its officials had promised the Massachusetts authorities that federal enforcement would not be initiated. In 1963 Governor Endicott Peabody requested federal help but the Public Health Service was refused data by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health which would not name any industrial polluters. In a public hearing an official of the state Public Health department became so insulting to federal representatives that the meeting ended in a donnybrook. A basic trouble is that the people are not willing to pay a reasonable price for fresh water. They have a vague notion that water should be free like air. Local water boards won’t charge higher prices to pay for water or sewage treatment because as the citizens along the Merrimack have shown at the polls the members of the water boards would promptly lose their jobs.

The Public Health Service had even less luck in New Jersey in the case of Raritan Bay. Here the details of the failure to act appear to have been hushed up but such men as Representative John Dingell of Michigan have pointed out that every federal agency involved showed dereliction: the Public Health Service because contamination which infected shellfish was being put into the bay; the Coast Guard because they failed to restrict pumping of oil into the bay waters; and even the Army Corps of Engineers because the Flood Control Act of 1899 gives them responsibility to take action when dangerous substances are being inserted into water. No attempt was made according to Dingell to control even the pumping of sewage from federal installations into this gray lagoon.

Interstate commissioners have claimed preposterously that the Arthur Kill is immaculate as far as Raritan Bay is concerned. Humble Oil Company American Cyanamid and General Aniline & Film have been dumping organic wastes from Arthur Kill into the bay for decades; and eight and a half years after formal objection had elicited from the state of New Jersey only a mild scolding Representative Dingell was so fed up with lack of action by the U.S. Public Health Service that he demanded that the function of federal water-pollution policing be transferred from the Department of Health Education and Welfare to the Department of the Interior.

Up to now the U.S. Public Health Service has legally been empowered to act only in cases involving interstate waters or at the invitation of the governor of a single state. But the Public Health Service has not been aggressive. The water-pollution authority is buried under layers of bureaucracy reporting ultimately to the Surgeon General. Organized like the Army the Public Health Service has a strong esprit de corps and a great desire not to make any enemies. In such cases as Raritan Bay it has acted with all the resoluteness of a wet noodle.

Both the House and the Senate heartily supported transferring authority from the U.S. Public Health Service to a new Federal Water Pollution Control Administration headed by an assistant secretary of the Department of Health Education and Welfare. In the Water Pollution Act of 1965 the House and Senate agreed on increased grants for sewer projects grants for water-pollution research and a general stiffening of the federal backbone. Will the Water Pollution Act do the job? Not unless it is adequately financed. President Johnson has asked for $50 million for a start on a program that might cost $10 billion over the next decade.

Without at least this much money the act will not accomplish what must be accomplished. It may prevent some future outright horrors such as Raritan Bay and conceivably even clean up the Merrimack River but it is not going to achieve the President’s goal of “preventing pollution before it happens.” It does not propose any really basic remedy for industrial pollution such as President Johnson’s suggestion of a “user fee” similar to the brilliantly successful system used in West Germany. It does not tie together a great national water reuse program with large-scale elimination of all types of pollution. It proposes a police action rather than a really concerted plan. It would add policemen but not planning engineers.

What must somehow be pounded into the heads of the people who govern us is that as far as the eye can see into the future our big problem in water is pollution. The problem of water shortages is a problem of treating dirty water whether the dirt is in the form of municipal sewage industrial waste salt or silt.

The difficulty is that dealing with pollution — in the broad sense involving for instance soil erosion and salt invasion of groundwaters as well as the more obvious and smelly modes of degrading fresh water — necessitates stepping on innumerable toes outside of a particular federal department. The more rationally James M. Quigley Assistant Secretary of Health Education and Welfare and Commissioner of the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration approaches his enormous job the more hisses and catcalls he will get. Even the hitherto mild and spiritless activities of the Public Health Service have caused tantrums of rage among the states among industrialists and among other federal departments.

Because of its polite remonstrances the HEW Department has been accused of a ravening will to power. If Mr. Quigley attempts to promote what is the most promising solution to urban water problems — the combined reclamation of sewage water and seawater (for example the reclamation of the Hudson River which would end New York City’s prolonged agony) — he will be regarded as a veritable demon. A demon is precisely what we need if the President will stand behind him. We need a man tough as an old saddle and fearless as a wolverine.

An alternative to one-department planning on a grand scale has always been a “council” or a committee. (One recalls the old definition of a camel — a horse designed by a committee.) In 1943 the Federal Inter-Agency River Basin Committee (“Firebrick”) was created to encourage cooperation between the Army Corps of Engineers and the Departments of Agriculture and of the Interior in studies of multiple-purpose dams. The members sat on their hands. The Corps and the Reclamation Bureau went ahead building dams as they saw fit and the Soil Conservation people continued their same tours of duty. In 1964 a Federal Inter-Agency Committee on Water Resources (“Icewater”) was set up consisting of representatives of Interior Agriculture Commerce HEW and the Federal Power Commission. These men have harrumphed and yawned suspiciously at each other but we still have no overall resources policy.

There is no agency in the federal government authorized to determine the policies make the decisions and give the supervision required for water resources development; and in the area of pollution which underlies water resources there is not even a shadow of such authority. The 1965 model was the Water Resources Council headed by the Secretary of the Interior and reporting directly to the President. This was a body hastily drafted to give the thirsting voters of the Northeast an impression that their troubles would be ended by virtue of a series of powwows. It shows no signs of establishing before the public the fact that pollution and water reuse are matters of driving urgency.

In the New York predicament the state has shown more insight than the federal government. Governor Rockefeller’s $1.7 billion program for abatement of water pollution if coupled with reduction of losses and installation of full water metering (New York City loses twice as much water in its transmission system — 400 million gallons a day — as the city of Boston uses) would go further to relieve the local famine than such airily conceived notions as diverting water from Canada. The plan to use salt water to fight fires in New York City will help.

Unfortunately the majority of the people and even a majority of the Congress still do not understand the gravity of our water-pollution problems. Cleaning up the rivers is viewed by many as part of the “beautification” program like getting the automobile junk piles out of sight. Improving the scenery docs not purge the water. In my opinion the League of Women Voters is doing the best job countrywide in educating people to the importance of the water problem. It has placed water pollution high on its list of “continuing responsibilities.”

To implement the mighty efforts needed in water reuse desalting and soil control we need a crash program exceeding the magnitude and pace of the Manhattan Project which developed the nuclear bomb. This is especially true in the research and development aspects of antipollution. Some tremendous gaps in our knowledge and know-how exist which must be filled by an immense acceleration of research.

As a professional chemist I cannot resist the temptation to point out one promising approach to the problem of organic chemical pollution which is receiving no federal money at all. This is the development of strains of bacteria or ferments that would selectively digest the trace poisons in industrial effluents. Private chemical and petroleum industries are working along such lines for their own purposes. Standard Oil of New Jersey for example has developed a microbiological process for converting petroleum into food. There are known strains of microflora that will selectively chew the wax out of crude oil or will chew the sulfur out of it. Dow Chemical Company uses selected bacteria to destroy phenolic chemical wastes. Maybe there are bugs that could be grown which would even thrive on minute but still toxic concentrations of endrin DDT and the other pesticides that are killing our fish and probably degrading our own livers. There could certainly be developed special microbic scavengers that would do a faster and better job in our sewage plants.

Research work of this kind needs to be done intensively and patiently with astronomical numbers of time-consuming experiments. And yet to my knowledge no system of experiments has been started with the specific goal in mind of controlling water pollution. We leave it to nature to provide the bacteria for sewage treatment but nature is not a sanitary engineer and nature is a great believer in time. Time however is of the essence. We run all kinds of races against disaster. Certainly not the least of these is the race against disease and ugliness — the race to clean up our once sweet waters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDI2NzAzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Michael F.

The construction of these ten hydropower projects allows India to fully use its water quota according to the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan.

The projects which the state-run NHPC Ltd is undertaking at Rs 68000 crore are among India’s plans to exercise its rights to prevent excess water from flowing into Pakistan.

Given that regulation over river water flow acts as a force multiplier during times of aggression these projects become strategically crucial against the backdrop of China’s controversial China-Pakistan Economic Corridor development.

To counter China’s scheme to divert water from the river that helps feed downstream into the Brahmaputra on its eastern borders India has adopted a similar strategy with plans to construct a dam at Yingkiong town in Arunachal Pradesh. Once built it will be India’s second-largest dam.

According to NHPC (erstwhile National Hydroelectric Power Corporation) chairman and managing director Abhay Kumar Singh the public sector undertaking is working on the 1000 MW Pakal Dul project 850 MW Ratle project 624 MW Kiru project and 540 MW Kwar project which are all in Jammu and Kashmir.

Furthermore India’s largest power generation company plans to construct power plants including 1856 MW Sawalkot in J & K 930 MW Kirthai-II in J & K 500 MW Dugar in Himachal Pradesh 240 MW Uri-I Stage-II in J & K and 260 MW Dulhasti Stage-II in J & K.

However Pakistan continues to object but the dams will be built in accordance with the Indus Waters Treaty said Abhay Kumar Singh.

Uri Kishanganga and others are constructed under the Indus Waters Treaty.

Pakistan had previously expressed opposition to the construction of Kishanganga. Pakistan took the case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2010 and the project was put on hold for three years. However in 2013 the court stated that the Kishanganga was “a run-of-the-river plant within the significance of the Indus Waters Treaty” allowing India to divert water from the Kishanganga for power generation.

Pakistan had also previously objected to the Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydroelectric projects on the Chenab.

In April the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved Chenab Valley Power Projects Pvt. Ltd a joint venture between NHPC Ltd and Jammu & Kashmir State Power Development Corp. Ltd (JKSPDC) to build the 540MW Kwar project.

Why does China’s dam construction on the Brahmaputra River worry India?

Relations between China and India have worsened since a clash along the Himalayan border resulted in the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in 2020. China’s plan to construct a massive dam over the Brahmaputra river raised tensions for India in the middle of this.

China is currently building a super dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo which eventually becomes the River Brahmaputra in India larger than any other dam in the world. The dam will be constructed in the Medog region where the Yarlung Tsangpo makes a U-turn and starts its descent into India. The dam will have three times the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam and is part of China’s 14th 5-year plan. For India the issue is not the amount of electricity produced but the nature of the dam and the river on which it will be built.

The river flows 1600 kilometres in China from its headwaters near Mount Kailash in Tibet then 900 kilometres in India first as the Siang then as the Brahmaputra before joining the Teesta and entering Bangladesh where it becomes the Yamuna and flows for another 300 kilometres until it meets the Ganges at Goalando.

China plans to build the world’s largest dam in south-eastern Tibet where the river bends sharply and rushes through one of the world’s most dramatic gorges.

The Yarlung Tsangpo gorge (also called Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon the Tsangpo Canyon the Brahmaputra Canyon or the Tsangpo Gorge) stretching over 500 kilometres is carved out of granitic bedrock which reaches 17000 feet above sea level in some places making it three times deeper than the Grand Canyon.

India and Bangladesh are concerned about how much water from the Brahmaputra and Yamuna rivers will be blocked by China’s massive dam in the Yarlung Tsangpo canyon. Some experts believe this is less of a concern because Yarlung’s longer stretch is situated in the rain-shadow zone situated to the north of the mighty Himalayan range. It receives significantly less rainfall than the river’s southern section.

But during the non-monsoon season India has no water in its catchment area and the river receives water from snowmelt. So if the Chinese build a dam and divert water during the non-monsoon seasons the effects will be felt from Arunachal Pradesh to Bangladesh.

How is the dam’s construction a wise decision?

The proposed dam in Arunachal’s upper reaches will be able to store approximately 10 billion cubic metres (BCM) of water. The project’s construction activities will directly and indirectly employ about 2500 people and help in the overall socio-economic development of Jammu & Kashmir. Furthermore during the project’s 40-year life cycle the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir will benefit from free power worth approximately 4548.59 crores and 4941.46 crores in water usage charges from the Kwar Hydroelectric Project.

The Indus Waters Treaty

The Indus Waters Treaty was signed on September 19 1960 by India and Pakistan and was mediated by the World Bank. The treaty established and defined both countries’ rights and obligations regarding using the Indus River system’s waters.

The Indus Waters Treaty states that whoever constructs a project first has first privileges to the river waters. The treaty establishes a mechanism for cooperation and information exchange between the two countries concerning using six rivers: the Beas Ravi Sutlej Indus Chenab and Jhelum.

The treaty grants India control of three eastern rivers: the Beas the Ravi and the Sutlej.",,,,,,

The report by a geophysicist who performed microgravity testing at the site hinted at an underground object with a mass of up to 9 tons and a density consistent with gold. The FBI used the consultant’s work to obtain a warrant to seize the gold — if there was any to be found.

The government has long claimed its dig was a bust. But a father-son pair of treasure hunters who spent years hunting for the fabled Civil War-era gold — and who led agents to the woodland site hoping for a finder’s fee — suspect the FBI double-crossed them and made off with a cache that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

The newly revealed geophysical survey was part of a court-ordered release of government records on the FBI’s treasure hunt at Dent’s Run about 135 miles (220 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh where legend says an 1863 shipment of Union gold was either lost or stolen on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia.

Dennis and Kem Parada who co-own the treasure-hunting outfit Finders Keepers successfully sued the Justice Department for the records after being stonewalled by the FBI. Finders Keepers provided the FBI records to The Associated Press. The FBI subsequently posted them on its website.

The technical survey data collected by geophysical consulting firm Enviroscan gave credence to the treasure hunters’ own extensive fieldwork at the site — and prompted the FBI to excavate in a massive secretive operation that lasted for several frigid days in late winter of 2018.

John Louie a geophysics professor at the University of Nevada Reno unconnected to the dig reviewed Enviroscan’s report at the request of the AP and said the firm’s “methods were very good” and “their conclusions represent a physically reasonable hypothesis” that gold was buried at the site.

But he cautioned the subsurface gravity anomaly that Enviroscan identified did not definitively establish the presence of gold. There are other technical reasons why Enviroscan’s data could have turned out the way it did Louie said.

“Thus it is also entirely reasonable that the FBI did not find anything at the site because there was not really any gold there” he said via email.

Enviroscan co-founder Tim Bechtel declined to comment about his work at Dent’s Run saying the FBI has not given him permission to talk. The FBI would not discuss Bechtel this week but said that after the dig agents “did not take any subsequent steps to reconcile the geophysical-survey findings with the absence of gold or any other metal.”

Other documents in the just-released FBI case file raise still more questions.

A one-paragraph FBI report dated March 13 2019 — exactly one year after the dig — asserted agents found nothing at Dent’s Run. No “metals items and/or other relevant materials were found” the report said. “Due to other priority work ... the FBI will close the captioned case.”

Anne Weismann a lawyer for Finders Keepers cast doubt on the FBI report’s credibility. She cited its brevity as well as its timing — it was written after Finders Keepers began pressing the government for records.

“It does not read like one would expect” said Weismann a former Justice Department lawyer. “If that is the official record in the file of what they did and why they did it it says almost nothing and it’s crazy.”

She added that if the government does not produce a fuller more contemporaneous accounting of its search for the gold it “will heighten my view that this is not an accurate record and this was created as a cover-up. And I don’t say that lightly.”

In response the FBI said the single-page document “is representative of the standard summaries filed when formally closing an FBI investigation.”

The agency has consistently denied it found anything.

Agents acted on information that Dent’s Run “may have been a cultural heritage site containing gold belonging to the United States government” the FBI said in a statement but “that possibility was not borne out by the excavation. The FBI continues to unequivocally reject any claims or speculation to the contrary.”

The trove of documents turned over to Finders Keepers also included nearly 1000 photos in grainy black-and-white that show some — but certainly not all — of what the FBI was doing at the dig site according to the treasure hunters.

Residents have previously told of hearing a backhoe and jackhammer overnight between the first and second days of the dig — when the work was supposed to have been paused — and seeing a convoy of FBI vehicles including large armored trucks.

The FBI denied any work took place at the site after hours saying the “only nighttime activity was ATV patrols by FBI Police personnel who secured the site around the clock for the duration of the excavation.”

Parada suspects the FBI retrieved the gold in the middle of the night and then showed the treasure hunters an empty hole on the afternoon of the second day.

“It’s very curious why the FBI is going to such an extent to misdirect and be so obstructionist on this” said Warren Getler who has worked closely with the treasure hunters. “They worked that night under cover of darkness to evade escape our knowledge of something we’re supposed to be partners in.”

Many of the FBI photos are seemingly irrelevant including the hundreds of images of random trees and a woodland road leading to the dig site while others simply don’t add up or raise additional questions assert Parada and Getler author of “Rebel Gold” a book exploring the possibility of buried Civil War-era caches of gold and silver.

FBI agents are shown standing around the hole in photos that appear earlier in the series but they are absent from nearly all of the later images at the dig site.

Getler and Parada say the lead FBI agent told them the hole was filled with water the morning of the second day but the low-quality images released by the government show only a small puddle or perhaps a bit of snow. They said that same agent spent most of the second day at base camp — where Getler and the treasure hunters say they were largely confined to their car — and not at the dig site.

The FBI said it’s standard for photos to “document site conditions before during and after FBI operations” Parada claims it all points to a clandestine overnight dig and a second-day excavation that was just for show.

“I think we were expecting a couple hundred photos of the night dig and I think we were expecting pictures of metal coins or bars” Parada said. “I think there were pictures but they disappeared.”

The FBI records also show that several weeks before the excavation an agent with the agency’s art crime team approached Wells Fargo to ask whether it shipped gold by stagecoach for the U.S. Mint in 1863.

Wells Fargo historians turned up no evidence of it but said records from the era are incomplete. Wells Fargo did ship gold by stagecoach a corporate archivist wrote in an email to the FBI but large quantities of the precious metal as well as gold that had to be carried long distances were “better transported by ship or train.”

Getler said the gold might have been transported by wagon not stagecoach.

Additional FBI releases are expected over the coming months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZtYWdpYy5jb20vcGdhLXRvdXIvcmlja2llLWZvd2xlci1yYWxsaWVzLW1ha2UtY3V0LXBnYS10b3VyLW5ldy1idWNrZXQtaGF00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rickie Fowler rallies to make cut on PGA Tour in new bucket hat,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 502 Server Error: Bad Gateway for url: https://www.golfmagic.com/pga-tour/rickie-fowler-rallies-make-cut-pga-tour-new-bucket-hat on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZtYWdpYy5jb20vcGdhLXRvdXIvcmlja2llLWZvd2xlci1yYWxsaWVzLW1ha2UtY3V0LXBnYS10b3VyLW5ldy1idWNrZXQtaGF00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAxNi8wNS8yOS9zdXNzZXgtY291bnR5LWxvc3QtbWF5LTI5LzQxMDE1NTEwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sussex County Lost May 29: Hamlet of Middleville,"Staff Writer

New Jersey Herald

The hamlet of Middleville located in Stillwater Township was known as Gin Point during the early 19th century and as Centreville from 1832 to the late 1850s. In the late 1850s the hamlet was renamed as another community in Sussex County (Centreville was later renamed Layton in Sandyston Township) was previously given that name and had created a considerable amount of confusion for the post office.

The first postmaster in Middleville was Hampton Andress who assumed his responsibilities on July 8 1846. Andress was followed by Robert H. Howell on Jan. 26 1852 who was replaced on July 15 1853 by Joseph Andress. Oscar Andress was the fourth postmaster followed by Simeon Yetter. Oscar Andress was reappointed to the position on July 26 1889. Edith C. Andress became the first woman to take over the post office on Feb. 20 1890. A little over three years later on June 30 1893 Arron C. Huff became the eighth postmaster of Middleville. Oscar Andress took one final turn at being postmaster on June 17 1897 and held onto the office for 61/2 years when on Jan. 15 1904 Amos D. Pettit became postmaster.

On May 16 1914 Victor A. Robbins became the postmaster shortly after he acquired the general store in Middleville. Victor stayed at the job until 1955 when his son Donald Robbins was appointed to the job. Donald operated the store with his wife Shirley and served as postmaster until 1987. Together Victor and Donald established the longest service as postmaster within one family in Middleville. In the last 29 years the post office there has been served by a number of Postal Service employees.

Located at the confluence of Stillwater Road (County Route 521) West Shore Drive (County Route 521) and Pond Brook Road (County Route 612) the hamlet had grown by 1860 to include a hotel a general store a blacksmith shop a one room schoolhouse a post office and about eight dwellings. Trout Brook which flows into the Paulins Kill River runs along the eastern edge of the hamlet.

By 1915 the population had increased to about 75 and the hamlet boasted both express service by Wells Fargo Company and telephone service. The New Jersey Industrial Directory issued that year noted:

""The village is situated in a very picturesque part of Sussex County and the climate is perfectly healthful. The entire region is devoted to farming and dairying. City visitors come to this region in considerable numbers during the summer months to enjoy its bracing and health-giving air. There are no industries of any kind although a fair-sized creek in the vicinity of the village offers an opportunity for the development of water-power. The village supports one public school.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdmFjYW50LXByb3BlcnRpZXMtbmV3LXlvcmstcmVwdXJwb3NlZC1hcy1hZmZvcmRhYmxlLWhvdXNpbmctMjAyMi010gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS92YWNhbnQtcHJvcGVydGllcy1uZXcteW9yay1yZXB1cnBvc2VkLWFzLWFmZm9yZGFibGUtaG91c2luZy0yMDIyLTU_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vacant properties in New York can be repurposed as affordable housing,"Alcynna Lloyd/Insider Alcynna Lloyd/Insider

The Big Apple's housing market is booming which has left the city with an affordability crisis.

At the same time the state's foreclosure and eviction levels are climbing.

New York state's so-called ""zombie law"" can help turn foreclosed properties into affordable housing.

New York is facing a crippling housing shortage but there are thousands of vacant homes across the state that could help ease its affordability crisis.

One group has a solution to turn these so-called ""zombie"" homes into affordable housing by forcing banks to complete the foreclosure process and return the housing to livable conditions.

Zombie homes are everything they sound like — decrepit dangerous and abandoned properties. But they are also a relic of the subprime-loan gold rush of the mid-2000s — a time when many communities of color fell victim to predatory lending practices that often ended in foreclosure.

The Local Initiatives Support Corporation a national nonprofit organization has funded and provided guidance to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development — which is responsible for developing and maintaining New York City's stock of affordable housing — to ensure banks follow the state's ""zombie law"" to restore vacant homes into affordable units.

There are an estimated 1.3 million zombie homes across the US and New York state has the highest share. As of 2022 thousands of these vacant homes are sprinkled throughout the state especially in communities of color. They are not only dampening property values and fostering local crime — the wasted housing stock is also contributing to the state's worsening housing shortage.

But there's a solution in the works said Jenny Weyel the director of Neighborhood Stabilization at New York City's HPD. ""We've brought successful lawsuits against banks who have let vacant homes deteriorate and now we are finding ways to renovate and resell them to low-income families"" she said.

New York is overrun with zombies

HPD estimates that more than 2000 zombie homes stand vacant in NYC alone.

As New York's housing crisis escalates prices are spiking and — in an eerie similarity to the Great Recession — people are losing their homes through evictions and foreclosures.

In 2013 a wave of foreclosures hit New York resulting in a surplus of vacant houses and homes hanging in the foreclosure process. When the state became home to the second-largest housing-foreclosure inventory in the nation the state attorney general's office introduced the Abandoned Property Neighborhood Relief Act which became known as the zombie law.

With the Local Initiatives Support Corporation's financial help HPD has used the law to force banks to make good on their promises of maintaining New York's vacant homes. The law — the first of its kind — could serve as a model for other states hoping to tackle backlogs of vacant and distressed houses with bank liens.

It requires financial institutions to maintain the outside of vacant homes that hold delinquent mortgages — fixing windows trimming grass and patching roofs — until a foreclosure process is completed. If banks disregard the law they are fined a noncompliance fee of $500 a day for each house.

And so far it's worked on more than 11000 homes.







Through the ""vacants initiative"" LISC and HPD have ensured banks comply with the law by tracking and studying properties — thus certifying that vacant homes are maintained properly and do not present a threat to the communities they plague. Their efforts have also led to new pathways for restoring these properties to affordable housing.

""Every vacant house restored means a safe affordable home for a family a boost to the tax rolls and an infusion of vitality and care for the block and the neighborhood"" Helene Caloir the senior director of the New York State Housing Stabilization Fund told Insider. ""It has a positive multiplier effect on the life of the community that you can see just by walking around.""

Success in Brownsville

A home located in the neighborhood of Brownsville Brooklyn is one of the city's biggest success stories.

In 2017 Wells Fargo owned the vacant home but had failed to maintain the property. HPD filed a complaint.

When it didn't receive a sufficient response from Wells Fargo the city demolished the property leaving the bank on the hook for the demolition fee. Seeking forgiveness for that debt Wells Fargo transferred ownership of the property to the City of New York.

By 2024 the property will be included in a Habitat for Humanity homeownership project that plans to transform it into affordable multifamily housing.

""With New York City's housing crisis we can't let homes sit vacant for year"" Weyel said. ""Zombie homes are a potentially untapped source of affordable housing. Families could be living in these homes and they could provide a homeownership opportunity for someone who might not be able to afford it."""

GUIYANG May 28 (Xinhua) -- As China rides the digitalization wave and seeks to tap into the full potential of the big data industry a megaproject addressing the soaring demand for computing power is taking shape.

In February China started work on the project to build an integrated national big data system involving the establishment of eight national computing hubs and 10 national data center clusters.

Dubbed ""East data west computing"" the project is a key part of China's digital infrastructure. It aims to coordinate the computing capabilities of the country's eastern regions where the need for computing is high with inland western regions where abundant renewable resources are optimal for the construction of data centers.

Simply put the project is designed to have less developed inland regions store and process data transmitted from economically advanced eastern areas.

""The construction of the project has taken shape and heralds a promising future"" said Lin Nianxiu deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission as he addressed the China International Big Data Industry Expo 2022 held on Thursday in Guiyang southwest China's Guizhou Province.

In the next step China will build and deploy modern infrastructure with a forward-thinking mindset and accelerate the digital transformation of traditional infrastructure Lin said.

BOOSTING INVESTMENT

Industry insiders have high hopes that the project will boost economic growth. By building computing hubs and data centers the project is expected to boost investment in the upstream and downstream industrial chains.

Statistics show that since the beginning of this year 25 new projects have been launched in 10 national data center clusters in China with combined computing power equivalent to approximately 27 million personal computers.

These new projects have attracted a total investment of over 190 billion yuan (about 28.2 billion U.S. dollars). Investment in China's western regions increased sixfold from the same period last year.

As one of the designated computing hubs Guizhou has decided to upgrade its digital infrastructure and plans to spend about 17 billion yuan on the big data industry this year.

Guizhou will construct a ""data corridor"" that will link it with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Chengdu-Chongqing economic circle to better meet the computing needs of the two areas said Jiao Delu chief engineer of the Guizhou provincial big data development administration.

A recent industry report has highlighted China's impressive advances in computing power noting that it has become the driving force in promoting the digital economy.

Increasing investment in this sector will have an amplified and long-term effect on economic growth said the report jointly released by Tsinghua University the International Data Corporation and Chinese IT firm Inspur Information.

""The country's move to channel more computing resources from its eastern areas to its less developed western regions offers a huge opportunity for enterprises"" said Yu Junfang deputy general manager with the local branch of China Unicom in Guizhou.

Yu said China Unicom plans to invest nearly 1.5 billion yuan in the expansion of its data center in Guiyang adding nearly 7000 more server racks to its current total of 3000.

SPURRING COMMERCIAL USE

Since Guizhou was approved to build the country's first national big data comprehensive pilot zone in 2016 the province has become the frontrunner in the country's big data industry. After years of development many data centers there have started to enjoy commercial success.

The Gui'an Supercomputing Center began operations in late 2020. With 537 servers and 1000 high-performance graphics processors the center boasts a combined computing power of 13.4 quadrillion floating-point operations per second ranking third among data centers in the west of China.

Peng Benqian an executive at the center's operating company said that the center has been promoting the commercial use of computing power and storage resources while meeting the needs of national scientific research.

In January 2021 Shenzhen Rayvision Technology Co. Ltd. a company that specializes in providing vertical cloud computing services for the visual arts industry became the first customer to purchase computing power from the center.

Subsequently the center provided computer power services for the post-rendering work of many films and television shows including blockbusters ""The Battle at Lake Changjin"" and ""New Gods: Nezha Reborn.""

By using the supercomputing power rendering work that used to take more than 100 hours can now be completed in one to five minutes said Dai Kaiguo an engineer at Rayvision.

Find out more about how we test .

Comparison Products

We compare the Lexar SL660 Blaze to other popular portable SSDs including SanDisk’s Extreme and Extreme Pro (both v2) the Samsung X5 and T7 the WD Black P50 the Adata SE900G and of course the Kingston XS2000. Two of these drives are at the 2TB capacity but this should offer no advantage in this drive class.

Game Scene Loading - Final Fantasy XIV

Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers is a free real-world game benchmark that easily and accurately compares game load times without the inaccuracy of using a stopwatch.

The SL660 Blaze is marketed as a gaming drive so it’s nice to see it delivers a very good result here. SSDs in general offer the best loading times and it can be nice to have a portable option if you’re on the go or if you use a gaming laptop.

Trace Testing – PCMark 10 Storage Benchmark

PCMark 10 is a trace-based benchmark that uses a wide-ranging set of real-world traces from popular applications and everyday tasks to measure the performance of storage devices.

The 1TB SL660 Blaze is in the middle of the pack here right alongside the Kingston XS2000. We see better results from the SanDisk Extreme Pro v2 which has DRAM and the Samsung X5 which utilizes Thunderbolt 3 and also has DRAM.

Transfer Rates – DiskBench

We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with a custom 50GB dataset. We copy 31227 files of various types such as pictures PDFs and videos to a new folder and then follow-up with a reading test of a newly-written 6.5GB zip file.

The 1TB SL660 Blaze along with the XS2000 is on top of the USB-based portable drives. It offers very fast transfer times and is only beaten by the ThunderBolt 3-equipped X5.

Synthetic Testing - ATTO / CrystalDiskMark

ATTO and CrystalDiskMark (CDM) are free and easy-to-use storage benchmarking tools that SSD vendors commonly use to assign performance specifications to their products. Both of these tools give us insight into how each device handles different file sizes.

Image 1 of 12 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Users transfer files of various sizes regularly with portable drives so it’s important to look at transfer speeds for different block sizes in ATTO. The SL660 Blaze only comes up short for sequential reads versus the Samsung X5 which again has a ThunderBolt 3 interface. It also falls slightly behind the ASM2364-based drives at larger sequential write sizes which points to a difference in controller limitations.

CrystalDiskMark that most popular of SSD benchmarks just shows the interface's limits for peak sequential reads and writes. We see a bit of a different story with random performance. Random write performance is quite good and the SL660 Blaze again matches the XS2000 while falling behind only the X5 at low queue depth. Reduced write latency may be a product of the hybrid design as writes require acknowledgment. However we see the SM2320 drives falling behind along with Samsung’s T7 Touch during a low queue depth read workload.

This is likely due to the controller being DRAM-less - the same is also true of the T7’s Pablo controller - which can exacerbate the limitations of the interface. Low queue depth random reads are often utilized as a guideline for general user experience yet we saw the SL660 Blaze do quite well with the Final Fantasy XIV benchmark - at least in comparison to other portable SSDs. There is simply a performance threshold where you get most of the gains of a solid state drive but portables are limited by interface. This illustrates why a DRAM-less design like the SM2320 can still be optimal for a portable drive and certainly so for gaming.

Sustained Write Performance Cache Recovery and Temperature

Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache which is a fast area of (usually) pseudo-SLC programmed flash that absorbs incoming data. Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the ""native"" TLC or QLC flash. We use Iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Continuing from the Crystal Disk Mark results above we can then speculate that a DRAM-less SSD may still have significant shortfalls as a secondary effect. This is clearly the case in the write saturation test.

Our results are very similar to what we saw with the XS2000. The drive writes at maximum speed or 1.8Gbps for approximately 55s for a total cache size of around 100GB. From what we understand these drives utilize a hybrid cache with 6GB of static and the rest being dynamic.

After the cache is exhausted the sequential write performance is very erratic. The drive is folding to native TLC which eventually frees up enough SLC for a brief spike in write throughput before falling back down. Overall post-SLC sequential write bandwidth is around 200MBps which is certainly not great and is reminiscent of some QLC-based desktop drives. The T7 Touch relies on a much smaller cache but then engages direct-to-TLC. For that reason it is faster and its more consistent post-SLC performance can out-write the SL660 Blaze and XS2000.

DRAM-less drives tend to have weaker post-SLC performance due to larger SLC cache sizes fewer flash channels and an overall design philosophy that benefits from the slower folding state. While the T7 outpaces the SL660 Blaze and XS2000 it still falls behind the rest of the drives in sustained writes and interface limitations squeeze it with shorter writes.

Cache recovery on the SL660 Blaze was similar to the XS2000 with the static portion recovering relatively rapidly and the dynamic portion requiring more time. However it’s a fairly reasonable response given how this drive will be used. Those regularly doing large sustained writes which could include videographers for example might want to look at a different portable drive but this cache should be adequate for gaming even in a fuller-drive state.

We had good thermal results from the XS2000 but we would expect them to be even better with the SL660 Blaze due to its aluminum case and interior design. This proved to be true as the surface was 5C cooler than the XS2000’s under load at 31C with the drive itself reaching around 7C less or 64C as measured by an IR gun. We certainly saw no throttling and idle temperatures were also good.

Conclusion

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

It is difficult for us not to compare the Lexar SL660 Blaze to the Kingston XS2000 because the internal hardware is similar and our test results point out plenty of similarities. The SL660 Blaze has a higher price point which is sensible as it offers more than the XS2000. For example it comes with an extra cable a detachable stand RGB functionality and software support that includes encryption. It maintains shock resistance but is also larger and weighs more. In a sense this makes it less portable but the aluminum body and overall design make it more attractive. Plus it remains sufficiently convenient.

This is being marketed as a gaming drive which tends not to mean a whole lot in the SSD space — for now. However the angular design and presence of RGB are probably sufficient to match the requirements of such a moniker. The detachable stand is also a nice feature when considering the possibilities of portable gaming even if used with a console.

The Sl600's warranty is strong and the drive feels durable particularly with the pouch which we feel is a strong selling point if you’re moving the drive around a lot. Although we question the usefulness of software encryption with a gaming drive software support is a nice touch but there are other options available that don’t require Lexar's proprietary software. We wouldn’t mind some OEM software for drive cloning though.

Aside from some minor pitfalls the SL600's performance is actually not bad for a portable drive. The one area it does fall short is during sustained sequential write workloads which exhibit very poor post-cache performance. The cache design itself is robust even if the cache is not particularly large but this issue will be more troublesome with a fuller drive. While this is not usually a problem for gaming if you also want to also use this drive to transfer files particularly larger ones some alternatives are more attractive in terms of speed and consistency.

Therefore the SL660 Blaze’s traits are a bit of a double-edged sword. You don’t really need anything special for gaming so what you are really paying for — versus say the XS2000 — is basically aesthetics. The extra cable and the standalone dock are useful additions but may be of situational use. It’s possible to get a cheaper drive if performance is your top priority making this a luxury item.

ADATA’s SE900G also offers RGB and the extra cable but appears to have a lower MSRP. Is it worth a premium for the dock and Lexar’s software package? Probably not but we do feel Lexar did a good job of making a product with a premium feel although we would have liked to see a 2TB option given the size of games these days. That being said the dock might be useful for certain users.

If you want a portable SSD with a “gaming” feel something that also feels a bit premium with the aluminum enclosure pouch stand and RGB then this is the ticket. We feel the market is inundated with gaming-oriented SSDs that are really an excuse to charge more for aesthetics and semi-useful features. We will say that it’s nice Lexar includes a ton of accessories but someone willing to do a bit of legwork can likely find something just as good for less money. The Lexar SL660 Blaze is for the gamer who has everything.

That’s how David Williams who works at a Dollar General in New Orleans describes the discount retail chain’s resistance to workers’ demands for better wages and working conditions.

Raised in the city’s Lower Ninth Ward Williams has worked at Dollar General for around two-and-a-half years. He says that his starting wage was around $8 an hour; it is now $9.25. Williams works part-time and says that paying bills on Dollar General’s wages is “a constant struggle.”

“I never know when I’m gonna have my next meal I never know when I’ll be able to pay my rent” says Williams. “I’m constantly figuring out if I need to ask for extensions on bills and then I’m not sure I can even hit the extension’s deadline. It’s a constant struggle thinking about this every single day.”

Williams is one of more than 150 Dollar General employees who traveled to the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Goodlettsville Tennessee on Wednesday May 25 to demand that company executives address low wages understaffing and hazardous working conditions. The workers were joined by labor advocacy groups such as the Fight for $15 United for Respect and Step Up Louisiana as well as workers from Amazon Starbucks Walmart Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.

Dollar General has enjoyed steady profits despite the pandemic and CEO Todd Vasos was paid $1.7 million in 2021 a 37 percent pay bump that amounts to 986 times more than the median wage of one of the company’s 163000 workers in the more than 18000 stores across the United States.

A recent report from the Economic Policy Institute finds that 92 percent of Dollar General employees make less than $15 an hour. Twenty-two percent make less than $10 an hour; Williams is just one of them.

The pandemic was the final straw for many of these workers who have begun speaking up about not only low wages but pervasive health and safety concerns. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) has cited Dollar General fifty-five times since 2016 fining the company a total of $3.6 million. As OSHA regional administrator Kurt Petermeyer said following a recent citation Dollar General has a “long and extensive history of workplace safety violations” and “blatant and continued disregard for the safety of their employees.”

Williams says that his biggest concern is the heat. He drinks two Powerades and a large bottle of water during his shift to stave off dehydration. When he speaks to management about the temperature in the store they often say that the air-conditioning is on and working and don’t seem concerned about the temperature.

“I’m pretty sure that when it’s that hot and you’re trying to do your job as well who’s to say that you can’t have a heat stroke” says Williams. Asked about working at Dollar General more generally he characterizes the job as “the ugliest thing you’ll ever see.”

“It’s a pain so unbearable that you can’t describe it. That’s how horrific this is. Enough is enough. Dollar store workers put too much into this to get paid as they do” he adds.

Faulty air-conditioning was also a problem for Mary Gundel a manager of a Dollar General in Tampa Florida who was fired after her TikTok about the company’s hazardous working conditions went viral.

“At my store I found mold in the cooler and we had to work without proper ventilation when the air conditioner broke when it was hot outside — and that’s just one location” said Gundel who also took part in the Goodlettsville rally. “As a manager not a day went by where we were properly staffed forcing me to go beyond my duties to unpack boxes clear store aisles or work countless hours in overtime. It’s appalling that it had to take a viral video of my store’s conditions for the corporate executives to begin paying attention.”

Thus far attempts to unionize Dollar General stores have been defeated by the company. In 2020 Dollar General shut down a Missouri store that voted to unionize. In 2021 the company retained union-busting law firm Labor Relations Institute paying consultants $2700 per day to beat a union drive at a Connecticut location.

Workers see the Goodlettsville rally as the next step in increasing pressure on the company. Coming as it does at a time when other low-wage workers in the retail sector are beginning to organize other large companies — from Starbucks to Apple Target and Trader Joe’s — Dollar General workers say that now is the time to change what has become intolerable.

“This is a very scary feeling but I feel like I’m doing something right not just for myself but for the people who live the same struggle as I do” says Williams.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy9ybWEtZ2xvYmFsLWxpbWl0ZWQtYXN4LXJteS0yMzMwMjg2NDEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RMA Global Limited (ASX:RMY) insider upped their holding by 6.2% earlier this year,"Viewing insider transactions for RMA Global Limited's (ASX:RMY ) over the last year we see that insiders were net buyers. This means that a larger number of shares were purchased by insiders in relation to shares sold.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.

RMA Global Insider Transactions Over The Last Year

The Non-Executive Chairman David Williams made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$1.6m worth of shares at a price of AU$0.19 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than AU$0.16 (the recent price) an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying even at a higher price. David Williams was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.

David Williams purchased 15.22m shares over the year. The average price per share was AU$0.19.

Insider Ownership of RMA Global

Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually the higher the insider ownership the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that RMA Global insiders own 58% of the company worth about AU$45m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.

What Might The Insider Transactions At RMA Global Tell Us?

It is good to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Along with the high insider ownership this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about RMA Global. That's what I like to see! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Be aware that RMA Global is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis and 1 of those is significant...

DURHAM N.C. (WTVD) -- For Sherry Williams this feels like a bad dream. In 2007 she founded Mothers of Murdered Kids after losing her oldest son at 21 to gun violence. It's still a cold case. Now her youngest son Jabari is gone too.

""He was my baby. Jabari was the one that always looked out for mama"" said Williams. ""We mothers go through nine months deliver that child and give birth to that child. I've had him for 21 years and someone just takes his life?""

According to Durham Police Jabari Eugene Williams 21was found in his crashed car Thursday evening in the 800 block of South Street. They pronounced him dead at the scene.

His mother and brother are both grieving this unexpected loss.

""A couple weeks ago that was pretty big. I got to take my brother and his girlfriend and mom came out. It was their first time voting"" Jabari's brother Deon Gagum said.

""The day before he came in the room saying 'ma! ma!' I said what Jabari? He said 'girl I love you"" said Williams.

They told ABC11 Jabari was warm spirited funny and sarcastic.

They're commending Durham Police Patrice Andrews for supporting them.

""She stayed out there really late with us last night. I know she cares. I think city council needs to pay attention and give her what she needs to keep this city safe"" said Gagum.

For Jabari's mother the pain this loss still feels unreal.

""Sometimes I'm afraid to turn the TV on because it's someone's child has been murdered. I know what they're going to go through. and here I am going through this a second time"" said Williams.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcHJlc2NvdHRlbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yOS9vcGluaW9uLXB1cmUtZXZpbC1idXotd2lsbGlhbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Pure Evil – Buz Williams,"Evil enters like a needle and spreads like an oak tree.” – an Ethiopian proverb

We just returned from a trip to California. One of our daughter-in-laws had an operation that required her to be hospitalized for a few days and we went to babysit the grandkids while she was in the hospital and recovering. While we may think that things are bad here in Arizona they are worse in the former Golden State. For a few decades it was widely believed and stated “where California goes the rest of the nation will follow.” It was at least partially true in entertainment culture business and education. Let’s pray that it is not true now.

Growing up in the 1950s and 60s California was a leader in so many industries. Hollywood was the epicenter of the entertainment world. Most of the major aerospace companies were located there. The California demand for muscle cars and for travel freedom had a major effect on the car industry. Later the demand for lower cost more fuel efficient autos seemed to have started in that state. Property tax reform fair housing criminal law reform if not specifically birthed in California at least matured and blossomed there. The “Three strikes and you’re out” law was a major cause for the downturn in California crime.

So what happened in California? Little by little evil took over. Small tiny weeds poked through the ground and began growing. Nobody noticed at first. Since no one pulled them out by the roots the evil kept growing and multiplying. People voted for it and elected the promoters of it.

To be fair the voters were often hoodwinked into voting for things that they never would have if they were labeled correctly. For instance a bail reform initiative named “Releasing arrestees without posting bail so they can commit more crimes” would never get voted in. If however it was described as “a reform that allowed ‘non-violent’ suspects to return to their families and jobs while awaiting trial without the requirement of posting bail” it would likely be passed by the voters.

That’s what evil does to get its way. The essence of evil is lying obfuscation and confusion. Political candidates do it all the time to get elected and not just Democrats. But in California the Democrats control nearly all elected state offices. They’ve gerrymandered Assembly state Senate and Congressional districts to ensure that they will always be in control.

Just look at the evil they’ve done in that state. Homelessness is way out of control (and like all progressive solutions the politicians’ answer is to throw more money at it). Crime is exploding and in many leftist jurisdictions they want to or have defunded the police. They call conservatives “science deniers” yet many claim that biological men can have babies “chest feed” menstruate and compete in women’s sports. If “wokism” wasn’t born in California it sure flourishes there. In many of the elementary middle and high schools they teach Critical Race Theory transgender issues sexual orientation and transvestite story hour. Then after grooming the kids with this garbage teachers will ask them to “pick their pronouns”. I know this because my 12 year-old grandson told about it. This stuff is pure evil. It is not only happening in the once Golden State but in most if not all states controlled by the Democrats. Some of this is already leaking into Arizona and other red states. We need to join together and stop it now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2xlc3Rlci1jb3gtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQ5NjMxMjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lester Cox Obituary (2022) - Niles OH - Holloway-Williams Funeral Home & Cremation Service,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/lester-cox-obituary?id=34963120 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2xlc3Rlci1jb3gtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQ5NjMxMjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

However that has changed today as co-working spaces see more multi-national corporations (MNCs) downsizing their main office opting to put some or all of their employees in co-working spaces across Singapore.

Experts and co-working spaces told TODAY that more MNCs are jumping onto the “hub-and-spoke” model where they have a smaller traditionally leased headquarters and co-working spaces.

This is in part due to larger companies adopting hybrid work arrangements allowing employees to work from both the office and home.

MORE BUSINESSES UTILISING CO-WORKING SPACES

When global risk management and advisory company Willis Towers Watson (WTW) had to review its lease terms with its landlord at One Raffles Quay the company decided to move to WeWork a co-working space provider.

This was because 97 per cent of WTW’s 265 employees indicated they were going to adopt hybrid work arrangements said Ms Choo Oi San Singapore country leader of WTW.

The company will be moving into WeWork’s newest office building at 21 Collyer Quay which will be opening in three phases starting July 2022.

It will have a dedicated floor “and slightly more” for employees with close to 100 desks. Meeting rooms for collaboration will take up 30 per cent of office space said Ms Choo.

“The advantage of using such a (co-working) model is that it provides us with the ability and flexibility to adapt to changing business needs quickly without a big upfront investment” said Ms Choo adding that some of WTW’s offices in North America has adopted co-working spaces as well.

“The membership to use the space is also shorter and we can scale up easily and quickly if we need additional space within the central business district.”

WTW employees can also work at other co-working offices supported by WeWork or use the community floor in their upcoming Collyer Quay office.

For co-working space providers like WeWork and JustCo they are getting more business from companies seeking flexible work arrangements post-pandemic – especially from MNCs like WTW.

WeWork has seen occupancy in its Singapore spaces increase by 20 per cent from March 2021 to March 2022.

Mr Balder Tol general manager for Australia and Southeast Asia said that WeWork had also seen the highest number of workers utilising its space in March 2022 since the start of the pandemic.

As the pandemic forced people to work from home or from offices with reduced capacity limits WeWork has seen a ""significant increase"" of members with more than 500 full-time employees in the last two years.

These MNCs now make up more than half of WeWork members in Singapore he said.

For its newest office at 21 Collyer Quay more than 80 per cent will be occupied by large corporations.

""Having gone through the pandemic companies are now more sensitive to their real estate commitments and this has driven demand for flexible workspaces like WeWork"" said Mr Tol.

Similarly JustCo foresees that demand for its co-working space will gain further momentum as hybrid work becomes a norm and more businesses with expiring fixed leases look toward flexible co-working spaces.

Mr Michael Sim vice president and head of JustCo Singapore and Korea said: ""During the pandemic we noticed that hot-desking became more popular as individuals sought a 'third space' outside of their home and regular office.""

The co-working space provider which started operations in Singapore in 2011 has seen large enterprises – which it defines as businesses with more than 1000 employees often with a regional or global presence – expanding their co-working usage.

While these larger enterprises had on average bought memberships for 73 workstations in the last quarter of 2021 Mr Sim said that number has increased to 85 workstations in the first quarter of 2022.

He noted that large enterprises and MNCs have made the switch to allow their employees to choose where to work across JustCo’s 18 co-working spaces which allows them to cut commuting time.

Mr Sim also said that some members have expanded the number of workspaces they lease from JustCo but did not disclose any numbers.

As for Switch a workspace-on-demand platform with booths across Singapore owned by JustCo it has seen an uptick in online bookings.

Switch has more than 100 work booths and 70 co-working space providers housed on its platform. It has over 60000 users across Asia.

""Our data shows more businesses have started to adopt Switch as part of their flexible working arrangements"" said Switch vice president (go-to-market) David Zhao who did not disclose how many businesses have adopted the platform.

""They would use Switch to select a specific location or conference room for regular weekly meetings while allowing their staff to work from home on other days... They only pay for what they use.""

Compared to the last quarter of 2021 Switch's bookings increased by 20 per cent in the first quarter of 2022.",,,,,,

This comes amid an already busy stretch of severe weather. As storms began to ramp up over 20 reports of severe hail and damaging winds were received by the Storm Prediction Center on Saturday. Winds gusted to 75-mph near Gillette Wyoming and Buffalo South Dakota.

The stormy skies made an appearance yet again Sunday evening and overnight with storms rattling portions of the central and northern Plains. Storms produced strong and locally damaging winds in far western Nebraska before unleashing hail larger than softballs near Taylor Nebraska approximately 90 miles northeast of North Platte Nebraska. Early Monday morning those intense storms advanced into South Dakota and Minnesota with a threat of damaging winds hail and tornadoes.

Flooding also continued to be a concern. Rainfall from such intense storms can fall faster than the ground can soak it in leading to a threat of flash flooding.

As forecasters have recently noted many of these areas have been slammed by severe weather that featured destructive winds recently. Earlier in the month a derecho blasted the northern Plains with 100-mph winds leaving two people dead.

The severe weather threat will continue through Monday night. AccuWeather forecasters expect the eastern Dakotas and western Minnesota to fall within the highest threat area. Early Monday evening a tornado was seen on the ground in Pipestone Minnesota while a report of tornado damage was reported around the same time in Forada Minnesota. The damage in Forada included a destroyed local home as well as the deployment of search and rescue teams. There have been no major injuries reported as a result of the Forada tornado.

Due to the issues in Minnesota over 20000 customers remain without power in several areas surrounding Minneapolis as of Monday evening electric provider Xcel Energy reports.

Monday's high wind gusts in the area took place in Appleton Minnesota (90 mph) Big Stone City South Dakota (70 mph) Brandon South Dakota (70 mph) and Tyndall South Dakota (70 mph).

However a more isolated severe threat may expand southward into Kansas and Missouri and eastward toward the Mississippi River.

Sioux Falls South Dakota will once again be threatened by severe weather after intense storms rolled through overnight. Other cities such as Omaha Nebraska Aberdeen South Dakota and Fargo North Dakota will also be within the threat area.

Much like on Sunday all facets of severe weather will be possible into Monday night. However the risk for tornadoes will be higher on the holiday and a few strong and long-track tornadoes may be possible. People in the threat area will want to monitor the latest watches and warnings in the event of intense and damaging storms. The risk of violent storms and tornadoes will continue well after dark in some cases.

Farther north and east near cities such as Minneapolis and Duluth Minnesota storms may form into a more solid line increasing the threat of damaging wind gusts. AccuWeather Local StormMax wind gusts to near 100 mph can occur in some of the stronger storms lieu of tornadoes.

Minor to moderate flooding continued along portions of the Red River of the North as well. Waters have remained above flood stage for many weeks following late-winter and early-spring storms with melting snow and heavy rain.

""With storms centered closer to the Red River into Monday night flooding will be a concern once again. With torrential rainfall on top of already saturated ground these storms will only worsen the ongoing flood situation"" Geiger explained.

Farther south heavy rainfall may be more needed. Much of the central Plains remains in various stages of drought. Ninety-four percent of Nebraska and 59 percent of South Dakota are under at least a moderate drought according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

But heading into Tuesday some of these drought-stricken areas may receive too much of a good thing.

The severe threat on Tuesday will shift south and east likely impacting an area stretching from the Texas High Plains to eastern Wisconsin. The southern half of this area however may see the highest concentration of severe storms.

High winds will be possible from these storms along with hail. Much like previous days the most intense storms may contain hail greater than two inches in diameter. Hail of this size can crack windows and windshields dent vehicles and damage roofs.

Isolated tornadoes will also be possible however the threat for strong long-track tornadoes will be lower than on Monday. ""Tuesday's storms will generally be farther away from the strong jet stream and storm system moving along it. This will tend to reduce the overall tornado risk"" Geiger explained.

In any case residents in cities such as Amarillo Texas Kansas City Missouri and Milwaukee Wisconsin will want to stay aware of the possible hazardous weather on Tuesday.

In addition to the severe thunderstorms flooding will be a hazard across portions of the central Plains as multiple rounds of rain and storms impact the same locations. While these storms will not be as large and intense as those on Monday Mother Nature has shown in the past that such a large outbreak is not needed to pose a risk to lives and property. Rainfall totals can quickly rise over the span of several hours as storms move through in a process known as ""training.""

The highest risk of flooding is likely to come on Tuesday however additional storms that are expected to fire on Wednesday may cause additional problems as they continue to erupt over part of the same area hit on Tuesday. With the ground already saturated and a large volume of water already in rivers and streams it will take much less rain to cause the same flooding impacts.

The threat of severe weather will shift farther to the east over the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes later Wednesday and part of the Northeast on Thursday where they will help snap a building heat wave with cooler and less humid air that follows.

(AP) — Two fires that merged to create the largest wildfire in New Mexico history have both been traced to prescribed burns set by U.S. forest managers as preventative measures federal investigators announced Friday.

The findings could hold implications for the future use of prescribed fire to limit the buildup of dry vegetation amid a U.S. Forest Service moratorium on the practice. They also could affect complex deliberations concerning emergency aid and liability for a fire that has spread across 486 square miles (1260 square kilometers) and destroyed hundreds of structures.

The two fires joined in April to form the massive blaze at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains in the Sangre de Cristo range.

One of the fires was previously traced to April 6 when a prescribed burn set by firefighters to clear out small trees and brush that can fuel wildfires was declared out of control.",,,,,,

Private equity meet multi-unit franchisees!,"Private equity investors of all stripes continue to like what they see in franchising more with each passing year. The search for opportunities to invest for a competitive return has accelerated a buying spree for stakes in multi-unit franchisee operations like never before.

“We’ve been blown away by the amount of opportunity we see in franchising” says Michael Esposito founder and co-managing partner of Franchise Equity Partners (FEP) which launched in 2021.

Private investors’ appetite for franchising’s scalable revenue stream has been gaining steam for more than a decade through outside capital investments in single brands. And more recently in the growing numbers of large multi-brand franchisors such as Neighborly and Authority Brands in home services and Inspire Brands Focus Brands and Yum Brands in restaurants.

Today as tech-driven multi-unit franchisees emerge amid continued industry consolidation private equity managers see similar synergies and high-return potential on the owner side of the business—and are striking deals with strong operators hungry to expand.

“I think private equity is taking notice and starting to do this on a smaller scale with similar principles behind it: the ability to share resources above-store leadership digital development and things of that nature and see that as an opportunity in a high-cash business” says David Blackburn CEO and COO of Southern Rock Restaurants.

As the largest franchisee of McAlister’s Deli Blackburn has looked to private equity for funding. “Everybody has to eat three times a day. We like those odds and if you can meet and exceed your guests’ expectations then you have every chance in the world to continue to grow that business.”

What PE brings to the table

Private investors who typically come to the table with deeper pockets and a higher risk tolerance than traditional lenders can provide franchisees with a fast track to growth. Depending on the goals operators look to use private equity’s influx of capital in various ways including:

expansion the opportunity to scale more quickly;

best practices and strategic transactions such as an acquisition;

resources to bolster infrastructure; and

as an exit strategy.

The influence of outside equity on franchise operations often extends beyond just a cash infusion adding value through financial expertise bolstering vendor and supplier relationships and improving training support and marketing through best practices. The move to implement higher-quality centralized systems across a portfolio of multi-unit multi-brand holdings has the potential to professionalize the future of franchising in transformative ways.

Brands such as Dogtopia are already reaping the rewards of private equity’s investment infusion with proven operators such as Jamie Weeks. Weeks a Dogtopia franchisee in Portland Oregon recently became the largest area developer of the dog day care brand as part of his blossoming relationship with Prospect Hill Growth Partners a Boston-area private equity firm.

In March 2022 in partnership with Weeks Prospect Hill announced the formation of Legacy Franchise Concepts (LFC) described as a “multi-brand platform focused on high-growth multi-site consumer services concepts.”

Weeks who teamed up with Prospect Hill to become the largest franchisee of Orangetheory Fitness spent 20 years on Wall Street. He knows what he likes—and doesn’t—in both private investors and franchisors and what he needs to scale as a franchisee for the benefit of everyone with a vested interest.

“I think we are going to be able to do it the right way” says Weeks executive chairman of LFC. “We’re going be able to put in place the processes and the things that are going to make the business better and tighter and the people who benefit are going to be the franchisees.”

Along with spearheading the operations and development of 72 Dogtopia day care locations LFC operates the global rights to the wellness concept SweatHouz with plans for more acquisitions in the health wellness and lifestyle sectors.

Weeks remains CEO of Honors Holdings where he forged his relationship with Prospect Hill in 2017 as an investor in Orangetheory expanding from 12 to 135 studios. He describes his partnership as being as close to 50/50 as you’re going to get.

“You don’t know who’s swimming naked until the tide goes out” he says. “Going through a pandemic with them [Prospect Hill] proved to me that they’re the best friend I could have ever chosen. I’m not saying they’re the only firm or that there aren’t other firms just like them. I’m just saying that you are defined by tough times and to me that’s most important.”

Challenges and opportunities

Establishing the parameters and roles before going into business “is the most important thing to do when entering into a relationship with a PE group” says Luis Ibarguengoytia president and CEO of Irving Texas-based Chaac Foods a division of Gauge Capital.

Ibarguengoytia former COO of Sun Holdings one of the largest U.S. multi-brand franchisees is no stranger to smart aggressive growth. His decision to partner with Gauge the Southlake Texas middle-market PE firm in his own backyard was “love at first sight” he says.

“We spent 8 months putting our partnership together without an asset to buy. Our central focus was on the relationship and the partnership first and we knew that the assets would come. I knew there was a lot of opportunity in the space. We just needed to go find it” he says.

Since starting with a “small” acquisition of 32 Pizza Hut locations in Ohio in December 2019 Chaac Foods named for the Mayan rain and thunder deity has grown rapidly into a portfolio of 169 stores in 10 states covering 8 restaurant brands and a bustling development pipeline.

Partners for growth

When Esposito and co-founder and managing partner Scott Romanoff decided to form investing platform Franchise Equity Partners (FEP) after nearly 30 years at Goldman Sachs they wanted to do something different. Backed by HPS Investment Partners which has more than $80 billion of assets under management they launched FEP to create a pool of capital that would be differentiated unique and attractive to franchisors and franchisees.

Based in New York FEP a portfolio company of investment funds managed by HPS is bullishly ready to fill the void it sees in financial equity-based options for strong multi-unit franchisees. Their plan is to make $1 billion in “passive permanent minority equity investments” of up to 20 franchise businesses over the next 3 years.

“We think franchising is 10% of GDP” says Esposito. “I can promise that not anywhere near 10% of institutionalized capital when it is allocated is going to franchising. We think it’s a big opportunity.” And their plan to hold minority passive and permanent positions in each brand is purposeful with a particular emphasis on “permanent” says Esposito.

“We do not consider ourselves private equity at the investment level. We have no ability to force an owner to sell the business” says Esposito. “We are not in the business of flipping these things every 5 years. If the owner wants to sell the business in 5 years that’s fine. Get us a good price and we’ll be happy. But we will not be able to pull the trigger and force the sale of the company.”

FEP plans to partner with established operators in five investment areas: auto dealerships restaurants heavy equipment dealerships beverage distributors and consumer services such as health and beauty. Each vertical must have an experienced operating partner “embedded in the ecosystem” to help “drive business impact and meaningful value for the firm’s portfolio companies” says Esposito.

Among the company’s early investments is a slice of one of the country’s largest Taco Bell franchisees Pacific Bells acquired by the private equity firm Orangewood Partners in November 2021. Under the deal Pacific Bells’ founder and CEO Tom Cook and others on the management team retained a significant minority stake in the company and continue to operate the restaurants.

What to expect from PE

The private-equity funding world is vast and varied. Culture concept appetite for growth and level of preferred outside involvement must line up with a firm’s expertise and strategic approach. The expectations of these investors may also be far different than what franchisees have dealt with before.

When you engage with the world of PE your business will be evaluated on the potential return on capital measured against the potential ROI from an investment in any other industry or business—not just restaurants “but any other investment that could yield the return sought by the investor group” says Ibarguengoytia. “Restaurants do not have big margins and the company has to be extremely efficient to stay competitive with all other options available to investors.”

“There are private equity firms that live by the data live by Excel and don’t really get into the weeds of the human capital side” adds Weeks. “And then you have the private equity firms that are 50% data-driven with the other 50% human capital. To me those are the firms you want to choose to work with if you’re a founder operator or CEO. In the world we live in today it’s much more about the human capital than it is the data and Excel sheets.”

Make yourself attractive to PE

Although a new franchise deal with a private equity stake seems to make the headlines every day bringing on an investment partner is not for everyone for various reasons starting with size.

“I think that it’s difficult for a mom-and-pop. And I don’t mean that in any bad way. It’s just that it’s going to take more than owning three or four stores or studios” says Weeks. “You must have the ability to scale a model to 20 40 60 80 stores and studios. And if you don’t have that it’s going to be difficult. But if you do and have the white space and the team in place then I think there are opportunities for private equity firms to come into these brands and help a franchisee expand and get much bigger. It’s not going to stop anytime soon.”

Multi-unit franchisees that have been quick to adapt to meet the consumer’s changing needs with technology delivery and drive-thru efficiencies can more easily capture the attention of outside capital investors.

“Their investment in technology whether it’s organic whether it’s even through acquisition that matters to us” said Sam Banon principal at Gauge Capital on an episode of the Gauge Capital Podcast. “In a tight labor market with wage inflation having more technology and being able to lean on automation helps us generate cash. So we really are appreciative of the franchisors that are spending their cash on investing in technology.”

FEP looks to team up with “super strong operators” with 50 to 75 stores for the foreseeable future says Esposito adding that while they are “open for business” with anyone who fits their criteria it still comes down to ethics and partnership.

“At the end of the day these are incredible personal decisions on the part of the owner” says Esposito. “From our standpoint if we’re going to be a minority if we are going passive and we’re going to be permanent we really want to partner with people we like and trust.”

Even if you’re not ready to dive into a partnership with private equity relationships can be cultivated for the future. Blackburn advises his fellow franchisees to create a list of potential financial partners. Meet with lenders make phone calls and attend gatherings such as Franchise Update Media’s Multi-Unit Franchising Conference to build relationships and keep potential financial partners or investors updated on your company’s growth and development.

“As lenders watch you grow at some point they’re going to be interested in investing in you; or they will give you advice on where to send you to someone who can” says Blackburn. “I want everybody to be hungry for what I’m doing so when the time comes they all know who I am and where we’ve been. I think that makes a difference.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3QucGgvZWF0ZHJpbmsvdGhlLWxhdGVzdC1lYXQtZHJpbmsvODk0MzIvdG9wLTEwLWtvcmVhbi1mcmllZC1jaGlja2VuLXNob3BzLWluLW1hbmlsYS1hNTAzMS0yMDIyMDUyOS1sZnJt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best Korean Fried Chicken Shops in Manila,"(SPOT.ph) Fried chicken is admittedly a very comforting dish. Our childhoods consisted of enjoying it at every single birthday party (not just yours but literally everyone’s) and fighting over the last piece of chicken skin. As we grew up fried chicken wasn’t just a birthday treat it became a staple during casual hangouts with friends game nights or simply when we’re craving something greasy.

There are a lot of ways to cook fried chicken and in the past few years a popular form emerged in the way of the Korean style. It is often referred to as chimaek since Korean fried chicken is best paired with a cold bottle of maekju or beer.

For the best KFC (Korean fried chicken) in town we looked at accessibility delivery options flavor tenderness skin to meat ratio crunch and of course whether they offer half and half (two flavors in one!).

10. Wonder Chicken

Wonder Chicken’s Mix and Match (P590) gives you two flavors in one go. Their Soy Garlic might be a tad too salty for someone that does not like salty food but is something that can be overlooked given that the chicken retains its crunch despite being saturated in the soy garlic sauce. On the other hand their Yangnyeon chicken is similar to chicken doused with a sweet chili sauce instead of the traditional spiciness you’d get with gochujang. You also get bang for your buck as the portions are a lot (think five to six pieces per flavor).

Wonder Chicken is available for delivery via GrabFood FoodPanda and Pickaroo.

Let’s admit it no chicken spot is the same. Some might be right up your alley with the perfect skin-to-meat ratio while some pack in the crunch with tons of breading instead. In the case of Samsam Chicken’s Half/Half Boneless Chickin (P264) there was more skin than chicken which tends to take points off for the author but in this case is being offset by the fact that their Yangnyeom flavor was just the right amount of spicy it doesn’t burn your nose and it’s a good starting point for those keen to try spicy Korean fare. Their Soy Chicken flavor was more on the sweeter side than salty. The price point of P264 for a medium-sized half and half order makes it a good starting point for would-be explorers of Korean fried chicken.

One of the more accessible chicken shops on this list Kko Kko serves big portions of fried chicken—we’re talking “as big as the one you eat at home” levels. The Original (P428) is very reminiscent of your typical Pinoy-style fried chicken–the golden and crunchy kind that your grandmother used to feed you–and provides a very satisfying crunch. The Yangyeon (P448) on the other hand is not for the faint of heart. It has a distinct spicy scent that is typical of Korean dishes the kind that would make your nose burn if you’re not used to it. However it’s not the end of the world—upon biting into the spicy chicken you’d be surprised to also find a hint of sweetness mixed together which balances the spice that the gochujang brings in. Kko Kko does not offer half and half portions of the chicken.

7. Chicken Chingu

Despite being served in separate containers Chicken Chingu does offer half and half! The aptly named Party (P568) bundle gives you 14 pieces of crisp and juicy boneless chicken thighs. Their Original flavor is nicely seasoned with just a hint of saltiness while their Spicy Yangnyeon 1 (yep you’ve read that right it has a spice level!) is perfect for beginners with its sweet and spice flavor profile. The chicken also has just the right amount of breading to make it slightly crunch without overpowering the skin-to-meat ratio making it just the right size for you to finish it in one-to-two bites.

6. Mukbang Chicken

You’ll definitely want to do a mukbang with this chicken joint! Their Half and Half Boneless Fried Chicken (P540) gives you 14 humongous cuts of chicken thigh. Their Original flavor is lightly breaded so that it does not scratch your palate as you bite into your steaming hot chicken. It also has a nice taste that’s not too salty nor is it underseasoned. Their take on the OG Korean flavor Yangnyeom is one that starts off sweet but slowly builds into spice the more you take a bite. Don’t worry though if you can’t handle the spice you can just easily take a sip of milk or chug a whole glass of beer that we know is right beside you.

5. Yum Yum Chicken

Yum Yum’s Boneless Half and Half Chicken (P585) was more skin than meat. However that does not discount its ranking in this list. Similar to another chicken spot ranked on this list (we’re talking about 24 Chicken) their Yangnyeom chicken has just the right amount of spice something that half of the population (those that are not into death-defying spice levels) would appreciate. But if you’re the type to want spice in your life this is still the perfect order for you as it’s the kind that slowly builds but does not overwhelm your taste buds. Their Fried Chicken on the other hand is a pretty good dupe (if such a term exists in the food world) for Jolibee’s fried chicken. It has a great crunch and even tastes better when paired with the pepper-y gravy it comes with.

4. BOK Korean Fried Chicken

Like Awkwafina’s popular line in the movie Crazy Rich Asians this chicken joint certainly deserves a “bok bok b*tch” moment. While the joint doesn’t offer a half and half like some of the places on this list it’s pretty much forgivable given that they offer individual half orders. We suggest going with their Original (P289) flavor which is one of the closest in terms of texture and flavor to chicken you can get in Seoul South Korea. Meanwhile BOK’s version of Yangyeun (P309) has a tolerable and mild spice that can easily be controlled by how much minced garlic you add to your chicken.

If there’s such a thing as a chicken gang well sign us up! Gang Gang Chicken is one of those chicken spots that will surprise you. Their Half and Half (P598) is on the pricier side but we promise it’s worth it. Get yourself the Original which is nicely seasoned (and boneless!). It has the right amount of breading that it also does not scratch your palate and the skin is not overly crispy just the right amount. If it’s a spice world that you want shoot your shot with their Gangnyeon their take on the basic spicy Korean fried chicken that at first sniff would make you wish you were never born. Yep it smells that spicy. But if you do decide to take the plunge you’d be surprised that scents can be as deceiving as this chicken is actually tolerable for those that get weak in the knees whenever spicy food is mentioned.

If you haven’t tried 24 Chicken then you’ve probably missed out on half of your life already. We’ve talked about this small chick turned big-time bird before and we still stand by our statement that it’s still one of the tastier chicken places in Manila. Grab yourself an order of the Original (starts at P215) with its crunchy and well-seasoned skin. If you’re feeling a bit braver you might want to give one of their bestsellers a try. The Yangnyeom with Garlic (starts at P230) has a good balance of savory chicken and a slight tinge of heat that isn’t too intense but can be built upon with additional servings of minced garlic or by swiping your chicken in additional sauce at the bottom of the container.

1. Yang Gang

Despite not serving half and half portions Yang Gang takes the number one spot as the best Korean fried chicken place in the Metro. Reward yourself after a long work week with their OG (starts at P249) an unglazed chicken with dry rub seasoning that brings forth a truly umami-rich profile. Its crunch level is also one for the books given that it stays crunchy despite you leaving your chicken out in the open for a couple of hours. Yang Gang’s take on Yangnyeom (starts at P249) should not be taken for granted either. This glazed piece of chicken is smothered in the spicy gochujang sauce yet it maintains a mild spice level that most would come to appreciate. You wouldn’t want spicy food to be overkill after all.

Det är ett efterlängtat besked som innebär stora tillväxtmöjligheterna för bolaget på andra sidan Atlanten.

Bonesupport Börskurs: 5700 kr Antal aktier: 655 m Börsvärde: 3 734 Mkr Nettokassa: 174 Mkr VD: Emil Billbäck Ordförande: Lennart Johansson

Bonesupport (57 kr) är ett medicinteknikbolag som utvecklar och säljer biokeramiska material som ombildas till kroppseget ben. På branschspråk kallas fältet för ortobiologi och handlar om att behandla skelettskador.

Bolagets produkt Cerament finns på marknaden sedan 2005 och kan användas av ortopediska kirurger för fyllnad av hålrum i ben som uppstått vid skador eller sjukdom så kallad bentransplantation.

Bruttomarginalen är hög runt 90%. Bonesupports produkter har använts vid cirka 70 000 kirurgiska ingrepp i fler än 20 länder. De vanligast förekommande ingreppen är fot- och ankelkirurgi samt så kallade enstegsoperationer i samband med beninfektion.

I USA och i de största länderna i Europa sker varje år ungefär 4 miljoner behandlingar av patienter som lider av bensjukdomar eller trauma som skapat hålrum i ben. Den traditionella behandlingsmetoden kallas autograft och går ut på att patientens egen benvävnad används. Toleransen och läkningen är oftast god.

Kruxet med metoden är att ett extra kirurgiskt ingrepp behövs för att kirurgen ska kunna ta benvävnad från patienten vanligtvis från höftbenet. Varje ingrepp tar extra operationsresurser från vården. Dessutom ökar risken för infektioner vilket kan leda till längre vårdtider och lidande för patienten (i form av kronisk smärta) men även ökade kostnader för sjukvården.

En annan metod kallas allograft. Det innebär att benvävnaden tas från donatorer både levande och avlidna. Risken med denna metod är att sjukdomar som hepatit B och C kan överföras. Ytterligare en metod är DBM (Demineraliserad benmatrix) vilket är en slags bearbetad form av allograft.

På senare år har syntetiska material vunnit mark. Bonesupports produkt Cerament är ett injicerbart syntetiskt bensubstitut som sprutas in lokalt härdar och ombildas till kroppseget ben på 6-12 månader. Vanligen injiceras 8-10 milliliter med en speciell spruta.

Cerament kan kombineras med läkemedel och finns tillgängligt som kombinationsprodukt med två olika sorters antibiotika Cerament G (gentamicin) samt Cerament V (vancomycin). Det är en stor klinisk fördel. Möjligheten att leverera höga doser antibiotika lokalt är nämligen värdefullt för att bekämpa och förebygga beninfektion som ofta är ett besvärligt problem för många patienter. Cerament är dessutom synligt på röntgen.

Studiebakslag i höstas

I höstas pressades Bonesupport rejält på börsen och aktien mer än halverades. Anledningen var att resultaten för en av bolagets studier kallad Fortify utlästes. Resultaten var icke konklusiva vilket innebär att det inte gick att dra några statistiskt säkerställda slutsatser av studien. En förklaring var att andelen patienter som avslutade studien i förtid och avvek från uppföljning var hela 29%. Nästan en tredjedel (knappt 60 personer) av de totalt 200 personer som deltog i studien deltog inte i uppföljningen.

Fortify-studien startades i februari 2017 och syftet var att samla in kliniska data för att kunna erhålla FDA-godkännande för Cerament G i USA för exempelvis indikationen trauma. Den primära säkerhetsparametern för Cerament G uppfylldes däremot. Men godkännande för indikationen trauma i USA försenades alltså.

Studiebakslaget i höstas innebar att Bonesupport inte nådde upp till kraven för en så kallad PMA-ansökan (marknadsgodkännande för medicintekniska produkter klass 3) i USA. Bonesupport arbetar nu vidare med att granska regulatoriska alternativ för Cerament G och en rad indikationer där indikationen trauma är prioriterad. Ett alternativ är att ansöka om ett 510-K-godkännande i USA. Potentiellt skulle Bonesupport kunna skicka in en sådan ansökan om cirka 12 månader och kunna ha ett produktgodkännande på plats hösten 2023. Istället för att gå genom den mer komplicerade och mer omfattande De Novo-processen.

Cerament G är sedan 2013 godkänt för försäljning i Europa (CE-märkning) och står tillsammans med Cerament V för drygt 80% av intäkterna i Europa. Cerament BVF alltså produktversionen som säljs utan gentamicin och vancomycin är tillgänglig för försäljning i USA.

Viktigt FDA-godkännande

Häromveckan kom ett efterlängtat och mycket positivt besked för en annan indikation. Amerikanska läkemedelsmyndigheten FDA beviljade nämligen Bonesupport godkännande för bolagets antibiotikafrisättande produkt Cerament G för indikationen beninfektion (osteomyelit) i USA.

VD Emil Billbäck beskriver godkännandet som den hittills viktigaste milstolpen i bolagets kommersiella historia. Cerament G har erhållit marknadsgodkännande enligt De Novo vilket är ett av de tillgängliga regulatoriska ansökningsmetoderna som kan användas när det inte finns någon jämförbara etablerad behandling. Cerament G erhöll en så kallad ”Breakthrough device” status då produkten anses tillföra ett betydande kliniskt värde.

Antalet patienter som behandlas för beninfektion i USA uppgår till cirka 50 000 årligen och spås öka med 5-7% varje år. Marknaden är värd cirka 100 miljoner dollar per år för indikationen beninfektion. Varje år sker cirka 150 000 amputationer i USA av ben. Vanlig orsaker är just trauma öppna frakturer och beninfektion.

En undersökning bland kirurger i USA visar att hela 94% av kirurgerna som utför behandlingar mot beninfektion är missnöjda eller vill ha tillgång till alternativa behandlingssätt. Behovet av en produkt likt Cerament G verkar alltså vara betydande.

Bonesupport kommer lansera Cerament G i USA under hösten troligen under september-oktober. Bolaget har erhållit kostnadsersättning (reimbursement) för Cerament G (cirka 4900 dollar). Listpriset väntas uppgå till 5200 – 5800 dollar.

I dagsläget har Bonesupport via sina distributörer cirka 370 säljare som är ute och marknadsför och säljer Cerament i USA. Marknadspotentialen för Cerament G är större och potentiellt skulle säljorganisationen kunna omfatta cirka 500 säljare. Cerament G är en dyrare produkt jämfört med Cerament BVF.

Stark tillväxt

Tidigare hade Bonesupport ett distributionsavtal med den amerikanska medicinteknikjätten Zimmer Biomet som skötte bolagets försäljning i USA. Våren 2018 när nuvarande VD Emil Billbäck tillträdde genomförde bolaget en strategisk översyn och avslutade samarbetet med Zimmer Biomet.

Tillväxttakt USA Europa 2018 -56% 22% 2019 99% 40% 2020 47% -7% 2021 22% 12% Q1 2022 64% 28%

Senaste åren har Bonesupport byggt upp en ny distributionsstruktur som med facit i hand varit framgångsrik. Försäljningen sjönk under 2018 då samarbetet med Zimmer Biomet avslutades. Därefter har tillväxten varit stark även om pandemin har påverkat Bonesupport och andra medicinteknikbolag negativt med uppskjutna operationer och en allt större vårdskuld.

Bonesupport Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Omsättning 663 Mkr 448 Mkr Tillväxt 480% 32% Bruttomarginal 905% 886% Ebit -165 Mkr -197 Mkr Ebit-marginal -249% -440%

I årets första kvartal landade tillväxten på 48% för hela Bonesupport. Bruttomarginalen stärktes och rörelsemarginalen förbättrades också. Med en bruttomarginal på 90% blir skalbarheten mycket fin när volymerna stiger.

2022 skissar vi på 45% tillväxt. Det är i linje med analytikerkonsensus. Bonesupports tillväxtmål är att öka försäljningen med 40% per år. Åren därpå räknar vi med att Bonesupport kan fortsätta upprätthålla en riktigt stark tillväxt på omkring 40-45% per år. Mycket drivet av godkännandet av Cerament G i USA. Samtidigt finns potential att få godkännande för trauma-indikationen under hösten 2023 om allt går som det ska. Förseningar av godkännanden är inte ovanligt.

Vi räknar också med att marginalen successivt förbättras. 2022 räknar vi med -14% och år 2024 skissar vi på 20% rörelsemarginal. Givet den höga bruttomarginalen och tillräckliga volymer kan Bonesupport nog nå en rörelsemarginal kring 40% på lång sikt. Sedan kommer den redovisade lönsamheten troligen vara lägre beroende på kostnader för studier och ytterligare tillväxtsatsningar.

Använder vi en multipel på 75 gånger omsättningen (cirka 15% rabatt mot peer-gruppen nedan) finns 35% uppsida på sikt. Andra snabbväxande medicinteknikbolag som inte är så lönsamma idag men med stor lönsamhetspotential värderas också till höga multiplar.

Vid utgången av första kvartalet hade Bonesupport en kassa på 195 Mkr. I diagrammet här intill visas hur kassaflödet utvecklats på kvartalsbasis senaste åren. VD Emil Billbäck har tidigare sagt att kassan väntas räcka tills att bolagets uppvisar positivt kassaflöde. Ledningen upprepade detta budskap i samtal med Affärsvärlden. Senaste riktade emissionen genomfördes i maj 2020 (teckningskurs 36 kronor).

Godkännandet av Cerament G för indikationen beninfektion är en väldigt viktig milstolpe för Bonesupport. Cerament G skapar stor nytta för både patienter och för vården med minskade kostnader.

Sedan Affärsvärlden köpstämplade Bonesupport i höstas är aktien upp cirka 45%. Aktien är inte billig sett till multiplar här och nu. Snarare tvärtom. Samtidigt har Bonesupport den stora marginalresan framför sig.

På sikt borde Bonesupport kunna vara ett tänkbart uppköpsobjekt för en större industriell spelare. Efter kursuppgången är en del framgång inprisad i USA. Risken är att godkännandet för indikationen trauma drar ut på tiden.

För investerare som gillar snabbväxande medicinteknikbolag och inte räds de höga multiplarna behåller vi köprådet.",,,,,,,,,,,,
