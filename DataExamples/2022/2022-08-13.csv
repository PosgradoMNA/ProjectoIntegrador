Sebastian Macdonald-Hall who goes by the stage name Sebastian MDH is understood to have moved out of the two-bedroom property in Belgravia weeks ago to allow builders to carry out work.

He is a Millfield-educated real estate consultant and son of property tycoon Caspar Macdonald-Hall whose family fortune is estimated to be £954m in The Sunday Times Rich List.

Fergie 62 is said to have purchased the property from Mr Macdonald-Hall in a private sale after his family obtained a 125-year lease from the Duke of Westminster’s Grosvenor Estate in 2005.

Local residents told The Times on Friday: 'It will be interesting to see who our new neighbours are.

'Sebastian was a lovely guy but we did have to speak to him a few times about the parties he threw that would go on all night.'

Sebastian is also one of four members of an aristocratic DJ group known as Housekeeping founded in 2012.

The property in Belgravia offers a stunning reception room with a cast-iron fireplace large window and two floor to ceiling bookcases

The property's large living room features a neutral decor and horizontal skylight to open up the space. The walls feature panelled mirrors alongside built-in cupboard space

The large open plan kitchen features a black marble island and worktops with a sky light and large windows to ensure maximum light

Other members of the group are Jacobi Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe the brother of Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas Taylor Williams and Carl Waxberg.

Jacobi is understood to have attended the same prep school as Prince William as is friends with Princess Beatrice Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank.

Macdonald Hall meanwhile previously dated Lily Fortescue - sister of Made in Chelsea's Rosie.

The mews near Buckingham Palace is spread over the first and second floors of a former stables and also comes with a roof terrace.

It is also just a ten minute walk from Ghislaine Maxwell's house where Prince Andrew was pictured with his arm around the waist of Virginia Roberts Giuffre MailOnline revealed last week.

The purchase comes despite Fergie previously describing herself as being 'continually on the verge of financial bankruptcy' and having 'little understanding' of money.

One neighbour who lives a few doors away from her new house said last week: 'I suppose the property values will go up with royalty here - unless Andrew moves in of course.'

The bijou terrace is just a third of a mile from Maxwell's former home in central London where she is alleged to have groomed young girls.

The £5million house is said to be viewed as an investment opportunity for her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie - with plans to convert two flats boasting a bijou terrace bar two reception rooms and a parking garage into one home.

Sources say she has no plans to leave the grace and favour 30-room Windsor mansion she shares with disgraced ex-husband Prince Andrew – and instead plans to rent out the new property.

It has been revealed that the Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson purchased the property as an investment for her daughters Princess Beatrice (left) and Princess Eugenie (right)

Sarah Ferguson's Her Heart For A Compass reached the Sunday Times Bestseller list

Her multi-million pound purchase came despite her repeated complaints of difficulties in recent years describing herself as 'continually on the verge of financial bankruptcy' in a 2010 TV interview in the US.

She has also previously admitted to having 'little understanding' of money and there were reports she had run up as much as £4.2m in debt during her marriage to Andrew.

She received £3million from their divorce and most of her income is now likely to come from her books. Her first bodice-ripper crept onto the bestseller charts last year - despite critics branding it a 'slog' with no sex.

Critics branded the book 'boring' but it initially sold 1000 copies a week when it was released.

But her 2021 romance novel 'Her Heart for a Compass' about about an aristocratic redhead may have been the key to her success.

Sources say her financial status improved after she launched a writing career that secured various book deals.

People on the street said the Duchess had been spotted viewing the house in the late spring - and seen running into a waiting vehicle. They admitted they were happy to have yet another famous neighbour - as long as her ex-husband stays away.

A local housekeeper said: ‘About two months ago I saw her coming out of the house. She seemed in a hurry and got into a car'.

A man parking his car in the garage said spaces on the street cost £3000-a-year - but said he believed the Duchess of York had got one.

It comes as Fergie may face a large bill over her role as director at theatre and film investment company Gate Ventures.

Liquidators have reportedly contacted her and other former directors at the firm including Ofcom boss Lord Grade.

The theatre company was placed into administration in March 2020 after a court heard how a Hong Kong tycoon with links to the Royal Family ran up an expense account totalling almost £5million.

Businessman Dr Johnny Hon invoiced the ‘simply extraordinary’ sum of £4.7m to when he acted as chairman.

Gate Ventures has invested in West End shows including Sunset Boulevard and 42nd Street as well as a string of obscure films in the Far East.

A spokeswoman for London & Cambridge Properties the Macdonald-Hall family firm said: 'LCP are a commercial property and investment company and as such would not comment on any private transactions made outside of the business’s remit.'

The luxurious apartment located in a quiet mews near Buckingham Palace and estimated to be worth about £3 million was recently sold by Macdonald-Hall a Millfield-educated real estate consultant known for throwing wild parties.

The attendees of the conference included civil society representatives and political parties and it was conducted by the Constitutional Conduct Group (CCG) Jan Sarokar and People First.

Several speakers elaborated on the ""3M challenges"" and the need for civil society and political parties to come together in order to combat the same effectively. They spoke on issues of unreliability of the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and the misuse of electoral bonds which have introduced big money into the electoral process. Senior journalist Pamela Philipose also brought up the need to regulate fake news propaganda and social media manipulation with regard to politics during the first session.

Eleven parties also endorsed resolutions to combat Machine Money & Media Power which they say are ""distorting electoral democracy in India"". The joint civil society and political parties conference was attended by over 200 people. Representatives of political parties including INC CPIM SP BSP CPI NCP TRS RJD RLD Welfare Party & Swaraj India resolved to ""fight against machine money and media power which pose the gravest challenges to democracy in India today.""

In the first session the chair Deb Mukherji spoke of the current scenario and the ""need for civil society and political parties to come together during these unprecedented times"". MG Devasahayam spoke on the effort of the Citizens Commission on Elections which reviewed the 3M challenges to democracy as analysed by experts in India and across the world and published them as a book titled- 'Electoral Democracy? An Inquiry into the fairness and integrity of Elections in India'.

Professor of Computer Science IIT Delhi Dr. Subhashis Banerji explained how EVMs can be manipulated and said there is an urgent need to ensure verifiability and auditability of the voting process. Co-convenor of the National Campaign for Peoples' Right to Information Anjali Bhardwaj spoke of how the electoral bonds had opened the floodgates to unlimited anonymous big money with no information being provided to people on who is funding the parties. senior journalist Pamela Philipose spoke of the urgent need to regulate fake news propaganda and social media manipulation which was weaponised by BJP in elections.

In the second session leaders of 11 political parties spoke on the challenges posed by 3Ms. The resolutions passed at the Constitutional Conduct Group (CCG) Jan Sarokar and People First Joint Civil Society--Political Parties Conference held at New Delhi on August 13 are:

EVM voting and VVPAT counting

It is recognised that purely EVM-based voting and counting does not comply with 'Democracy Principles' which require that each voter should be able to verify that his or her vote is cast-as-intended; recorded-as-cast and counted-as-recorded. We demand the following:

i. EVMs cannot be assumed to be tamper-proof. The voting process should be redesigned to be software and hardware independent in order to be verifiable or auditable.

ii. The VVPAT system should be re-designed to be fully voter-verified. A voter should be able to get the VVPAT slip and cast it in a chip-free ballot box for the vote to be valid and counted. This should not require interaction with any authorities and should not depend in any way on assumptions of correctness of machines.

iii. The integrity of the VVPAT slips and the EVM machines during the entire time after polling and before counting and auditing must be ensured in a manner that is verifiable. The VVPAT slips must be printed in such form and manner to be preserved for a minimum of 5 years.

iv. There must be stringent audit of the electronic tally for every constituency before the results are declared. The audit should be based on full manual counting of the VVPAT slips to improve voter confidence. Forms 17A and Forms 17C must be tallied and be publicly disclosed at the end of polling on the day itself. Forms 17A and 17C should also be tallied with the manual count of VVPAT printouts.

v. There is need to move away from certification of voting equipment and processes and demonstrate that the outcome of an election is correct irrespective of machines and trust on custody chains of EVMs and VVPATs. This can be done by adopting well established strategies for risk-limiting audits (RLA) or by using a provably end-to-end verifiable cryptographic protocol or both. The ECI should explore the possibilities.

vi. The EVM voting and counting system design should be subjected to independent (of the government and ECI) review and the integrity of the election process should be subjected to independent audit. The findings should be made public and all design details should be transparent and publicly available.

Money Power

Massive money power and the criminal muscle-power created thereof is destroying the very integrity of India's elections. Candidates expenses have a ceiling but political party spending does not have any ceiling.The Fast-rising economic oligarchy in the country threatening India as a welfare state is the direct fallout of this extreme criminal and money power in elections which is the fountainhead of all corruption in the country.

It compromises the integrity of democracy in multiple ways: it raises the entry barriers to politics; excludes honest candidates and parties; leads to corruption and big money controlling the state; distortion of policy making in wasteful inefficient and anti-democratic directions; and exacerbation of polarisation.

The government using the Money Bill route to bypass Rajya Sabha introduced electoral bonds that has increased opaqueness and consolidated the role of big money in electoral politics. The Electoral Bonds Scheme in its current form must be immediately discontinued. There must be transparency in political party funding. Details of donations including amounts and names of donors should be in the public domain.

Media Power

The free media plays a crucial role before during and after elections in creating an environment for the dissemination of information that enhances people's ability to vote in an informed way. India's mediascape has undergone a major transformation with the exponential growth in the use of the internet across the world and also in India.

Unfortunately communication technologies and media platforms are creating polarisation through the circulation of disinformation and hate- filled text posts and tweets. Despite guidelines and codes ECI has not seem to be taking cognizance of the many violations in the past elections. ECI failed to curb fake news online before and during these elections. Procrastination silence and inaction characterised ECI's responses even to serious violations of Model Code of Conduct and media code. We urge the ECI to take strong and effective actions against the offenders whosoever they may be.

The resolutions were unanimously passed and supported by senior political leaders such as

Digvijay Singh of the INC. Singh said he ""did not trust EVMs as people couldn't be sure where their vote went. Due to electoral bonds people did not know where money was going and by unchecked use of money Bharatiya Janata Party was controlling the media and in fact even funding the spread of fake news."" He added that ""in many states the BJP was using money power and various agencies including ED CBI IT to break legislators and make governments fall and install their own.""

According to Sitaram Yechury of CPIM ""electoral bonds were smuggled in through the Money Bill route"". He had challenged it in court but said that """"the Supreme Court had not decided the matter even though more than three years had passed. Yechury said the time has come for all political parties to come together and ""start a Jan Andolan to save democracy."" He added that the Election Commision was functioning like ""it's become like the Executive Council rather than an independent Constitutional body"" and that ""the media was acting as a propaganda channel for the government suppressing the voice of the Opposition.""

D Raja of the CPI said ""the fact that 90% of the bonds were transacted in the highest denomination of Rs. 1 crore showed that this was not being given by ordinary persons showed the control of the electoral funding was completely under corporate control."" According to D Raja he had also approached the Supreme Court seeking full VVPAT count of EVMs.

According to RLD's Dr. Mairajuddin Ahmed ""role of big money and criminalisation has completely skewed the electoral field"". Jitendra Awad of NCP added that ""everyone knows knows EVMs can be manipulated - but where will you go for justice? The Supreme Court the institutions are all compromised. Therefore we have to go to the court of the people.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5kYXl3b3JsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9pcmlzaC1uZXdzL3NhbG1hbi1ydXNoZGllLXdhcy1wcm90ZWN0ZWQtYnktaXJhLW9uLXZpc2l0cy10by1pcmVsYW5kLXVuZGVyLWhpcy1kZWFkbHktM20tZmF0d2EvMTEzODc0Njc3Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salman Rushdie was protected by IRA on visits to Ireland under his deadly £3m fatwa,"The Satanic Verses writer said he had “free pass” from terror group as they respected his opposition to the censoring of Sinn Féin

Salman Rushdie was told he was in no danger from the IRA

Salman Rushdie was protected by the IRA on visits to Ireland under his deadly £3million fatwa.

The Satanic Verses writer – now fighting for life after being repeatedly stabbed in a cowardly knife attack – said he had a “free pass” from the terror group as they respected his opposition to the censoring of Sinn Féin.

Salman (75) said about making a “political trip to Dublin” with third wife Elizabeth West in the 1990s to meet President Mary Robinson.

During the trip he was approached by the IRA after he later gave a talk at the Let In The Light free-speech conference at Trinity College.

Salman revealed: “Afterwards at the drinks for the speakers a small sturdy woman came up and said because I had opposed the ordinance called Section 31 which banned Sinn Féin from Irish TV ‘You have removed all danger to yourself from us’.”

When Salman asked “And who’s us?” he says the woman stared in his eyes and said: “You know fockin’ well who we are.”

Salman added: “After being given this free pass by the IRA I was whisked to Gay Byrne’s Late Late Show and because Gay had said he had read and liked The Satanic Verses just about the whole of Ireland decided that it and its author must be ok.”

Four-times married dad-of-two Salman is suffering from severed nerves a butchered liver and faces losing an eye after he was knifed on stage while sitting with his back to an attacker before a lecture on Friday.

The man accused of brutally attacking Salman was yesterday charged with attempted murder.

New York state police had named the suspected knifeman as Hadi Matar (24) of Fairview New Jersey shortly after the writer was attacked.

The Satanic Verses has been banned in Iran since 1988 as many Muslims consider it to be blasphemous.

Iran’s late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa or edict calling for Rushdie’s death with a bounty of more than €3m placed on his head.

Rushdie was a guest in Bono’s home

Rushdie also recounted his long-standing friendship with Bono saying usually stayed at “a beautiful little guest house” at the bottom of his garden in Killiney.

He loved its “CinemaScope views” adding: “Guests were encouraged to sign their names and scribble messages or drawings on the bathroom wall.”

Salman recounts how two days after the IRA told him they were fans Bono smuggled him to a bar in Killiney without telling the Garda protection squad – leaving the security furious.It has been reported Bono sheltered the hunted author at his house for five years in secret.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlndWFyZGlhbi5jb20ucGgvcmVwLWJpcm9uLXNlY3VyZXMtcDE2OC0zbS1mb3ItcmVwYWlycy1vZi1kYW1hZ2VkLWJyaWRnZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rep. Biron secures P168.3M for repairs of damaged bridges,"By Francis Allan L. Angelo

The Department of Public Works and Highways headed by Sec. Manuel Bonoan has approved the P168.3-million funding for the repair of three key bridges in the 4th district of Iloilo that were damaged at the height of Typhoon Agaton in April 2022.

The office of 4th district Rep. Ferjenel G. Biron who facilitated the funding confirmed the information through a sub-allotment advice that DPWH released on Aug 10 2022.

DPWH authorized its office in Region 6 through the 2nd District Engineering Office in Dumangas Iloilo to spend the funds for the repair and rehabilitation of the Monfort Bridge in Dingle town and Agtambo and Alimono Bridges in Passi City.

The funding was drawn from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management fund in Republic Act 11639 or the 2022 General Appropriations Act.

Based on the Special Allotment Release Order from the Department of Budget and Management the funds will be spent on the following damaged bridges:

-rehabilitation of the 5 spans of pre-stressed concrete girders of Monfort Bridge particularly the reconstruction of spans 1 to 2 and retrofitting of the remaining 3 spans (P60 million);

-construction of the 60-meter pre-stressed concrete girder of Alimono bridge including approaches (P60 million); and

– construction of the 50-meter pre-stressed concrete girder of Agtambo bridge including approaches (P50 million)

Right after typhoon Agaton struck in April Rep. Biron and his son then congressman now Dumangas Mayor Braeden John Biron pledged to hasten the release of funds from the national government to repair the three bridges and other road infrastructures.

The Birons initially facilitated the release of funds from the Immediate Response Fund and/or the Quick Response Fund of the DPWH for the initial repairs of the damaged infrastructures.

Rep. Biron said the immediate repairs will minimize the economic impact brought about by these damaged infrastructures.

At that time the DPWH 2nd District Engineering Office under Engr. Sanny Boy O. Oropel estimated that more than P300 million were needed to rehabilitate and repair the damaged infrastructures.

Apart from the three bridges the other damaged infrastructures included portions of the Passi-San Rafael-Lemery-Sara Road Iloilo-Capiz Road in Dueñas and Passi City Passi-Calinog Road in Gines Viejo Passi City; Barotac Nuevo-Polot-An-Bangga Banate Road in Barotac Nuevo Balabag-Maquina-Cayos-Patlad Road in Dumangas Iloilo-East Coast Capiz Road in Dumangas Passi-San Enrique-Garrita Road in San Enrique Pototan-Tabugon Road in Dingle among others."

Greg Abbott traveled to Uvalde amid growing criticism of his level of engagement with a community still reeling from the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School.

The Republican governor met with families of the 21 victims on Friday his office confirmed to ABC News. Arriving Friday morning at the town's municipal airport Abbott said ""I'm here to help out the folks of Uvalde.""

But some have accused Abbott who is currently in the throes of a heated reelection bid of ulterior motives in quietly engaging with family members of the victims. State Sen. Roland Gutierrez a Democrat from San Antonio suggested that the governor's visit might have been a political calculation -- particularly given his hesitancy to heed their calls for gun reform.

""It is campaign season so now Governor Abbott is checking a box to say he met with families"" Gutierrez told ABC News. ""He needs to do something real for them.""

Javier Cazares whose daughter Jackie Cazares was killed in the Robb shooting was among those who met with Abbott on Friday. Cazares said he and others took the opportunity to ask questions about school safety and again propose raising the age limit to purchase assault rifles. Cazares said the governor took notes but did not answer their questions directly.

""We just wanted to have a chance to ask him some questions"" Cazares told ABC News.

Renae Eze a spokesperson for Abbott confirmed Abbott's travel to Uvalde in a statement to ABC News and said the governor has ""[visited] with every family who requested a meeting.""

""Governor Abbott visited Uvalde today and over the past several weeks meeting with over 30 victims' families privately to ensure they are receiving all the resources and support needed to heal"" Eze said.

Abbott has attracted the ire of some in Uvalde who perceive his posture toward the community as aloof and distant. Some family members were disappointed when Abbott did not attend any funeral services for the victims. Others cited news reports indicating that Abbott attended a political fundraiser on the night of the shooting.

Beto O’Rourke the Democratic nominee for governor has visited Uvalde five times since May 24 and has also criticized Abbott for his response to the shooting.

Eze the Abbott spokesperson said ""many families requested private funerals and the Governor and First Lady instead sent flowers and condolences to let the loved ones know they remain in their prayers.""

In July Angel Garza father of victim Amerie Jo Garza told ABC News: ""Governor Abbott has yet to reach out."" And Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin said in mid-July that he had not been in touch with Abbott in the prior four weeks.

Eze pushed back on complaints that Abbott has not sufficiently engaged with the community.

""The Governor has been to the community every month since the tragedy"" Eze said. ""Governor Abbott and his office remain in regular contact with local leaders to ensure all immediate needs for victims' families and the Uvalde community are being met..",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9iZXRvLW9yb3Vya2VzLWNoYW5jZXMtYmVhdGluZy1hYmJvdHQtdW5kZXItMy1tb250aHMtZWxlY3Rpb24tMTczMzUwN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beto O'Rourke's Chances of Beating Abbott With Under 3 Months to Election,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/beto-orourkes-chances-beating-abbott-under-3-months-election-1733507 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9iZXRvLW9yb3Vya2VzLWNoYW5jZXMtYmVhdGluZy1hYmJvdHQtdW5kZXItMy1tb250aHMtZWxlY3Rpb24tMTczMzUwN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvYmxhY2stcmVlbC10di1hd2FyZHMtd2lubmVycy1saXN0LTEyMzUwOTE4OTUv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC9ibGFjay1yZWVsLXR2LWF3YXJkcy13aW5uZXJzLWxpc3QtMTIzNTA5MTg5NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Reel TV Awards: Quinta Brunson & ‘Abbott Elementary’ Lead Winners List,"Summer has ended and school is in session as Quinta Brunson and Abbott Elementary taught a masterclass at the 6th Annual Black Reel TV Awards presented by idobi.

Awards Daily chats with Abbott Elementary‘s Sheryl Lee Ralph about how the first character she ever played is connected to Barbara Howard and why she thinks Abbott could be the next Grey’s Anatomy.

On ABC’s Abbott Elementary Barbara Howard (Sheryl Lee Ralph) watches newbie Janine (Quinta Brunson) as she find her way as a teacher early in her career. Which begs the question: What was Barbara like when she was a new teacher? Ralph says that she likes to connect this character with one from her past.

“It’s so interesting” says Ralph. “People always look at my very first film A Piece of the Action. I play a raw young little hood rat girl who was very smart but just needed a teacher who understood her and her name was Barbara Hanley. So people always put together the power of that performance with the performance they see now in Barbara Howard and say ‘This is why Barbara Howard is a great teacher.’ It always makes me feel so good that people actually take the time to do their own personal research and put puzzles together. That’s what I think it is.”

Barbara Howard is so put-together and collected in how she handles herself that even when she messes up like when she accidentally marks all of her kindergarteners reading at a fourth-grade level in the episode “New Tech” she never looks to the camera in fear like so many of the other teacher characters do when they’re in trouble.

“In my mind I did not look at the camera those first 13 episodes because I believed [the cameras] do not belong there. They should not be in the school” says Ralph getting into character. “They should not be recording this. The fact that they are taking advantage of an underprivileged school system and children who don’t have as much as others I don’t believe they belong there. Well. . .” says Ralph with a sly smile “we’ll see what happens with the next 22 episodes.”

Unlike her character who is resistant to technology Ralph enjoys it.

“I’m Ava. I’m trying to convince my phone I’m 22 years old. Yes thank you. I love the future and the fact that I’m in it. But that doesn’t mean I’m good at using it. Very often they’ll send me things and I don’t post them because I can’t figure out how to do it! But I love it. I can’t believe that all I have to do is pick up my phone and say ‘Siri Google directions home.’ That’s the best! ‘Hey Siri Google my net worth.’ I love it!”

She also loves the intergenerational dynamic between Janine and Barbara. After Janine offers to help Barbara learn how to use the new school technology Barbara’s eyes swell with tears as she says “I’d like that.”

“I love the fact that Barbara is so open to learning that she remains a lifelong learner. That was always important to my father and it’s become important to me. And I love the fact the character is open to learning. So it’s like if you can help me please help me.”

In the season finale Barbara wonders if it’s time for her to retire (thankfully she doesn’t!). Ralph believes it’s the young teachers like Janine that keep her around.

“There’s a moment after all of those 13 episodes Barbara has been commenting on poor Janine’s wardrobe choices and at one point she turns to her friend and says ‘I remember when that was me when those were my clothes’ and it’s like ‘God I love it so much.’ She dresses so weird. It’s so endearing and I really think that Barbara gets a second chance a third chance a fourth chance with seeing these new teachers come into the school system and they’re so deeply needed. It looks like she’s not helping them because she’s so hard on them but she’s with them because she wants them to succeed. I think Barbara deeply wants to know that when she retires they’ll be others to carry on just as well as she did.”

But Ralph herself has no intention to retire just yet—even if she believes it could be with this show.

“I knew [Abbott Elementary] was something special! Tyler Williams and I looked at each other and I said ‘You feel it don’t you? You feel it. Because we’ve been down this road several times. And this show right here? We’ve got something special.’ I would be shocked if this show did not retire everyone on the show. I would be shocked if the next 10 years were not spent successfully and happily doing Abbott Elementary. Look at it this way: If Grey’s Anatomy can be going on for 15 years trust me Janine has got a story to tell for 20!”

Editor’s note: This story contains explicit language.

A little over a year ago Nancy Thompson an Austin mother of three kids stood alone for two and half hours in front of the Texas Capitol with a sign that said “Mothers Against Greg Abbott.”

She was most upset about the governor’s ban on mask mandates worried about her son who was medically vulnerable to COVID-19 after being hospitalized for another virus that had “infected all his organs” she said.

“Honestly I just didn’t give a shit anymore” Thompson said. “I was just done. I was so done.”

Now her protests are not so lonely. Her “Mothers Against Greg Abbott” effort has grown into a potent political force in the governor’s race with a membership of over 50000 on Facebook. The group has recently caught more attention after releasing professionally made ads that have gone viral on social media.

They have earned the backing of Abbott’s Democratic opponent Beto O’Rourke who told the group Monday their work is “the talk of the town” no matter where he is.

“It’s absolutely transforming what’s possible in Texas right now and there’s literally not a day that goes by that Amy or I or someone on our team do not get asked ‘Have you seen that great Mothers Against Greg Abbott ad?’” O’Rourke said addressing the group virtually along with his wife Amy.

O’Rourke has long had an advantage with women in his uphill battle against Abbott leading the governor by 6 percentage points among likely female voters in the latest public survey. But Thompson is working to rally a more specific group: mothers like herself a onetime Republican who did not get deeply involved in politics until recent years. The group has naturally drawn many Democrats but Thompson wants it to be as inclusive as possible and its website calls it “a mix of Democrats Moderate Republicans and Independents who are ready to work together for change for Texas.”

“We’re just trying to organize the army and make it super accessible to everyday Texans like me who may not be super involved in politics — until you’re super involved in politics” Thompson said.

Now Thompson is trying to take the group to the next level for the final three months of the race organizing chapters throughout the state and endeavoring to put ads on TV. On Monday it announced it had put up five billboards across the state criticizing Abbott over his response to the Uvalde school shooting.

Abbott’s campaign declined to comment on the group.

Campaign finance records show the group raised $170000 through June 30 garnering over 2400 mostly small donations. Thompson said the group has raised at least $200000 more since then as its ads blew up online in July. That is a notable amount for such an upstart group though it still pales in comparison to the eight-figure campaign accounts that both Abbott and O’Rourke have to spread their messages.

While the group has been in existence since last year it has garnered the most attention yet for the ads it has released this summer. One of them titled “Whose Choice” depicts a fictitious scence in which a doctor is counseling a woman about a pregnancy she may need to terminate due to a “catastrophic brain abnormality.” The doctor tells her there is “only one person who can make this choice” — before abruptly picking up a phone and calling Abbott. The ad has gotten over 7 million views on Twitter since it was posted July 25.

O’Rourke called the ads “amazingly effective” Monday.

Thompson is a mother of three from Austin whose professional career has mostly been in marketing. She said she considered herself a Republican — serving as a delegate to the 1988 national convention for example — until President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. She began to vote Democratic going forward but did not get more actively involved in politics until more recently.

It was not until after Thompson made her initial protest sign last year that she realized it had carried the same acronym as former President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan: Make America Great Again. But she laughed it off to herself and stuck with it.

Someone took a picture of Thompson’s protest that day and it started spreading on social media. Noticing how many people seemed to relate Thompson created a private Facebook group a few days later using the same name and by December it had over 20000 members.

Thompson noticed membership spiked around major news events involving Abbott like when the state’s six-week abortion ban went into effect in September. Another jump in membership came in February when Abbott ordered state agencies to investigate gender-affirming care for transgender kids as child abuse.

“It just seemed like every single time Greg Abbott opened up his mouth we gained thousands of followers every single time” Thompson said. “He just spent the last year making enemies of so many Texans.”

The next year as the group continued to swell and Thompson was looking for volunteers she met the filmmaker Michelle Mower. Mower offered to help — and to connect Thompson with fellow filmmakers — and before long they were all holding weekly meetings.

The group’s first ad “Breaking Bread” came out April 15 and it depicted three pairs of women who had been driven apart by politics agreeing to reconcile and hash out their differences. Everyone donated their time for the ad which cost only $600 covering meals and equipment rentals Thompson said. It would largely remain that way going forward.

Thompson continued to work with Mower and Chelsea Aldrich an actress and writer. But she also realized she had a valuable resource next door — literally — in her neighbors David Wolfson and Lauren Sheppard co-founders of Spoon Films. The company had worked for a political action committee in 2018 that opposed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz when O’Rourke was challenging him — Fuck Ted Cruz PAC — and had leftover footage they were willing to share. Spoon Films ultimately produced ads for Mothers Against Greg Abbott featuring Cecile Richards O’Rourke’s national finance chair and the daughter of former Gov. Ann Richards.

Along the way Thompson also met fellow likeminded mothers like Cheryl Richard a retired oil and gas executive from Austin. Richard said she first started talking to Thompson last year when Richard was thinking about challenging Abbott herself.

Richard ultimately provided $3000 in seed funding to help make an ad called “Nothing Changes” in which several mothers speak to the camera about overcoming political apathy in Texas. Richard also lent her horse Ivan who has a cameo in the ad.

Richard 66 has twin sons and five grandchildren with another on the way. Four of her grandchildren are girls. She said she identified as Republican her whole life until “around 2016” when Trump was elected president and she realized how much the GOP had drifted away from her on some issues. She supports abortion rights and “reasonable” gun control she said like raising the age to buy an assault rifle to 21.

“I don’t feel like I left the Republican Party as much as it left me” Richard said. “I’ve always been a moderate. I’m still a moderate. … And I think there are a lot of moderates out there particularly women who feel left behind and for the same reasons I felt left behind.”

Richard acknowledged that beating Abbott is “not just about putting out ads.” The “much tougher” mission she said is turning out more voters.

After all the ads produced by the anti-Cruz PAC garnered plenty of clicks and media coverage but O’Rourke still lost to Cruz by 3 percentage points.

Thompson appears aware of the challenge. She is working to expand the group’s advertising filming more ads for the web hoping to eventually air them on TV and putting up the billboards which spotlight Abbott’s statement after theUvalde shooting that it “could’ve been worse.” But she is also helping establish MAGA chapters across the state including places as far-flung as Alpine in far West Texas and Palestine in East Texas.

The group has grown so much that she recently had to bring on two part-time employees an accountant and a fundraiser.

While O’Rourke addressed the group for the first time Monday Thompson has made sure to operate it independently of his campaign mindful of campaign finance regulations. In fact Thompson said it was not until the last week of July that O’Rourke started following her on Twitter.

AMD,Advanced Micro Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzE0LzMtY29tcGFuaWVzLXRoYXQtY291bGQtYmUtd29ydGgtMS10cmlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDMyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Companies That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion by 2032,"Buying these stocks today could be a rewarding move in 10 years.

At the time of writing Apple Microsoft Alphabet and Amazon are the only four U.S. companies with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or greater. Tesla is not far behind with a market cap of $907 million.

These are elite businesses that have earned shareholders tremendous gains. It goes without saying that these companies all had much smaller market caps not too long ago. Amazon's market cap was $105 billion exactly 10 years ago.

Generally a good place to look for the next home-run stocks are growing companies with a market cap between $100 billion to $500 billion. But in this case let's first look at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) which has a higher market cap but could be a timely buy right now.

For higher return prospects you'll want to consider Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.31%) and Salesforce (CRM 0.55%). These are solid growth stories that still have years to play out.

1. Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway is one of the safest stocks you can hold for the long term. After rising 50% over the last five years it carries a market cap of $653 billion. That puts it within shooting distance of the $1 trillion milestone. There are a few reasons Berkshire will keep growing in value.

Berkshire has a sterling balance sheet with $122 billion of cash and fixed securities. The company has a large stock portfolio worth $327 billion at the end of the second quarter. Buffett's investment vehicle holds large stakes in Apple Bank of America and Coca-Cola among other stocks. Buffett has most recently been adding to large stakes in Chevron Occidental Petroleum and leading PC brand HP (formerly Hewlett-Packard).

Another piece of Berkshire's intrinsic value is its dozens of privately held businesses. The company's subsidiaries span everything from candy to railroads. It also owns several insurance companies that provide $147 billion in float or money that Berkshire collects from insurance premiums that it can reinvest in stocks bonds or acquisitions. Many of these Berkshire-held businesses tend to be immune from the changes in technology which adds a degree of predictability to their long-term performance -- something Buffett no doubt considered.

One of Buffett's best stock ideas lately has been Berkshire Hathaway itself. Through the first half of 2022 he bought $4 billion worth of the company's shares -- a sign that Buffett sees the stock as undervalued. The stock's price has tripled over the last decade and could repeat that return which would push Berkshire's market cap over $1 trillion by 2032.

2. Advanced Micro Devices

Owning companies that serve megatrends in technology such as spending on data centers cloud computing and other advanced computing needs could pay off big. Advanced Micro Devices has emerged as a key supplier of high-performance chips in these markets.

AMD currently sports a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23 based on 2022 earnings estimates and has a market cap of $159 billion. To reach $1 trillion in 10 years the share price needs to climb at a compound annual rate of 20%. That is achievable for this fast-growing chipmaker.

For a long time AMD was the underdog in the semiconductor industry. It's always played the role of a low-cost alternative to leaders like Intel and Nvidia but not anymore.

While AMD is still way behind Intel in central processing units (CPUs) and Nvidia in graphics processing units (GPUs) it is winning over customers with its renewed focus on designing high-performance chips. Data center operators are now looking at AMD's Epyc server chips as a viable alternative to Intel. In the last quarter AMD again gained market share over its CPU rival. Revenue grew 70% year over year in the second quarter driven by strong growth in data center chips and consumer chips for notebooks and gaming.

The data center accelerator market which includes spending on CPUs and GPUs is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 34% through 2027 reaching $75 billion. AMD just completed the acquisition of Xilinx a leading supplier of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips which fills out its product lineup to tackle this enormous opportunity. The strong tailwind in the data center market along with AMD's modest valuation could deliver market-beating returns to investors over the long term.

There is a reason why AMD CEO Lisa Su is considered one of the top business leaders right now. Su has done a marvelous job guiding this underdog to industry leadership and its best days are still ahead.

3. Salesforce

The name Salesforce doesn't sound like a growth tech stock that is worthy of the elite club of $1 trillion companies but every investor should know about this amazing business.

Former Oracle executive Marc Benioff co-founded Salesforce in 1999 and currently serves as the company's chairman and co-CEO. Salesforce pioneered the software-as-a-service business model. Companies save money by subscribing to Salesforce's cloud-based software which lowers in-house expenses by maintaining installing and keeping systems updated.

Salesforce has grown tremendously and has been ranked the No. 1 customer relationship management (CRM) software provider for nine years. Its flagship product is the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Customer 360 platform which offers a suite of software that helps companies manage sales marketing and e-commerce and it continues to expand into new categories.

It has reinvested its growing profitability into strategic acquisitions that expand its offering and competitive lead in the market. Last year it acquired Slack Technologies which offers a communication platform for employees for $27 billion.

What's most remarkable about Salesforce is its consistency which speaks volumes about the size of its long-term growth opportunity. After two decades of high revenue growth Salesforce is still growing quarterly revenue over 20% year over year.

It generated $27 billion in revenue over the last four quarters but the total addressable market for the company's services is expected to reach $284 billion by 2026 according to Gartner Research. It can grow for a long time. However if Salesforce continues its record of strategic acquisitions its addressable market could widen even more as it expands its product offering.

With a market cap of $189 billion Salesforce is well on its way toward $1 trillion. It has the industry leadership and massive market opportunity to deliver market-beating returns to investors.

No. But the end result was just what she needed to cap off her career.

Nunes (11-7 MMA 5-4 UFC) snapped a two-fight skid Saturday when she eked out a split decision against Cynthia Calvillo (9-5-1 MMA 6-5-1 UFC) on Saturday. The women’s flyweight bout was part of the UFC on ESPN 41 preliminary card at Pechanga Arena.

The fight lacked action for all 15 minutes incurring boos from fans on a few occasions. Rounds 1 and 2 seemingly were close but the third clearly belonged to Nunes who landed her best punch – a hard right hook –in the final frame.

Once the horn sounded Nunes took off her gloves and left them in the center of the octagon before the judges’ scorecards of 28-29 29-28 and 30-27 had been read in her favor. Nunes 36 said earlier in fight week that she still had a championship mentality but it was clear announcing her retirement was a decision she’d made prior to stepping in the cage.

“I am (retiring)” Nunes told Daniel Cormier during her post-fight octagon interview. “As a fighter I think I’ve done what I wanted to. It started as a hobby. I got all the way here. I’m going to focus on coaching and bringing up those girls that are struggling right now.”

She added “I want more babies. So I’m stepping away to have another kid.”

Nina Nunes and UFC double champion Amanda Nunes who are married are parents to daughter Raegan Nunes who turns 2 in September. Nina gave birth to Raegan back in 2020.

Susquehanna Financial Group’s data shows that lead times or the time it takes between placing an order and receiving a chip averaged 26.9 weeks in July compared to a revised 27 weeks in June. Lead times decreased for the third month in a row.

Even while the general indication improved the study found that there was still a shortage of power management components and microcontrollers notably those utilised by automakers and producers of industrial equipment. For example lead times for power management chips went from 31.3 weeks to 32 weeks in July. Some products’ prices continue to rise.

“In terms of the broader industry we still wait for inventory and over-ordering issues to subside” Susquehanna analyst Chris Rolland said Thursday in a research note.

According to Rolland’s research industry-wide shortages have not yet been resolved despite a reduction in demand in several sectors particularly for parts used in cellphones and personal computers. According to his writing overall lead times are still more than twice as long as they would be in a “healthy” market.

A sharp decline in demand from manufacturers of personal computers has been reported by Nvidia Corp. Intel Corp. and others. According to Micron Technology Inc. owners of the enormous data centres that serve as the foundation of the internet and business networks are starting to purchase components at a slower rate.

Desktop processor shipments which highlight computer reductions fell to their lowest level in almost three decades in the second quarter according to Mercury Research. According to researcher Dean McCarron total processor shipments recorded their biggest year-over-year decline since around 1984.

disproportionately hard on Intel. In contrast rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. had growth across the board. In a report published on Thursday McCarron stated that AMD “gained share in the second quarter and established a new record high at 31.4%.” AMD grew its sales and expanded its market share for a 13th straight quarter he said despite a decline in the general market for pricey server processors. Investors have already concluded that the chip sector has entered one of its cyclical downturns. This year the Philadelphia Stock Market Semiconductor Index has decreased by 24%.

Antioxidants are widely used in consumer products and some are associated with toxic effects.

How am I exposed to antioxidants?

Individuals can be exposed to antioxidants through skin exposure inhalation or ingestion. Antioxidants are added to a variety of consumer products such as food packaging and personal care products since they have stabilizing properties that help preserve packaging materials.1 While antioxidants can be found in consumer products they are not chemically bonded to the materials they are added to leading to their migration into the environment.2 In addition to consumer products antioxidants have been detected in environmental samples such as air particles e-waste dust residential dust and sediment.2

Common sources of antioxidants include:

Personal care products: antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) can be used in lip products hair products sunscreen fragrances and deodorant as a preservative. 3

Plastic materials: BHT and Irganox are both types of antioxidants that are added to plastics like polyethylene and polypropylene. Antioxidants in plastics have been found to migrate into oil and food that the plastic comes into contact with. 4 Food packaging: BHT can be added to the plastic or wax lining of food packaging and has been found to migrate into food. 45

Food: while many foods contain natural antioxidants which can provide health benefits synthetic antioxidants such as BHA and BHT are often added to foods to preserve fats and oils.6

Why should I be concerned?

With antioxidants being detected from residential dust to food packaging there are multiple routes that expose humans to antioxidants. While research on their toxic effects has been limited studies have raised concerns. In laboratory studies butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) caused liver cell damage.7 Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) caused cancer in laboratory animals and is considered a possible carcinogen.8 In another laboratory study diphenylamine was discovered to increase liver spleen and kidney weights as well as increase rates of anemia in rats.9

Antioxidants can also turn into other harmful chemicals. When BHT comes in contact with oxygen it can turn into a chemical called BHT-Q. BHT-Q is associated with vision disturbances in humans and neurotoxic effects in animals. Like BHT BHT-Q has also been detected in air dust and sediment samples sometimes at higher levels than BHT itself. 21011

How can I reduce my exposure?

We can reduce exposures for everyone by winning policies and market actions to reduce plastic and replace harmful antioxidants with safer substitutes. You can let your favorite retailers brands as well as policymakers know that you want them to ban harmful antioxidants and make sure substitutes are safer.

Avoid plastics. And avoid products that list antioxidants as ingredients (such as butylated hydroxytoluene and diphenyl amine).

Eating fewer processed foods may also reduce exposure to antioxidants used in such foods.

What’s the solution?

It is impossible for us to shop our way out of this problem. And we shouldn’t have to. When you walk into a store you should be able to trust that the products on store shelves are safe.

Companies shouldn’t sell products with dangerous chemicals—especially as scientists continue to learn more about the “silent epidemic” caused by the cumulative impact of all the toxic chemicals we are regularly exposed to. And our state and federal governments shouldn’t allow chemicals on the market until they’re proven safe.

The only way to protect everyone from toxic chemicals like antioxidants is to change policies at government and corporate levels to make sure that safer solutions are the norm.

In the study published Aug. 2 in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Science & Technology researchers point to the dangers of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS.

PFAS are a family of human-made chemicals used in countless products today from food packaging to waterproof clothing. They can spread in the atmosphere and are now found in every corner of our Earth – including rainwater snow and even human blood. PFAS are dubbed ""forever chemicals"" because they can last ""thousands of years"" Clean Water Action notes.

A host of possible serious health consequences has been associated with PFAS including cancer infertility and pregnancy complications immune system problems and increased cholesterol according to researchers at Stockholm University and ETH Zurich.

According to the EPA most uses of PFOA and PFOS were ""voluntarily phased out by U.S. manufacturers"" but some products still use them.

In the Aug. 2 study the team of environmental scientists noted that worldwide guidelines for levels of PFAS in drinking water have ""progressively decreased over the last 22 years"" notably because of new research and awareness about the toxicity of PFAS.

PFAS nationwide:EPA finds no safe level for two toxic 'forever chemicals' found in many U.S. water systems

Plastic pollution:Microplastics have been found in air water food and now ... human blood

The declines underline growing concern about the chemicals and what amount is safe to drink. For example the researchers found that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency health advisory for allowable levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) one PFAS variant associated with cancer risks had declined by a factor of 37.5 million over the years – most recently from 70 parts per trillion (ppt) to 0.004 parts per trillion.

The researchers found the levels of PFOA in drinking water in every part of the world even some of the most remote areas exceeded the EPA's contamination guidelines.

That means ""rainwater everywhere would be judged unsafe to drink"" Ian Cousins lead author of the study and environmental science professor at Stockholm University said in a university press release. ""Although in the industrial world we don’t often drink rainwater many people around the world expect it to be safe to drink and it supplies many of our drinking water sources.”

Toxicity of water:Across the US towns warn of toxic PFAS chemicals in drinking water. Here's what to know.

The study also found that levels of other PFAS variants such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) also exceeded U.S. guidelines in numerous rural and urban regions around the globe.

“The extreme persistence and continual global cycling of certain PFAS will lead to the continued exceedance of the above-mentioned guidelines” Martin Scheringer a co-author of the study and a professor based at ETH Zurich in Switzerland and Masaryk University in the Czech Republic said in the news release.

The researchers concluded that the safe ""planetary boundary"" for PFAS has been exceeded carrying immense consequences for environmental and human health.

The study underlined that action to prevent further damage was urgent – such as ""large investment in advanced cleanup technology"" and ""rapidly restricting uses of PFAS wherever possible.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9saW5kZW4vc2VjdGlvbnMvaGVhbHRoLWFuZC13ZWxsbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlcy9oaWdoLWxldmVscy1vZi1jYW5jZXItY2F1c2luZy1jaGVtaWNhbHMtZm91bmQtaW4tbGluZGVu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High Levels of Cancer-causing Chemicals Found in Linden,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/linden/sections/health-and-wellness/articles/high-levels-of-cancer-causing-chemicals-found-in-linden on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9saW5kZW4vc2VjdGlvbnMvaGVhbHRoLWFuZC13ZWxsbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlcy9oaWdoLWxldmVscy1vZi1jYW5jZXItY2F1c2luZy1jaGVtaWNhbHMtZm91bmQtaW4tbGluZGVu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

An ordinance took effect in Kansas City on Aug. 6 2018 regulating and requiring permits for short-term rentals.

Four years later there were only 164 short-term rental permits issued in Kansas City according to CompassKC the city’s permit portal.

That figure is less than 10% of such short-term rentals available in the city.

In June the number of active listings of short-term rentals in Kansas City on both Airbnb and Vrbo — two popular short-term rental platforms — reached 1796 according to data from AirDNA. AirDNA is a company that compiles analytics on vacation rentals around the world.

Last Thursday City Auditor Doug Jones presented plans for an audit of short-term rentals at a City Council business session.

The audit to be released in November aims to answer two questions:



“Are short-term rental hosts complying with city registration regulations?”

“Do short-term rentals impact city convention and tourism taxes and the arena fee?”

The audit is being done in part in response to complaints from residents.

“Short-term rentals are a topic of public discussion and the city receives 311 complaints about the illegal operation and disturbances related to short-term rentals” Jones said during the business session. “The public also suggested that we audit this program.”

Jones also noted that the ordinance is almost five years old making it a good time to check on it as well as to look at the impact on the city’s tourism-related taxes and fees.

Short-term rentals in Kansas City

Airbnb is a platform specializing in short-term rental listings. It had more than 6 million listings worldwide as of March according to its website.

While other short-term rental platforms like Vrbo and TurnKey are available Airbnb dominates the Kansas City market. In April Airbnb had 1613 listings — more than 95% of the total offered by Airbnb and Vrbo rental listings that month according to data from Inside Airbnb and AirDNA.

The number of listings has continued to rise past pre-pandemic levels and since that citywide short-term rental ordinance took effect in 2018.

While data on listings before June 2019 isn’t readily available Diane Binckley deputy director of the City Planning Department estimated more than 800 short-term rentals were in the city during a recording of a city Planning Zoning and Economic Development Committee meeting on Jan. 17 2018.

The surge since then has largely affected particular neighborhoods.

Fourth District Councilman Eric Bunch said there has been a massive influx of short-term rentals in his district as well as along the KC Streetcar extension.

“Like in some cases the majority of the houses — single-family homes — on a single block are short-term rentals” Bunch said. “And I think that's problematic.”

Data on Airbnb listings from April showed a heavy concentration of listings in and around Midtown.

According to data collected by Inside Airbnb the 64111 zip code had the fifth highest number of Airbnb listings in Missouri behind zip codes in Branson Osage Beach Ridgedale and Lake Ozark in April. Inside Airbnb is described as a “mission driven project that provides data and advocacy about Airbnb's impact on residential communities.”

The 64111 zip code which includes Midtown is also home to neighborhoods like Volker that have witnessed an increase in short-term rentals in the past two years.

“It seems to be ramping especially over the last 24 months” said Patrick Faltico president of the Volker Neighborhood Association.

Volker’s boundaries stretch north to south from 31st Street to 43rd Street. Its western boundary is State Line Road and the eastern boundary is Roanoke Road north of 39th Street and Southwest Trafficway south of 39th Street.

According to Bunch the issues with rentals that lack permits are also primarily isolated to a handful of neighborhoods not far from Westport the Country Club Plaza and downtown.

Concern also exists regarding the hosts and how available they are to address concerns or issues at the rentals. In the Volker neighborhood Faltico said he hears a lot from residents about Airbnbs being operated by out-of-state entities that don’t care about their neighborhood.

Of the over 1600 Airbnb listings documented as of April the top three hosts with the highest number of Kansas City rentals were not listed as being in Kansas City according to data from Inside Airbnb. The majority of listings were hosted by Kansas City locals.

The Airbnb platform shares some information about hosts including their first name number of listings and where they are located.

“They don't know anything about the neighborhood. They just see it as investment dollars” Faltico said. “As a real estate investor myself I understand that rationale but that's not working for the neighborhood clearly.”

Mark Rodriguez treasurer for the Volker Neighborhood Association said there are responsible Airbnb operators too. One across from his house was renovated and the owner made sure to notify neighbors. This makes it easier to contact them in case of an issue.

“We can get a hold of them. That hasn't been an issue” Rodriguez said. “A lot of them don't say anything. They tried to hide in there.”

Permits and process

An analysis of records in CompassKC the city portal for permits showed a total of 509 applications entered into the system for short-term rental permits as of Aug. 5.

Of those 164 had a status listed as issued. Of the rest 141 were listed as voided-city which means they were duplicated canceled or not acted upon.

In the portal 89 were also expired and seven were listed as ready for issuance. The rest were listed under other permit statuses such as ready for issuance hold pending in review denied inactive canceled revoked and renewed.

Of two revoked permits in the portal one was revoked due to a forged signature of an adjacent neighbor according to the CompassKC portal. The other includes an attached letter in the portal explaining the revocation “due to the property failing to meet the provisions of Chapter 18-Kansas City Building and Rehabilitation Code of Ordinances.”

Faltico who also is a real estate investor recently went through the process himself to get the proper permits to operate a short-term rental. He said he has insight into both sides of the issue with the permitting process.

“It's not a real simple thing to do” Faltico said. “So I think just the fact that it's not really simple is kind of a hurdle for probably some folks.”

In Faltico’s case his short-term rental is located next to his home so while he needed to obtain signatures from adjacent properties for permission to operate he already knew his neighbors.

“For people who are out of town or property owners that don't live in the neighborhood (it) takes a much different ask” Faltico said. “Not saying they shouldn't do it. But I think I start to understand why maybe people don't.”

Faltico obtained a type 2 year-round short-term rental. In the city’s ordinance permits for short-term rentals are broken down into type 1 and type 2 permits. Type 1 permits are for owner-occupied short-term rentals while type 2 permits are for non-owner-occupied short-term rentals.

Type 1 permits are defined by city ordinance 88-321 as “a principal residential dwelling unit that is occupied by the resident (who may be either the owner or the tenant/lessee of the owner authorized by the owner to offer the unit for short term rental) for a cumulative minimum of 270 days per calendar year.”

Carlos Moreno / KCUR 89.3 Homes in the Volker neighborhood of Kansas City have become popular for AirBNB and other short-term rentals.

Two different permits also exist within the type 2 permit. Year-round permits for non-owner-occupied short-term rentals are rented more than 95 days a year and seasonal short-term rental permits are issued for rentals operating fewer than 95 days a year.

To be issued a type 2 permit and operate year-round 55% or more of adjacent property owners to the short-term rental must agree and provide a signature.

The permit process is outlined on the city’s website and includes the necessary forms to fill out for each permit type.

While a spokesperson declined to comment for this story Airbnb offers guidance to hosts on its website about different types of local regulations.

“We're committed to working with local officials to help them understand how Airbnb benefits our community. Where needed we will continue to advocate for changes that will allow regular people to rent out their own homes” said the page about regulations on Airbnb’s website.

Enforcing the ordinance

Enforcement of the short-term rental ordinance remains a concern for residents especially in highly concentrated areas like Volker.

“It's not that the city refuses to do it it's that they just can't because there are not enough resources” Faltico said.

“So my hope is that as a neighborhood advocate I can help organize and muster support for encouraging the City Council to make changes to how we compensate and try to retain these employees” Faltico said. “Because we need them. This is ridiculous that we have so many short-term rentals that are not licensed.”

Residents like Rodriguez have taken on a role in their neighborhoods to report short-term rentals that are not in compliance with the ordinance.

In addition to being treasurer Rodriguez also helps neighbors by filing short-term rental complaints for those who are afraid of facing retribution by a landlord. Some live in duplexes that are part long-term and part short-term rental.

Rodriguez has reported four unpermitted short-term rentals in Volker. One has been addressed by the city Rodriguez said. The complaint was dismissed with the city issuing a status of “insufficient evidence to proceed.” Rodriguez filed the complaint on May 3 and it was closed on June 30.

The planning department currently has two investigators that enforce the zoning ordinance in the whole city Joseph Rexwinkle division manager for the development management division of the City Planning Department said in an email. There are only six planners who issue permits.

The department is in the hiring process for more investigators and one additional planner the planning department’s Binckley said in an email also noting that planners issue multiple types of permits.

During the council business session last week where the short-term rental audit plan was presented Bunch commented on the investigations saying that there was no need for the planning department to send someone out to a rental. All they needed to do was check if a listing exists.

“And if they're not registered with the city it’s the same thing as them actually renting it out” Bunch said at the business session. “So there is no investigation needed which for some reason the planning department is still sending out people on like a Tuesday afternoon to see if there was any activity that looked like suspiciously like a short-term rental.”

An exact number of complaints about short-term rentals overall or for what specific reasons is not easily documented. For example when “short term rental” is searched in the code case category 200 results show up as of Aug. 5. When “Airbnb” is searched 145 results are returned.

“The data we have is dependent on the language used by the complainant. As an additional complication any one property may have for example 1 complaint or 20 complaints” Binckley said in an email.

Part of the short-term rental audit will include categorizing the 311 complaints in addition to comparing short-term rental registration and listing data evaluating the short-term rental registration process analyzing sales tax and room night data and to also review the laws on the collection of taxes related to short-term rentals according to the audit plan.

The audit which began in May according to Jones is set to be published in November of this year.

“Like some of the other process improvements (the City Planning Department) has made in recent months we are interested in and working toward streamlining and updating to meet current needs” Binckley said in an email when asked about how the ordinance is working.

It may be part of the reason why guests are increasingly angered by the litany of fees included in their bookings.

In Canada’s most populous city the average daily rate for a studio or one-bedroom apartment on the Airbnb platform in July was $214 according to AirDNA a short-term rental data provider. That was $33 a day less than the $247 Toronto hotels charged on average during roughly the same period according to data spanning July 1 to July 30 from STR an analytics company focused on the hospitality industry.

The average rate for studio and one-bedroom rentals which AirDNA considers comparable with hotel rooms was up 44 per cent from $148 a day in July 2019 during the summer before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. By contrast the average daily rate paid by travellers staying in Toronto hotels rose by 24 per cent over the same four summers up from an average of $199 in July 2019 according to STR.

For Airbnb listings that include larger properties – but not shared accommodations – the average daily rate in July was nearly $300 a day more than 50 per cent above average rates in July 2019 the AirDNA numbers show. The data for short-term rentals does not include service fees which can vary but often amount to an additional 10 per cent to 15 per cent the company said.

Airbnb ABNB-Q has challenged some of the data saying third-party analyses of its listings typically incur a number of issues including possibly not accurately reflecting actual bookings or what guests paid.

The short-term rentals giant said the average daily rate for Airbnb accommodations in Toronto increased approximately 15 per cent between 2019 and the first six months of 2022. It did not provide dollar amounts for average daily rates.

Hotel-like prices may help to explain some travellers’ growing angst over the many fees guests must pay in addition to the base rate advertised on the platform.

“I don’t stay in Airbnb’s anymore” U.S.-based Twitter user Michael Karnjanaprakorn recently wrote.

“Cleaning Fee: $200. Instructions: Clean the dishes take out the trash and wash all the sheets before you leave” the tweet which received more than 27000 likes reads.

In a press release last year Airbnb addressed criticism over fees noting that users can see a detailed breakdown of potential charges prior to committing to a booking.

Cleaning fees are set by hosts based on factors such as the size of the home location amenities and the number of guests. “We believe that hosts having autonomy over their own pricing helps empower them to achieve success on our platform” the company wrote.

Enhanced cleaning protocols because of COVID-19 might have also increased cleaning expenses for some hosts the company noted.

Other fees include a service charge – usually under 14.2 per cent of the booking subtotal – collected by Airbnb and occupancy taxes imposed by the government the company said. (In Toronto for example Airbnb has been collecting a 4-per-cent municipal tax since the start of 2021.)

But Airbnb’s PR response has hardly appeased disgruntled guests. Travel expert Matthew Kepnes for example said he has forsaken Airbnb for good.

Mr. Kepnes who runs the website nomadicmatt.com argued Airbnb rentals are no longer a good deal for short-term stays especially in large cities where there are plenty of hotel options.

“If you’re just going to New York for three days it doesn’t really make sense” he said.

In part that’s because fees can significantly add to the cost of a brief stay according to Mr. Kepnes. In a tweet from February 2020 he referenced an Airbnb listing with a $100-a-night base rate and a $200 cleaning fee. “These cleaning fees are so onerous. I might as well just stay in a hotel for that price!” he wrote.

Mr. Kepnes also has qualms with Airbnb’s customer service which he said makes it hard to obtain refunds. That’s another point in favour of hotels he argued.

Aside from costs he also has ethical reservations about using short-term rentals in large metropolitan areas. In many big cities services such as Airbnb are taking much-needed housing stock away from prospective homeowners and long-term renters he said.

Still Airbnb may be a good choice in more remote areas especially when booking longer stays he said.

A growing number of travellers may be coming to Mr. Kepnes’ conclusion about shorter versus longer bookings. Since the start of the pandemic Airbnb has seen a surge of longer bookings. Stays of 28 days or more were up 25 per cent in the second quarter of 2022 compared with the same period in 2021 and nearly 90 per cent above levels recorded in the second quarter of 2019 the company said during its latest earnings release.

Bookings of around a month or more have become its fastest-growing trip type by length Airbnb said.

In February 2019 Derek Cheung took a big leap of faith into real estate when he signed leases on two apartments in Austin Texas to be used as short-term rentals. At the time he was attending the University of Texas at Austin working toward a joint bachelor's degree in business administration and finance while living in a dorm and using student loans to cover his expenses he said.

He wanted to work for himself and had recently discovered the world of rental arbitrage — leasing apartments to sublet as short-term rentals — and how it had allowed others to attain their goals of being self-employed and financially independent. He had always aspired to be an entrepreneur after reading Robert Kiyosaki's ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" He hadn't told his parents what he was up to fearing they wouldn't approve.

Cheung got the idea while he was doing an internship at a private-equity firm. During one of the meetings an investment partner mentioned a company called Sonder a firm that manages short-term rentals it doesn't own. Cheung was particularly interested in rental arbitration because of the low barrier to entry. He was also inspired by the founder of Sonder Francis Davidson who started the company out of his college apartment.

That meeting would change the course of Cheung's life. Within a couple of weeks he would land his first two apartments. By 2021 — three years into his rental-arbitrage career — he told Insider he had more than 50 properties nationwide.

In 2021 his business Hikaru LLC had a net income of $754547 from a gross profit of $1989839 according to the profit-and-loss statement viewed by Insider. His expenses for the same period came to $1249916. His highest expense was rent to the tune of about $503500. Cleaning expenses were second at $128500. Other big-ticket expenses included paying for repairs and maintenance at the apartments which cost $45700; property-manager fees of $55515; and total advertising costs of $18465.45.

Getting his foot in the door

Cheung started his journey in rental arbitrage by doing research online and reading a lot of blog posts about experiences others had with the business model.

There were two key takeaways from what he was reading. First he needed an LLC because he would be signing a lease to conduct business rather than occupy the units as a resident. Second he realized that some landlords actually had a preference for working with rental-arbitrage operators over traditional long-term renters because operators took care of the property cleaned it regularly and fixed anything their guests may be at fault for breaking he said. Cheung considered these key points when he drafted his pitch to landlords.

He then went on to build his list of available properties. He searched websites like Zillow RentCafe and Apartments.com for available occupancy in Austin and then created an Excel sheet with about 160 leads with contact information.

With a scripted pitch he called or emailed landlords outside his area of interest in San Antonio Texas. He did this to practice before reaching out to properties in Austin. He would adjust the script based on objections and concerns the landlords voiced. He told Insider he reached out to about 100 leads before he landed on a person willing to entertain his pitch — a broker who had listed a property on behalf of a landlord.

Since the agent represented other landlords Cheung explained his business model and convinced her to tap her network to find other landlords who might be interested in working with him. The agent set him up with his first ""yes"" from a building manager who agreed to lease him his first two units in the same building in Austin.

By February 2019 he signed his first one-year leases. The first apartment was a one-bedroom for $1215 a month; the second was a studio apartment for $999 a month according to the contracts viewed by Insider. He paid the first month's rent plus an additional $500 security deposit for each unit for a total of $3214. He had an additional contract allowing him to operate short-term rentals at the property.

He told Insider that at the time he had $8000 in cash saved from his server job in high school and his internship. He also had a credit card that had a $5000 available limit. He spent about $5000 furnishing the units with used items purchased through Facebook Marketplace. Two of his friends helped him move furniture using a U-Haul rental. Once everything was set up he took photos and posted the units on Airbnb.

To his surprise he landed his first booking — for two days at the one-bedroom unit — the same day he listed them.

""I was insanely excited and it was pretty much like instant. As soon as I listed someone was inquiring"" Cheung said of the experience. ""And as soon as they inquired I was talking to them. And then when the booking got solidified it really validated the business model in my mind.""

Cheung recalled his revenue was about $4000 a month with a profit of about $1500 for both units combined. He said he had an occupancy rate of about 80% to 86%. In the first two months he would make a point to talk to every guest leave small gifts and point them to the best spots in town.

The turning point that scaled him

A few months in he hosted a guest that stayed in one of his units for 60 days — a construction-company owner who told Cheung he was in town for a project his company had landed. The business owner needed housing for 33 of his crew members. Cheung offered to help him find places for his employees at a cheaper rate than a hotel. This deal landed him the biggest check he had ever seen: $45000 for two months of rentals. Cheung had three weeks to secure furnished accommodations.

""I already knew that as long as I put in enough time to make the calls I'm going to be able to land as many deals as I need"" Cheung said. ""So I was already pretty confident that as long as I put in the volume I can get the houses no problem.""

He planned to land a few houses with numerous bedrooms. He hit the books and spent about a week calling properties before he secured three three-bedroom houses and a duplex that had six bedrooms in Austin. He spoke to the landlords and explained the situation noting that after the employees left he would be listing the properties on Airbnb over the term of the one-year lease.

Cheung was now on the hook for another $8000 each month in rent. He used the cash deposit to pay for the first two months' rent and furnish the properties. He was now managing and cleaning six properties.

""It was pretty scary having $10000 a month in liability and rent expenses. Basically I just saw that I needed to get it booked as far in advance as I could"" Cheung said of the situation. ""I put all of the listings on Airbnb. I put them on Vrbo as well. And I actually bought a subscription to a database for construction companies so I could see which companies landed new jobs in the area. And I did the same thing where I built a lead list and I made my email scripts and templates.""

To his benefit the first construction company extended its rentals beyond the initial two months staying from September 2019 until May 2020 he said. He told Insider he received about $12000 a month (netting a $4000 profit a month) from this deal. He used the new cash flow to sign another three leases for units in the first building.

At first he was wary of expanding because he was trying to save twice the rent he owed on all units as a security nest egg. But he was worried that if he didn't lock down the available units they would get leased and he would lose out on the opportunity. So he powered through telling himself that in order to make money he had to risk money.

During his fall semester he hired his first cleaning company to take over the duties he was handling. He quickly realized it was difficult to secure a partnership with a reliable company and cycled through three or four companies he said. At times he found himself going in to clean the units himself if they hadn't done a good job.

""Now what I do is whenever I take on a new cleaning team I have about four cleaning teams come in to interview. I set specific traps where I would place Kleenex under the couch et cetera just to see if they are detail-oriented and they catch those items"" he said.

If guests find a unit unclean Airbnb can issue a refund leaving the property manager on the hook for the money he noted.

Hitting a wall

One of his biggest mistakes was expanding to three additional units in March 2020 as the country went into COVID lockdown. Travel slowed and bookings were drying up.

Events like South by Southwest a major festival that takes place in Austin every year was canceled. People were canceling bookings left and right he said.

He was facing $20000 a month in liabilities that he was responsible for. He began to cold-call and email construction companies corporate-relocation firms and insurance housing to offer his units on a weekly basis. He posted his units on every platform he could including Zillow Corporate Housing by Owner Furnished Finder and Craigslist. He also prioritized guests that booked for 60 days or more.

""A lot of the hosts went out of business but I basically was spending every single waking hour trying to get my units booked adjusting the pricing and things of that nature"" Cheung said.

He eventually dropped out of college and by June 2020 he had to leave his dorm room. He was left sleeping in his Nissan Altima for about two and a half months he said. At times he would sleep in one of his vacant Airbnb units.

His goal was to reduce his rates just enough so he could break even or make a slight profit. He also focused on landing longer-term guests. He began booking locals who were between leases people who were evicted from their homes and insurance companies booking temporary accommodations.

He broke even in March and May thanks to the construction company that had extended. And he was able to make a slight profit in April he said. His big takeaway: Pay attention to the macroeconomic environment.

Other buildings in Austin were also struggling with pandemic-related vacancies. By the time 2021 rolled around Cheung told Insider he was able to pick up several units in one building in exchange for one to two months of free rent.

He also opened business credit cards with Chase and Amex and charged furniture costs so he didn't have to pay anything out of pocket for those first months. He said he made back the cost of furniture within two months.

By August 2021 bookings began to pick up. By the end of 2021 he had accumulated 50 properties 44 of which were already operational. He told Insider his nightly rates run between $101 to $223 on average. He added that the occupancy rate for his units are between 72% to 97% depending on the month. After Airbnb fees are deducted his aggregate average for 2021 was about $134 a night on an 87% occupancy rate he said.

He has continued to expand his short-term-rental business growing by roughly 22% in revenue this year according to his company's profit-and-loss statement. Based on the challenges he faced he feels confident his business will be a success.

""That was probably the biggest challenge I faced in my time with the Airbnb business was taking it through COVID and obviously I did get through"" Cheung said."

Mauch who works as a senior network architect for Akamai moved into his home in 2002. He acquired a T1 line at a time when 1.5 Mbps was considered to be an excellent Internet connection. Mauch anticipated that as broadband technology developed an ISP would eventually install cable or fibre in his home. It never took place.

Later he changed to a wireless Internet service provider that offered 50Mbps of speed. When Mauch contacted Comcast at one point the company estimated it would cost $50000 to connect its cable network to his home.

Mauch received DSL from AT&T the incumbent phone provider roughly five years ago according to him. However the top speed of AT&T's announced plans for his neighbourhood was a meagre 1.5Mbps which was adequate in 2002 but not in 2020. Users like Mauch are left without many good options because AT&T ceased providing basic DSL to new customers in October and hasn't upgraded many rural locations to newer substitutes.

Mauch claimed to have spent roughly $145000 (over ₹1 crore) of which $95000 (about ₹75 lakh) was paid to the contractor who set up the majority of the fibre conduits. In order to avoid gas pipes and other impediments the fibre cables are typically six feet underground and up to twenty feet underground in some circumstances.

However Mauch began making plans to create his own company approximately four years ago and as a result some areas of Lima Township and Scio Township now have fibre-to-the-home broadband service. Mauch started connecting his first customers a few months ago and has since deployed five kilometres of fibre.

Mauch had wired 30 homes as of the beginning of January and had about 10 more to do so. Instead of his initial estimate of about 35% it has really been closer to 70% of potential purchasers. Mauch claims that the customers he has not yet reached out to mostly rely on cell phone service.

Mauch had anticipated spending $60000 (around ₹47 lakh) on the project but the final cost was more than twice that. Some clients contributed $5000 (Around ₹3.9 lakh) upfront to help with construction costs and in return they will receive service credits for several years now that the network has been installed. Mauch calculates that he will reach break even in 42 months based on the amount he invested and the revenue he anticipates.

Government funding of $2.6 million (almost ₹21 crore) is helping Mauch grow. For $55 per month Mauch will offer 100Mbps symmetrical Internet with unlimited data and for $79 per month it will offer 1Gbps with unlimited data. Mauch stated that his standard installation costs are $199. Mauch offers straightforward bills with only one line item for Internet service and no additional charges in contrast to many larger ISPs.

Newtownards schoolgirl Lucy McGonigle is now officially the fittest teenager in the world.

In Madison Wisconsin last weekend the 15-year-old won her age group at the World CrossFit Games.

The Regent House pupil overcame opponents from America Spain Iceland and France to take the much sought-after gold medal in front of thousands of CrossFit fans at the Alliant Energy Center.

CrossFit is a high-intensity fitness regime incorporating Olympic weightlifting plyometrics powerlifting gymnastics kettlebell lifting strongman events and a range of other exercises.

The World CrossFit Games is the competitive version of the training programme pitting the world’s fittest athletes against each other in a series of events. The Games are broadcast live on American television and streamed around the world.

Last Sunday McGonigle took the girls’ 15 and under title with a string of impressive displays in such curiously-named events as the Skills Chipper Parallel Elizabeth Mixed Mode Madness and Carrying Karen.

It was a proud moment forr the prevailing Lucy who claimed silver in the same age category last summer.

Reflecting on her incredible week in Wisconsin she said: “I’m really delighted to have won the Crossfit Games.

“The programming was definitely different and more challenging this year compared to last year but it was a good test of my skills. It was great to win the title after coming so close in 2021.

“When I started CrossFit at nine years old I dreamed to one day compete at the CrossFit Games so it was a dream come true when I competed for the first time last year.

“But to actually win the title is just amazing. It’s way beyond my wildest dreams.

“I can’t wait to see what the next few years of hard work bring for me. Eventually I want to compete in the senior competition at the CrossFit Games but I’m also involved in competitive weightlifting so I have a few different options.”

While the World CrossFit Games is a global event weightlifting offers the Ards teenager an Olympic pathway. Lucy is part of the British Weightlifting training programme and was recently named in the Team GB squad for the European Championships.

McGonigle first picked up weights when she went to the gym to improve her strength for swimming. The keen athlete raced competitively for Ards Swimming Club before switching focus to CrossFit.

She explained: “I joined CrossFit Enable in Dundonald when I was only nine as a way of getting fitter and stronger. I really enjoyed it and I just stuck with it.

“My coach Sam Duckett has really helped me every step of the way. I train four hours a day. With support from Sam and my parents I am able to balance to my training and my schoolwork.

“It’s worth the hard work when you win competitions like the CrossFit Games.”

Her work in the gym has certainly paid off. The 15 year-old can deadlift 130kg back squat 105kg and run 5k in 23 minutes.

Next year McGonigle plans to return to Wisconsin for the 2023 World CrossFit Games where she will hope to land gold in the Under-17 section before eventually graduating to the senior women’s competition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbGZhc3RsaXZlLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L290aGVyLXNwb3J0L2F0aGxldGljcy9jby1kb3duLWF0aGxldGUtYmVjb21lcy1maXR0ZXN0LTI0NzQ5NjE20gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVsZmFzdGxpdmUuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvb3RoZXItc3BvcnQvYXRobGV0aWNzL2NvLWRvd24tYXRobGV0ZS1iZWNvbWVzLWZpdHRlc3QtMjQ3NDk2MTYuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Co Down athlete becomes 'Fittest Teen on Earth' after big win in USA,"Something went wrong please try again later.

A County Down athlete can claim to be the 'Fittest Teenager on Earth' after coming out on top at the CrossFit Games in the USA.

Lucy McGonigle saw off all competition to win the 14-15 age group at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison Wisconsin.

The 15-year-old from Newtownards finished second at the competition 12 months ago but went one step further this time by winning the gold medal.

During the Games she had to take part in a series of gruelling events including the Skills Chipper Parallel Elizabeth Rinse 'N' Repeat and Carrying Karen. They take in various disciplines including weightlifting running and gymnastics.

At the end of the competition she was top of the leaderboard on 660 points some 100 points ahead of nearest rival Rylee Beebe.

Lucy said: ""I finished second last year so there was a bit of expectation this time round. I was probably one of the better known athletes competing there.

""So there was a bit more pressure but I enjoyed the whole experience. I competed over three days from Thursday to Saturday in the 14-15 years age group.

""Now I am the 'Fittest Teen on Earth' which is a nice title to have.

""The competition was fierce and also the heat out there got to me a lot. It was 37 degrees for one of the outdoor events I had to do and that was early in the morning.

""I had to do various disciplines including running gymnastics weight lifting - literally everything thrown into one. Any discipline can be thrown in such as paddle boarding kayaking bikes - anything.

""And we never know until the day before what we are doing. It is all kept a secret. You just have to prepare as well as you can and make sure you have a whole bunch of variety thrown into your training and preparation.""

Lucy was training for six hours a day in the lead-up to the CrossFit Games. During school term she trains at least three hours every day.

It is a sacrifice she is happy to make after claiming gold in America.

""I train about for about three hours a day during the school term because that's all I can fit in. But coming up to a competition I would be training six hours a day split into two three-hour sessions"" she explained.

""It is tough trying to squeeze everything in but it is okay. You have to prioritise your time.

""And then when to win a major competition it makes it all worthwhile. I think you have to love it.

""Some people can't understand why I put in so many hours but it is a passion. It's all or nothing with CrossFit because you can't go into it half-hearted.""

Lucy has been training out of CrossFit Enable gym since she was just nine years old and has been working with coach Sam Duckett for the past six years.

""The CrossFit Enable gym has been fantastic along the way. The whole community has been a massive help in my career and I can't thank them enough"" she said.

""It is always good to go in and see everyone. I started CrossFit when I was nine years old. I used to swim and I joined CrossFit to help that.

""But then things reversed and I continued CrossFit and gave up swimming. I loved it from an early stage and things have really taken off.

""You can only start to compete when you turn 14 and then lockdown delayed things for a while.

""So I have only really competed in about four or five big competitions. My first competition was actually the CrossFit Games last year.

""That was massive a real baptism of fire.""

Lucy returned home earlier this week before heading off to Poland for this weekend's European Youth Weightlifting Championships.

The teen - who is current British weightlifting record holder at Under 23 20 and 17 level - will represent Team GB for the first time at the competition in Raszyn.

""I have a weightlifting competition in Poland. That is my first run with Team GB which is exciting"" she added.

""I was able to relax for a couple of days after returning from Wisconsin and then the focus turned to Poland.

""After that then I will be able to relax a bit more and take time off. I can recharge for a couple of weeks.

""I don't like taking too much time off.""

However Google Fiber is back seven years later planning to expand to more cities.

It’s important to note that Google Fiber never went away. In 2015 when the company became an independent unit under the Alphabet Inc umbrella and subsequently took a break from expanding its operations it promised to continue supporting the services it had already installed. Despite annual losses the company did just that but had to shift operations to keep the costs down.

However we were treated to a surprise when Google Fiber announced that it is now ready to “add a little bit more velocity” after this long hiatus when it focused on tightening operations. Dinni Jain announced the expansion Google Fiber’s Chief Executive who exclusively told Reuters that it plans to bring its high-speed internet service to multiple cities in Arizona Colorado Idaho Nebraska and Nevada over the next several years.

It’s great to see Fiber pick up where it left off and continue to expand. Unfortunately for most users their plan right now is not to expand through all of the United States and take over ISP giants like Comcast and AT&T. However it will continue to pursue its mission to provide wireless service through its Webpass brand for multi-unit buildings and in some cases will lease local fiber networks from other providers to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMi8wOC8yODQ4NDUzNS9hcy10ZXNsYS1wcmVwYXJlcy10by1zcGxpdC1zaGFyZXMtaGVyZXMtYS1sb29rLWF0LWhvdy0xLTAwMC1pbnZlc3RlZC1lYWNoLWluLWFtYXpvbi1hbHBoYWJldC1haGVhZC1v0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVuemluZ2EuY29tL2FtcC9jb250ZW50LzI4NDg0NTM1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ahead Of Tesla Share Split Here's How Much $1000 Invested In Amazon Alphabet Before Their 2022 Stock S,"Tesla Inc.’s TSLA shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Aug. 25. Expectations are that the stock will trade up in the run-up to the split.

Incidentally two other big techs - Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG recently split their shares. Does the post-split trading in these stocks have any read across for Tesla?

It could be a ""yes"" and ""no."" Tesla is not strictly a tech company and its tryst with technology is primarily through the self-driving tech it is promoting for its electric vehicles and its usage of AI for the same.

However Tesla is a fellow large-cap just like Amazon and Alphabet. Another factor working in favor of all the three stocks is the sense of optimism that has returned to the market following the recent Main Street data point showing a let-up in inflationary pressure.

Amazon Since Split Announcement: E-commerce giant Amazon announced a 20-for-1 stock split on March 9. The board also approved a $10 billion stock buyback program.

The stock began to trade on a split-adjusted basis on June 6.

Assuming $1000 was invested in Amazon shares coinciding with the split announcement an investor would have had 7.2 shares based on the split-adjusted closing price of $139.28 on March 9. The same shares would be worth $1033.56 now a return of 3.5%.

If a person had invested $1000 just before the stock split took effect they would have pocketed a return of 17.3%.

Alphabet Since Split Announcement: Alphabet also split its shares in the ratio of 20-for-1 this year with the announcement regarding the corporate action coming on Feb. 1. The stock began to trade on a split-adjusted basis on July 18.

Someone who invested $1000 in Class A shares of Alphabet around the announcement of the split would have received 7.3 shares. At Friday’s closing price these shares would have fetched $884 a negative return of 11.6%. Incidentally the market was in the doldrums until the first half of the year due to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.

Alternatively if $1000 were invested in the shares ahead of the stock split taking effect it would have generated a return of 8.9%.

Telsa’s Split Could Be A Different Story: If the economic fundamentals don’t deteriorate and the market can sustain the recent upward momentum there's a potential for Tesla to rally into Aug. 25 and maybe after.

Future Fund’s Gary Black said he sees Tesla stock reclaiming the $926 level at which it closed on Aug. 4 the day before Elon Musk resumed selling Tesla shares. Musk sold shares on Aug. 5 8 and 9.

“No reason TSLA can’t reclaim $926 going into 3:1 split on 8/25 macro permitting” Black said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MtdGVjaG5vbG9neS95b3V0dWJlLXBsYW5zLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1zdHJlYW1pbmctdmlkZW8tc2VydmljZS1yZXBvcnQtODA4ODA0MC_SAYYBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGVjaC1uZXdzLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kveW91dHViZS1wbGFucy10by1sYXVuY2gtc3RyZWFtaW5nLXZpZGVvLXNlcnZpY2UtcmVwb3J0LTgwODgwNDAvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,YouTube plans to launch streaming video service: Report,"Alphabet Inc’s YouTube is planning to launch an online store for streaming video services the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.

As of now there is no official confirmation nor any word as to when the store will be live.

While Alphabet Inc has not officially released any press statements a close source from the company has reported that the company plans to set the store on floors by the end of this fall.

The streaming market is the current “big thing” and almost all major companies are in the horde to launch their respective platforms to raise up the stakes. Apple has it already going great with it’s Apple TV. It is expected that the Walmart Inc is also joining the crowd and is in talks with various media houses for a similar fest.

The shift from cable TVs to OTTs

The boom of the new boy “OTT” platform has raced past the age old cable-TVs recently when the world was locked up inside their homes. With almost all major countries providing access to unlimited and fast internet people were quick to shift from the traditional usage of TV-channels to the new fast paced OTT content. Almost every household is now adapted to this change and for the right reasons as the idea of accessing entertainment anywhere-and-everywhere is quite convenient as compared to older times.

It is hence very much expected from YouTube to keep an eye on the market and plunge into the already blooming streaming services market. As to how well the plan is executed is yet to be seen."

It could be a ""yes"" and ""no."" Tesla is not strictly a tech company and its tryst with technology is primarily through the self-driving tech it is promoting for its electric vehicles and its usage of AI for the same.

However Tesla is a fellow large-cap just like Amazon and Alphabet. Another factor working in favor of all the three stocks is the sense of optimism that has returned to the market following the recent Main Street data point showing a let-up in inflationary pressure.

Amazon Since Split Announcement: E-commerce giant Amazon announced a 20-for-1 stock split on March 9. The board also approved a $10 billion stock buyback program.

The stock began to trade on a split-adjusted basis on June 6.

Assuming $1000 was invested in Amazon shares coinciding with the split announcement an investor would have had 7.2 shares based on the split-adjusted closing price of $139.28 on March 9. The same shares would be worth $1033.56 now a return of 3.5%.

If a person had invested $1000 just before the stock split took effect they would have pocketed a return of 17.3%.

Alphabet Since Split Announcement: Alphabet also split its shares in the ratio of 20-for-1 this year with the announcement regarding the corporate action coming on Feb. 1. The stock began to trade on a split-adjusted basis on July 18.

Someone who invested $1000 in Class A shares of Alphabet around the announcement of the split would have received 7.3 shares. At Friday’s closing price these shares would have fetched $884 a negative return of 11.6%. Incidentally the market was in the doldrums until the first half of the year due to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.

Alternatively if $1000 were invested in the shares ahead of the stock split taking effect it would have generated a return of 8.9%.

Telsa’s Split Could Be A Different Story: If the economic fundamentals don’t deteriorate and the market can sustain the recent upward momentum there's a potential for Tesla to rally into Aug. 25 and maybe after.

Future Fund’s Gary Black said he sees Tesla stock reclaiming the $926 level at which it closed on Aug. 4 the day before Elon Musk resumed selling Tesla shares. Musk sold shares on Aug. 5 8 and 9.

“No reason TSLA can’t reclaim $926 going into 3:1 split on 8/25 macro permitting” Black said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MtdGVjaG5vbG9neS95b3V0dWJlLXBsYW5zLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1zdHJlYW1pbmctdmlkZW8tc2VydmljZS1yZXBvcnQtODA4ODA0MC_SAYYBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGVjaC1uZXdzLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kveW91dHViZS1wbGFucy10by1sYXVuY2gtc3RyZWFtaW5nLXZpZGVvLXNlcnZpY2UtcmVwb3J0LTgwODgwNDAvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,YouTube plans to launch streaming video service: Report,"Alphabet Inc’s YouTube is planning to launch an online store for streaming video services the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.

As reported by The Wall Street journal YouTube might launch a new online store for streaming videos. “Channel Store” is what the company is referring to the aforementioned store internally. The reports are that YouTube is trying map deals with various entertainment platforms to provide participation for the same.

YouTube’s streaming service might be here soon

As of now there is no official confirmation nor any word as to when the store will be live. But the product has been in the works for 18 months as of now and YouTube is firm on launching the service sometime soon this fall. While Alphabet Inc has not officially released any press statements a close source from the company has reported that the company plans to set the store on floors by the end of this fall.

The streaming market is the current “big thing” and almost all major companies are in the horde to launch their respective platforms to raise up the stakes. Apple has it already going great with it’s Apple TV. It is expected that the Walmart Inc is also joining the crowd and is in talks with various media houses for a similar fest.

The shift from cable TVs to OTTs

The boom of the new boy “OTT” platform has raced past the age old cable-TVs recently when the world was locked up inside their homes. With almost all major countries providing access to unlimited and fast internet people were quick to shift from the traditional usage of TV-channels to the new fast paced OTT content. Almost every household is now adapted to this change and for the right reasons as the idea of accessing entertainment anywhere-and-everywhere is quite convenient as compared to older times.

It is hence very much expected from YouTube to keep an eye on the market and plunge into the already blooming streaming services market. As to how well the plan is executed is yet to be seen."

This article explains how to put an Amazon tablet in kid mode. The instructions apply to all Amazon Fire tablet models.

How Do I Change My Amazon Tablet to Kid Mode?

Before you can change to this mode you need to set up a child profile using the Amazon Kids app. You can have up to four child profiles per device. If you've already created a child profile on your account you can use the Amazon Kids app to customize what content your child can access.



Open the Amazon Kids app. If you don't see it on your home screen download it from the Amazon Appstore.

Tap Use Amazon Kids With Your Own Content. Alternatively you can choose to sign up for Amazon Kids+. An Amazon Kids+ account isn't necessary to make a child profile.

Amazon Kids+ (formerly known as FreeTime) is a subscription service that gives your child unlimited access to hundreds of age-appropriate books and apps. Tap Add a new profile or choose a child profile if you have already set up one. When creating an account provide your child's name and birthdate. If your device doesn't have a password you'll be prompted to create one.

Tap Learn more to read about the different features you can control or tap Continue. Use the slider to choose an access level (Limited Moderate or Full). Underneath you can toggle individual features. Tap Continue when you're satisfied. All of these settings can be changed later after you finish setting up the child profile. Choose which apps you want to allow access to on the child profile then tap Continue. Choose how you want to receive notifications about your child's activities then tap Continue. You'll arrive at the home screen for Amazon Kids. Anytime you want to switch to kid mode open the Amazon Kids app and tap the child profile. The first time you may see a pop-up letting you know the profile will be added to your lock screen. Tap Continue.

Change What Happens When You Put an Amazon Fire in Kid Mode

By default kid mode is limited to a few apps that come preloaded on the device. To manage the types of content your child can access open the Amazon Kids app and tap the Settings gear next to the child profile. If you want to add approved apps and websites or share YouTube videos tap Add Content.



Control Child Profiles From the Amazon Parent Dashboard

Once you've created a child profile you can log in to the Amazon Parent Dashboard in any web browser to see a log of each profile's activity. Select the Settings gear next to a profile to set daily screentime limits disable in-app purchases and set up Alexa parental controls for smart home devices like your Amazon Echo or Echo Show.

Amazon Fire Tablet Parental Controls

In addition to creating child profiles you can set up parental controls on your Fire tablet to prevent purchases and limit access to certain apps. Just like with switching out of kid mode a password is required to turn off parental controls.

Go to Settings > Parental Controls and turn on Parental Controls. You can then configure controls for the active profile or tap Household Profiles to edit restrictions for each profile.

Amazon Fire Tablets for Kids

Amazon makes tablets specifically for kids such as the Fire HD 10 Kids. On top of the durable design with a thick plastic casing the purchase price of Fire Kids tablets includes a year of Amazon Kids+ and advanced parental control options. Once you set up the Fire Kids tablet with your Amazon account you can control it remotely from your own device with the Amazon Parent Dashboard.



Set Up an Amazon Teen Account

For older kids Amazon offers teen profiles. With teen profiles kids can put items in your shopping cart but they can't complete purchases without your approval. Just head over to the Amazon teen account setup page and select Sign Up Now."

Stadium Info FANFARE Score: 3.57

American Airlines Center 2500 Victory Ave Dallas TX 75219





Year Opened: 2001

Capacity: 18532









Stars Shine Bright in Dallas

American Airlines Center (AAC) is a multi-use arena located in the Victory Park area which is just north of the historic West End in downtown Dallas. The venue is home to the Dallas Stars of the NHL and the Dallas Mavericks of the NBA. AAC as it is commonly referred to by local sports fans opened in 2001 replacing the outdated Reunion Arena. The venue is made of brick limestone and granite with signature arches and costs $420 million to build.

American Airlines Center is the primary venue in the Dallas / Fort Worth (DFW) area hosting year-round sporting events and live entertainment. The seating capacity for hockey is 18532 or up to 19323 including standing room. American Airlines Center hosted the 55th NHL All-Star game in 2007.

Food & Beverage 4

There is no shortage of food or beverages when attending an event at American Airlines Center. It doesn’t matter if your tickets are on the lower platinum or upper level; you’ll find something to satisfy your appetite. However the prices will be the typically inflated stadium/arena prices. Nevertheless there are a few game days specials that could save a couple of dollars. The best choice is the small soda for $4 or the $7 bottomless popcorn if you just want a snack (regular popcorn costs almost as much and doesn’t come with refills).

There is an abundance of concessions stands throughout the arena including Big Dawgs Pizza Hut Fast Break Taco Bueno Grilled Zone High Steaks Hot Popped and Twisted Bubba Burger BBQ Stampede and Motley’s Pub. In addition if none of the above satisfies your appetite there is also Market to Go which offers fresh deli sandwiches vegetarian options tossed salads and bottled beer. To see the incredible variety that American Airlines Center offers when it comes to food service please visit their concessions website.

There are numerous alcohol selections inside American Airlines Center not just at the concession stands but also at specialty beer bars such as the Texas Beer Bar which serves Ziegenbock St Arnold’s Fireman’s 4 and Franconia. In addition there is the Blue Moon Bar which offers all the Blue Moon products as well as Import and Craft bars with beers from around the world such as Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale (OR) Goose Island (Chicago) Brooklyn Lager (NY) Alaskan Amber (AK) Kirin Ichiban (Japan) and Stone Arrogant Bastard (CA). The prices all range from $10 to 15 dollars depending on size; Woodbridge wine is also sold for $10 a glass.

Besides alcohol Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper products are also offered with prices of $6 for the regular size and $10 for the bottomless souvenir cup.

In addition to the concessions stands and specialty bars American Airlines Center features full-service restaurants – the most popular would-be Jack Daniels Old No. 7 Club which is full service with outdoor seating and is located on the southeast corner; however you’ll need an event ticket to enter this restaurant. The Club opens 2 hours before all Stars games allowing you to relax before the game and is a sports bar with food such as brisket wings nachos and other sports bar favorites but there is a separate area inside the Old No. 7 Club on the lower level that provides a more global dining experience.

Another restaurant option inside the arena is Terrace Taproom a brand-new space that features a large array of local craft beers along with a variety of bratwursts; this restaurant is located outside section 305. Alternatively platinum-level seating will grant you access to the rest of the unique bars here at American Airlines Center such as Lexus Platinum Club Arrangement Club and Chef’s Corner.

Despite all the options at American Airlines Center just like any arena the best option is to eat before or after the event as there are plenty of great restaurant options in and around Dallas.

Atmosphere 3

The atmosphere begins before American Airlines Center’s doors even open on the south side of the arena in AT&T Plaza @ Victory Park. On this plaza there are games music and just a festive atmosphere overall. There are also several video displays mounted on the side of the arena and on nearby office buildings which allow the plaza to be used for outdoor events such as Dallas’ New Year’s Eve party.

Once inside American Airlines Center there are free programs and other giveaways for fans after passing through the facility’s metal detectors. Many fans arrive early to watch the players warm up especially opposing team fans who gather around the visiting team’s entrance onto the ice. The Stars fans are also loyal vocal and knowledgeable and thus are always into the game.

The introduction for the Dallas Stars includes a smoking neon green star through which the players come onto the ice. Once the lights come on the national anthems are sung by local favorite Celena Rae. Just like Baltimore Orioles fans Stars fans emphasize the word in the national anthem relating to their team so the word ‘stars’ is yelled by the fans when it is sung during the anthem. There are also the NHL traditional ceremonial puck drops as well as the promotional events in-between periods such as human bowling where a fan on a sled gets pushed toward a bunch of pins. In addition you can find Stars gear at the Stars pro shop which is named “The Hangar”.

When the Stars are in the playoffs and American Airlines Center is packed with Stars fans the atmosphere can be electrifying especially with the “Let’s Go Stars” chants. While those nights have been few and far between since their 1999 Stanley Cup season there are always those special occasions or opposing teams that bring the Stars faithful out in full force. When the Stars become competitive and are regularly in the post-season that type of atmosphere will return on a more regular basis.

Neighborhood 5

American Airlines Center is located on the northwest edge of downtown Dallas just a short walk from Dallas’ Historic West End. The West End area consists of a list of restaurants such as Sonny Bryan’s Smokehouse Y.O. Ranch Steakhouse Gator’s TGI Friday’s Spaghetti Warehouse Hard Rock Cafe Dick’s Last Resort and House of Blues. Besides restaurants the area also has tourist attractions – the Perot Museum of Nature and Science Sixth Floor Museum and Holocaust Museum are all within the West End.

Just outside the south entrance of the arena is Victory Plaza. This plaza consists of a few shops but Hero has massive digs for food and drinks while on the east side of the arena across from the ticket booth and next to the Lexus parking garage is Mio Nonno Trattoria – these are good options if you want to hang out outside the arena. If you don’t mind a little walk then there is Mesero a very good Mexican restaurant and Billy Can-Can a place for dinner and cocktails. The Dallas/Fort Worth area provides one of the largest urban centers in the United States – within a short drive there are plenty of amazing restaurants and attractions to explore while visiting the Metroplex.

Dallas has numerous lodging options around American Airlines Center especially in the Market Center area (only 2 miles north of ACC). Some of the hotels to consider are the W Dallas Victory Renaissance Dallas Hotel Doubletree Market Center Holiday Inn Dallas Market Center and the Hilton Anatole.

The Dallas Stars operate in an area where football and the Dallas Cowboys are the leading topics of conversation in the local sports scene. However no fans are more loyal to their team than Dallas Stars fans. While the average attendance at American Airlines Center falls in the middle of the league considering that the team is in a warm climate in a football-crazed state that level of attendance is a very good testament to the solid fan base.

Dallas Stars fans are knowledgeable fun and love their Stars because true hockey fans seem to have a true loyalty to the sport. Although the team has had some down years since their last championship in 1999 their fans show support at the box office. While the Stars are currently in the middle of the pack compared to the rest of the NHL a consistent playoff-bound team on the ice will bring DFW fans to AAC – this will produce an increase in attendance along with sellout games.

Access 3

American Airlines Center is one of the better downtown venues when it comes to parking with about 5000 parking spaces available for guests. The parking lots open two hours before the start of a Stars game and both cash and credit cards are accepted at American Airlines Center-managed lots with prices from $15 to $25. Also while the Lexus Garage across from the box office is primarily reserved for season ticket holders there may be limited space for $25. And if the parking garages are not available there is also parking around the arena a short walk away – the best parking option is the popular West End area where you can enjoy a pregame meal before a short walk to the arena. But the best way to save money and time when attending a Stars game is to plan using American Airlines Center’s parking website.

The most economical way to get to American Airlines Center is public transportation. The Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) and Trinity Rail Express (TRE) provide regular service to Victory Station which is located on the west side of American Airlines Center. These two transportation services can get you to the arena from anywhere in the Dallas area including DFW Airport and Fort Worth. In addition to their regular schedule the TRE runs a special event train that leaves Victory Station 20 minutes after the end of the game so you won’t have to miss the ending to catch the train. There is also a location for Uber pick-up on the west side of American Airlines Center while taxis can best be found towards the W Hotel at the corner of Olive Street and N. Houston.

The venue doors open 1 1/2 hours before the puck drops. Once you arrive at American Airlines Center four main entrances provide quick entry into the building. The south side entrance is accessible from Victory Plaza which is where pre-event activities take place while the west side entrance caters to public transportation including Uber taxis and drop-offs. The north and east entrances are primarily used by patrons from the parking garage or those who need the box office; the American Airlines Center box office is located on the northeast corner of the arena.

The concourse inside the arena is well-marked and spacious and you’ll easily notice elevators providing access to the Platinum Club suites and upper-level seating. The stairs inside American Airlines Center are in the corners of the building and provide access between the levels as do the elevators.

Return on Investment 3

American Airlines Center has wonderful sight lines so anywhere in the arena will have a good view of the rink. However Stars tickets aren’t exactly as affordable as going to a Texas Rangers game would be – the Dallas Stars ticket office uses flex pricing which leads to different prices depending on the visiting team day and demand for each game. This flex ticket pricing is a strategy for teams to make more money on popular games and to fill more seats for lower-demand games so weekend games/popular opponents can double the cost of your ticket. However this type of pricing also provides good value for the casual fan during weekday games against non-popular teams; the best way to avoid these price hikes is to become a season ticket holder of some type.

Single game tickets to Dallas Stars games run between $20 and $75 in the Upper Terrace with Lower Bowl tickets ranging from $75 for Plaza Seating to $540 on the glass but it is possible to find more affordable seats when buying from various third parties. As with the rest of the NHL ticket prices for all playoff games will be higher compared to the regular season. That said a night out to a Stars game may seem over the top but compared to the rest of the NHL the Stars are one of the better values.

Extras 4

The American Airlines Center has been the home of the Dallas Stars for almost 2 decades. The venue is one of the best sports venues in America due to the venue’s event operations game day staff and overall maintenance of the facility which help to enhance the experience.

The experience begins as soon as you walk into the concourse and see the trophy case showing the different trophies awarded by the NHL to Dallas Stars players including a replica of the Lord Stanley Cup. Also every Stars' pregame honors the military with a military member being recognized on the ice before the national anthem.

During the game the Stars mascot a furry green alien with hockey sticks for antennae named Victor E. Green walks around the American Airlines Center greeting fans. In addition during breaks in the action the in-game host and national anthem singer Celena Rae oversee fan contests and the Dallas Stars Ice Girls are either clearing the ice during timeouts or dancing on a platform in the lower bowl.

The end zones also have scoreboards that show other statistics continuously such as the number of faceoffs hits and giveaways which enhances the game day atmosphere.

Just as Norwegian's management team opted at the time to retrench back to the airline's core European markets and get rid of its entire Dreamliner fleet others spotted an opportunity.

The new Oslo-based long-haul carrier Norse Atlantic Airways which started flying in June of this year has been rolling out services to several US destinations during the summer. Norse Atlantic is led by Bjorn Tore Larsen and counts among its board members and minority shareholders the former CEO of Norwegian Bjorn Kjos (who stepped down from his executive role at Norwegian back in 2019).

Although not affiliated with Norwegian the new carrier presents many similarities with the latter's now-discontinued long-haul operation. It's not just the practically identical business model but the fact it even took in some of the Boeing 787s that had previously flown for Norwegian just that this time they are painted blue instead of red!

Will Norse atlantic succeed this time where so many others have failed before?

One of the major challenges entrants to the long-haul market face is how to use larger planes without having the same feeder network many legacy airlines rely on. The mostly point-to-point business model the majority of low-cost carriers have is often a limiting factor. Unless fares are significantly lower than other available options most passengers are unwilling to face the risks and inconveniences of using different low-cost flights for connections.

But this is where Norse Atlantic differs. The Oslo-based carrier recently announced an agreement with three different low-cost carriers — one in the U.S. and two in Europe — designed to help feed each other's networks. With this arrangement travelers will now be able to book transatlantic journeys that combine a Norse long-haul flight with short-haul flights either in the U.S. or Europe on Spirit Airlines Easyjet or Norwegian Air all in one go via a dedicated website.

At each of Norse's transatlantic gateways including places like London and New York City passengers will find an array of options for connecting to their final destination. While passengers will still need to pass through customs collect luggage and check in again before their next flight Norse aims to minimize any concerns over missing flights by only offering connections with at least two-and-a-half hours of time between flights.

Is this service helpful?

Despite the potential issues that can come up for passengers with connections Norse Atlantic's new service comes with a key advantage.

Because travelers can book their whole itinerary through the carrier (or alternatively through the Worldwide by Easyjet website where it is also available) they will not be left out in the cold if they miss their connection. Passengers who miss a connection will be rebooked on the next available flight and offered accommodations if their new flight requires an overnight stay.

This customer service component of the experience is provided by Dohop an Icelandic firm that has also developed a software platform that links the booking systems of all the airlines involved in this partnership.

Dohop is also taking care of any issues that arise with customers on behalf of the airlines by communicating with them through various channels including email phone and messenger apps.

What about loyalty programs?

Although Norse Atlantic doesn't have its own loyalty program or any plans to create one soon the carrier's new partnership has created an opportunity for passengers to earn Free Spirit points or Norwegian Reward CashPoints if part of the itinerary is on either airline.

Know though that you won't be able to enter your loyalty program details when you book on Norse's connections site. You'll need to wait until the booking is confirmed and then go to the website of the airline that you want to earn points with to add membership details to your itinerary.

What can travelers expect in the future?

One key question that remains to be answered is what will happen to this arrangement now that JetBlue has announced plans to acquire Spirit. After all Norse's partnership with Spirit almost coincided with JetBlue's acquisition announcement making it natural to wonder what the news will mean for the newly formed arrangement.

However it's simply too early to tell.

Sources at Spirit declined to comment about this particular matter beyond stating that Spirit and JetBlue ""continue to be vigorous competitors and will operate as completely separate companies until the regulatory review process concludes.""

It's a different story on the other side of the Atlantic where Norwegian is recovering from its recent downsizing and catching steam again.

""This agreement is a win-win for both our customers and Norwegian"" said Esben Tuman senior vice president of external communications and public affairs at Norwegian. ""Our customers throughout Europe can now connect to Norse routes across the USA. Likewise inbound customers flying Norse from the USA can now seamlessly connect to the Norwegian network throughout Europe on one ticket.""

Assuming that Norwegian stays in the short-haul market and Norse does the same in the long-haul sector the result could be a situation that closely resembles what the previous iteration of Norwegian used to be just with two separate airlines instead of one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9zb21lb25lLWlzLXNlbGxpbmctY29uY2llcmdla2V5LWNoYWxsZW5nZXMtb24tZWJheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Someone Is Selling ConciergeKey Challenges On eBay,"ConciergeKey is the ‘secret’ status level that American Airlines gives to its top customers and top corporate travel influencers. It became legendary when George Clooney was portrayed as a Concierge Key member on a quest to earn 10 million miles in Up In The Air. The benefits of this status include top priority for upgrades; airport escorts and even occasional vehicle transfers on the tarmac during tight connections; access to Flagship business class lounges; and a next flight guarantee to ensure they get to their destination.

Customers receive this status either because they spend a lot of money with the airline – historically about $60000 on tickets (but not at a low cost per flight) or as a big corporate customer. Corporate contracts may come with a certain number of ConciergeKey memberships. Earning several million AAdvantage miles can now lead to ConciergeKey status too.

American has run ‘challenges’ for Concierge Key membership. A targeted fast track has included four spend levels for American Airlines flights that had to be met during a 90 day period. Different members received different amounts $10000; $12000; $14000 EQDs; $16000. (Those are annual run rates between $40000 and $64000.)

Shockingly someone is selling ConciergeKey status on eBay! They’re asking $2000 and say that there are 10 available.

This is actually for a ConciergeKey challenge offering 3 months of status and keeping the status through the end of the current member year (March 31 2023) for $15000 spend with the airline in those 3 months.

If I wasn’t already a ConciergeKey member I don’t think I would spend $2000 for 3 months of ConciergeKey status as special as it is. I certainly wouldn’t buy this on eBay. American Airlines Corporate Security regularly visits eBay craigslist et al and is liable to ‘purchase’ this in order to identify the seller. And if they do that they might (1) take away the status they’d granted and (2) possibly even lock the account of the person who bought that status. So it seems like a bad idea."

About 2.5 years of work is estimated to be left on the main 500 acre portion where the plant was with razing structures and clearing ash ponds.

Crozier Welding has moved into an old maintenance building on site and other warehouses are available for use now.

Frontier believes the park is an attractive site due to ample power and water and access to road rail and river.

CONESVILLE − An industrial park on the site of the former American Electric Power plant outside of Conesville is coming to fruition with officials already talking to businesses that could move in.

The coal-fired plant closed in May 2020 after 62 years of operation. The Frontier Group of Companies whose core business is Frontier Industrial Corp. took over about 2500 acres that June including the main buildings with plans on razing most structures remediating the coal land and turning the site into the Conesville Industrial Park. They've been doing work since that time including razing three of the large stacks in December. There are also plans to erect a 50-megawatt solar array.

Frontier started in 2001 in Buffalo New York with a primary focus on being an industrial contractor and brownfield developer that decommissions demolishes and re-purposes aging and distressed industrial facilities. Around the time Frontier acquired the Conesville plant they also took on old AEP sites in Cameron and New Haven West Virginia.

Business Development Director Patrick Ford said he's received a lot of questions lately on what's going on with the site and what's next. He attributes this to work on Ohio 16 by the Ohio Department of Transportation detouring traffic through Conesville and past the old plant.

He said they have about two years of remediation work left but where the plant stood should be ready to go in 9 to 15 months. The finished product will look like a modern industrial site with a public access road and utilities like water and sewer.

Development Potential

Ford called it a ""sexy site"" in their portfolio for a variety of reasons related to location and available needs.

""It's a 2500-acre site with ample power and ample water. It's served by rail road and water. It's also in a larger economic market that's very attractive to businesses in energy chemical value added metal transportation logistics and also technology and microchip manufacturing"" Ford said. ""The same assets that are used to make a site attractive for generating power are the same assets that are sexy for industries to want to locate to our site.""

Ford said with Frontier being family owned it's still operated like an old Main Street firm and is concerned about the communities it's in. Working with local officials Ford said they've developed a great relationship with the Coshocton Port Authority and Executive Director Tiffany Swigert among others. Frontier is also working with leadership in Conesville on some projects including creating a park with river access.

""We want to make sure we have our hands on the pulse of the community and not only are we bringing industries and businesses that are a good fit for the community but we also want to capitalize on the labor force in the area"" Ford said. ""One of the things that really attracted us to this site was the rich agrarian and industrial heritage that is the foundation for a great work force. They bring a great work ethic not only to our site but the businesses we're going to bring to our site.""

Swigert said the closure of the plant was very emotional and impactful for the community and not the first time Coshocton was slammed by a major company closure. However this is a crucial moment in Ohio's history when it comes to economic development and some of the projects coming like the Intel chip plant in nearby Licking County. Ford said he recently met Gov. Mike DeWine at a function and he was interested in the Conesville Industrial Park because of it's proximity to the Intel facility.

""It's really important in economic development to figure out what's next and not stay in that moment of sadness but really look toward the future"" Swigert said. ""When we realized what the portfolio was with the Frontier Group of properties we got really optimistic.""

What's Next

The heart of the site with the buildings and ash ponds are being cleaned up to create a large location that could appeal to a major corporation like an Intel. However there are other areas where businesses can move in now and one local firm has already expanded there.

Crozier Welding relocated in 2020 to a larger facility on Ohio 83 adjacent to the Frontier property. Swigert worked with Crozier on the move and in following up with them found they needed even more room based on an expanding customer base. They were able to move into an adjacent old maintenance building. Ford said they have a few warehouses available to be moved into now.

He's working with Swigert on marketing the site meeting with prospective businesses getting permits ready for new businesses to come in and readying necessary infrastructure. He can't reveal any potential companies as nothing is finalized. Swigert said they're receiving several requests for proposals related to interest in the burgeoning industrial park. Park estimated they've met with close to 40 prospective businesses so far.

""We've got a lot of room to accommodate three or four 50-acre industries or one 500-acre industry and a couple 50-acre industries. What's really attractive is that we have road frontage for half the site we have rail along one side and river along the other. We have a lot of flexibility to build a road network to service all the sites and not only accommodate one but multiple industries looking at the site right now"" Ford said.

In the United States outsiders with resources and persistence such as activists and journalists can try to use the legal crowbar of the Freedom of Information Act to pry facts loose. But there is an easier way to look at government secrets and even peruse them at leisure: just be appointed an official government historian. There are hundreds of them working for the various federal agencies in the U.S. salary and benefits decent. Their job is to sift with scholarly thoroughness through raw archival evidence in order to determine how well or badly an agency has carried out its mission. Because these histories are usually published in installments long after the events they describe agencies somehow relax. They permit quasi-independent in-house scholars to poke through their business potentially releasing information that would have brought the agency to its knees if it had been revealed in more timely fashion.

Thomas Wellock formerly a professor at Central Washington University became the historian of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (N.R.C.) more than a decade ago. He brought chops to the job—training in engineering experience testing nuclear reactors and a Ph.D. in history from Berkeley—and in March of 2021 published the sixth in a series of authorized volumes about how the agency and its predecessor the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (A.E.C.) has regulated civilian nuclear power. “Safe Enough? A History of Nuclear Power and Accident Risk” is a refreshingly candid account of how the government from the nineteen-forties onward approached the bottom-line question posed in the book’s title. Technically astute insiders at the A.E.C. took it for granted that “catastrophic accidents” were possible; the key question was: What were the chances? The long and the short of it Wellock’s book suggests is that while many officials believed the chances were very low nobody really knew for sure how low they were or could prove it scientifically. Even as plants were being built the numbers used by officials to describe the likelihood of an accident were based on “expert guesswork or calculations that often produced absurd results” he writes. The “guesswork” nature of such analysis was never candidly acknowledged to either the public or the agency’s licensing boards which had the legal responsibility of determining that individual plants all around the country were safe enough to be approved for operation.

The U.S. nuclear-construction program collapsed decades ago in part because of chronic cost overruns but there are still ninety-two aging nuclear reactors operating in the U.S. and many utility companies want to extend their original forty-year licenses by another twenty years. Around the world more than four hundred reactors are in operation most of them using U.S. designs or similar ones from the sixties and seventies which have documented flaws that are not easily correctable. The nuclear reactors at Fukushima Daiichi Japan for example where meltdowns occurred in 2011 were designed by General Electric; there are thirty-one plants of the same basic G.E. vintage currently operating in the U.S. Wellock discloses internal records describing specific and potentially urgent safety issues still unresolved that pertain directly to many of the nuclear plants operating downwind of major population centers. Some of the foreign operators who rely on U.S. reactor designs may read his book and wonder whether there’s a refund policy.

In recent years as mitigating climate change has become a high priority some energy-policy experts have argued that we should return to building nuclear plants or at least have the federal government sponsor research on new types of reactors with better safety and performance features. In principle nuclear energy remains an appealing technology assuming that the problem of long-term radioactive-waste disposal can be solved. And yet my own studies on reactor safety—which include papers co-authored with the late M.I.T. physicist and Nobel laureate Henry Kendall and several books based on extensive reporting for this magazine—have concluded that nuclear power’s potential contribution to clean energy has been compromised by safety shortcuts taken by the industry and by lax government regulation of day-to-day safety practices at the plants. (I appear in Wellock’s book in part because I served as the executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists—an organization that became “nuclear power’s most effective critic” Wellock writes—from 1972 to 1979.) Studying Wellock’s history which shows what the government got wrong about nuclear power might be helpful in figuring out what the Biden Administration needs to get right if it is to attempt to revive the prospects for nuclear energy. His book also prompts us to ask whether such a revival is desirable given that technologies exist for harnessing the sun and wind which don’t raise daunting safety issues in the first place.

Atoms for Peace the postwar federal nuclear-power program announced by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 aimed to turn swords into plowshares. Nuclear power was presented as the energy source of the future to be delivered at a price “too cheap to meter.” At first it was hard for the program to get off the ground in large part because coal the dominant source for U.S. power production was already cheap and abundant. But a combination of government pressure and loss-leader pricing by nuclear-plant manufacturers led to the creation of a nuclear bandwagon in the nineteen-sixties. (In the seventies an executive with the utility company Florida Power & Light told me that his company had adopted nuclear power so that its leaders wouldn’t be embarrassed on the golf course by other C.E.O.s who had done so.) In the early seventies the A.E.C. predicted that there would be a thousand nuclear reactors operating in the country by 2000—an estimate that would turn out to be off by a thousand percent give or take.

During the Second World War the building of nuclear reactors was exclusively the province of the military. The government Wellock notes thought that it could resolve or at least skirt the technology’s biggest safety issues by building reactors in the desert of Washington State “in the middle of sagebrush and rattlesnakes.” But utility companies keen to avoid constructing expensive long-distance power lines later argued for locating nuclear power plants closer to their customers in urban areas. In the early sixties New York’s Consolidated Edison proposed building a large nuclear plant in Ravenswood Queens—now part of Long Island City—about two miles from Times Square. There were protests including from the former A.E.C. chairman David Lilienthal and the project was nixed. But a nuclear-plant complex remained under development by Con Ed at Indian Point near Croton-on-Hudson some thirty-seven miles away. The A.E.C.’s top advisers questioned whether such reactors could be safely operated so close to metropolitan areas. Wellock cites internal records showing that in a draft letter written in the late sixties the A.E.C.’s principal reactor-safeguards committee warned the agency’s top leadership that unless new emergency cooling technology could be developed future nuclear reactors were “suitable only for rural or remote sites.”

The remote-siting approach not only threatened government ambitions for nuclear power by adding to the costs but was a telltale sign of its inherent dangers; nevertheless the A.E.C. wanted to let plans for building hundreds of large nuclear plants near urban areas move ahead. Wellock finds that the agency’s commissioners intervened to stop the issuance of the letter. (Samuel Jensch who chaired the committee that licensed the Indian Point plant later wrote that licenses for many facilities might have been denied if the government had been forthcoming about its internal concerns; the furnishing of this eye-opening information to the licensing boards he suggested could well have meant the end of commercial nuclear power.) From the sixties onward the A.E.C. used talking points that presented the risks of catastrophic nuclear accidents as “exceedingly low” and “vanishingly small.” Meltdowns—accidents in which the uncontrolled overheating of a reactor’s nuclear fuel creates the potential for the dispersal of radioactive fallout over a large area—were characterized as “incredible events” that for all policymaking purposes could be treated as impossible. A meltdown was supposed to be so unlikely that citizens didn’t have to lose sleep worrying; plant designers similarly were allowed to focus exclusively on preventing lesser mishaps such as temporary cooling-system malfunctions and relieved of the responsibility for building safety systems to try to mitigate accidents in which cooling was lost and could not be restored quickly enough.

For those who are deeply concerned about the safety of nuclear power Wellock’s book paints a disturbing picture. The technical challenge of assuring nuclear safety and of numerically calculating the risk of a bad accident was at the basis of many uncertainties. “A nuclear power plant’s approximately twenty thousand safety components have a Rube Goldberg quality” Wellock writes. “Like dominoes numerous pumps valves and switches must operate in the required sequence to simply pump cooling water or shut down the plant. There were innumerable unlikely combinations of failures that could cause an accident.” And yet even as plants were beginning to be built in larger numbers regulators were realizing that they didn’t have the tools they needed to make reliable safety estimates. If you have substantial data risks can be calculated easily. Insurance companies which pioneered the statistical techniques of risk analysis look at how often accidents of specific types occur under various circumstances. But the nuclear-power industry that emerged in the fifties and sixties was building big plants before it had developed a track record of operating smaller ones. It had no statistics about the safety of the large units it was constructing—novel complex custom-built machines. Stephen Hanauer a senior federal regulatory official at that time who held a Ph.D. in physics summarized this “uncomfortable reality” in numerous internal memos. He duly sent them to other A.E.C. officials often lawyers and political appointees—not scientists—who then filed them away.

Often nuclear plants were designed by firms that had never done the job before and operated by utility companies that had little experience in doing much beyond burning coal and stringing transmission wires. Shrewdly the industry sought to protect itself from the risks it might be imposing on others: it refused to consider building large numbers of plants until 1957 when Congress passed the Price-Anderson Act which effectively granted it blanket protection from paying the full cost of potential liabilities should accidents occur. To make matters even dodgier the emerging nuclear industry operated under a loose regulatory framework. The A.E.C. issued little more than “General Design Criteria” for the industry to follow. The edition of the criteria published in 1965 included a pious edict that “heat removal systems” be provided. But the industry received little guidance on the question of how this difficult feat might be engineered; the agency trusted the industry to figure it out and largely rubber-stamped the designs it proposed. All the while the plants themselves were getting jaw-droppingly big. The first nuclear reactor built in 1942 beneath a football stadium at the University of Chicago had barely been able to power a light bulb—but now the government wanted reactor complexes that could power all of Chicago. As one A.E.C. chairman put it nuclear power was being transformed in just twenty years from the Wright brothers’ Kitty Hawk flyer into a Boeing 747. Depending on your point of view this rambunctious approach was either a laudable alternative to incremental technological advancement or imprudent expensive and reckless.

Although government experts couldn’t nail down the probability of an accident they could use straightforward arithmetic to predict the damage that might result. The results were presented in a 1957 study by the A.E.C.’s Brookhaven National Laboratory. The study which drew on research on the impact of ionizing radiation conducted after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki indicated that a worst-case scenario for a major accident at what was then considered a large nuclear plant could cause thirty-four hundred deaths and seven billion dollars in property damage—about seventy-four billion dollars in today’s money. Eight years later in 1965 Brookhaven updated its analysis of a worst-case scenario. Nuclear plants had grown in scale and the implications were devastating: a meltdown could cause forty-five thousand deaths with radioactive contamination creating a potential “area of disaster the size of the State of Pennsylvania.” When the 1965 update landed at A.E.C. headquarters Wellock writes “The commission opted to suppress the results. For the next eight years the draft update sat like a tumor in remission in A.E.C. filing cabinets waiting to metastasize.” It was made available only in 1973 after the Chicago attorney Myron Cherry demanded its release.

In the gallows humor of the nuclear-engineering community the kind of mishap that could lead to catastrophe was referred to as the China Syndrome: the idea was that a major malfunction could cause a white-hot blob of molten uranium to form and that this blob would begin to sink into the earth heading in the general direction of China. According to Wellock such a scenario became an obsession for the government starting in the late sixties—posing as it did a public-relations problem that could kill the nuclear-power program especially given the rise of the environmental movement. James Schlesinger an economist appointed by President Richard Nixon as the A.E.C. chairman in 1971 worried that the agency—which was then being challenged about the scientific basis of its nuclear-safety claims—lacked satisfactory answers and he supported a major inquiry into accident probability. But the study which was finished in 1975 didn’t put the safety question to rest and for its critics its shortcomings underscored how much the government didn’t know. The N.R.C. was later forced to repudiate its widely publicized findings. According to notes taken by an agency staffer named Thomas Murley and obtained by Wellock there was a debate about letting “the chips fall where they may”—that is releasing whatever results the experts reported. Schlesinger and others urged caution; at one early point he advised staffers working on the report to “keep all references to death injuries or property damage in the vaguest possible terms.”"

Just as Norwegian's management team opted at the time to retrench back to the airline's core European markets and get rid of its entire Dreamliner fleet others spotted an opportunity.

The new Oslo-based long-haul carrier Norse Atlantic Airways which started flying in June of this year has been rolling out services to several US destinations during the summer. Norse Atlantic is led by Bjorn Tore Larsen and counts among its board members and minority shareholders the former CEO of Norwegian Bjorn Kjos (who stepped down from his executive role at Norwegian back in 2019).

Although not affiliated with Norwegian the new carrier presents many similarities with the latter's now-discontinued long-haul operation. It's not just the practically identical business model but the fact it even took in some of the Boeing 787s that had previously flown for Norwegian just that this time they are painted blue instead of red!

Will Norse atlantic succeed this time where so many others have failed before?

One of the major challenges entrants to the long-haul market face is how to use larger planes without having the same feeder network many legacy airlines rely on. The mostly point-to-point business model the majority of low-cost carriers have is often a limiting factor. Unless fares are significantly lower than other available options most passengers are unwilling to face the risks and inconveniences of using different low-cost flights for connections.

But this is where Norse Atlantic differs. The Oslo-based carrier recently announced an agreement with three different low-cost carriers — one in the U.S. and two in Europe — designed to help feed each other's networks. With this arrangement travelers will now be able to book transatlantic journeys that combine a Norse long-haul flight with short-haul flights either in the U.S. or Europe on Spirit Airlines Easyjet or Norwegian Air all in one go via a dedicated website.

At each of Norse's transatlantic gateways including places like London and New York City passengers will find an array of options for connecting to their final destination. While passengers will still need to pass through customs collect luggage and check in again before their next flight Norse aims to minimize any concerns over missing flights by only offering connections with at least two-and-a-half hours of time between flights.

Is this service helpful?

Despite the potential issues that can come up for passengers with connections Norse Atlantic's new service comes with a key advantage.

Because travelers can book their whole itinerary through the carrier (or alternatively through the Worldwide by Easyjet website where it is also available) they will not be left out in the cold if they miss their connection. Passengers who miss a connection will be rebooked on the next available flight and offered accommodations if their new flight requires an overnight stay.

This customer service component of the experience is provided by Dohop an Icelandic firm that has also developed a software platform that links the booking systems of all the airlines involved in this partnership.

Dohop is also taking care of any issues that arise with customers on behalf of the airlines by communicating with them through various channels including email phone and messenger apps.

What about loyalty programs?

Although Norse Atlantic doesn't have its own loyalty program or any plans to create one soon the carrier's new partnership has created an opportunity for passengers to earn Free Spirit points or Norwegian Reward CashPoints if part of the itinerary is on either airline.

Know though that you won't be able to enter your loyalty program details when you book on Norse's connections site. You'll need to wait until the booking is confirmed and then go to the website of the airline that you want to earn points with to add membership details to your itinerary.

What can travelers expect in the future?

One key question that remains to be answered is what will happen to this arrangement now that JetBlue has announced plans to acquire Spirit. After all Norse's partnership with Spirit almost coincided with JetBlue's acquisition announcement making it natural to wonder what the news will mean for the newly formed arrangement.

However it's simply too early to tell.

Sources at Spirit declined to comment about this particular matter beyond stating that Spirit and JetBlue ""continue to be vigorous competitors and will operate as completely separate companies until the regulatory review process concludes.""

It's a different story on the other side of the Atlantic where Norwegian is recovering from its recent downsizing and catching steam again.

""This agreement is a win-win for both our customers and Norwegian"" said Esben Tuman senior vice president of external communications and public affairs at Norwegian. ""Our customers throughout Europe can now connect to Norse routes across the USA. Likewise inbound customers flying Norse from the USA can now seamlessly connect to the Norwegian network throughout Europe on one ticket.""

Assuming that Norwegian stays in the short-haul market and Norse does the same in the long-haul sector the result could be a situation that closely resembles what the previous iteration of Norwegian used to be just with two separate airlines instead of one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMDkvYnVzaW5lc3MvZXVyby1wYWNpZmljLXBldGVyLXNjaGlmZi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter Schiff Has a Deal With Puerto Rico to Liquidate His Euro Pacific Bank He Says (Published 2022),"Peter Schiff the libertarian economist and money manager who has been battling banking regulators in Puerto Rico said Tuesday that he had reached a deal to liquidate his troubled bank.

Mr. Schiff 59 owns Euro Pacific Bank a boutique online bank based in San Juan. In 2020 Euro Pacific found itself at the center of an international investigation into whether it had done due diligence on its account holders. An international group of tax authorities known as the J5 which included the Internal Revenue Service investigated whether the bank had served as a vehicle for suspected tax evasion and money laundering.

In late June bank regulators in Puerto Rico suspended Euro Pacific citing “serious insolvency” issues. H​owever in the settlement reached Tuesday the bank regulators acknowledged the bank did have cash at hand. In that settlement Mr. Schiff agreed to return $66.7 million in deposits selling several million dollars’ worth of the bank’s gold to cover any cash shortfalls. He has also agreed to pay $300000 in fines according to a copy of the settlement.

A spokesman for Puerto Rico’s banking commissioner declined to comment and said the agency would release a statement in the coming days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9jcmlja2V0LWNoYXNlcy10aGUtYW1lcmljYW4tZHJlYW0tODA4NzQxOC_SAWBodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQvY3JpY2tldC1jaGFzZXMtdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWRyZWFtLTgwODc0MTgvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cricket chases the American dream,"In March this year the owners of Major League Cricket (MLC) announced plans to invest around $110 million (approx. Rs 875 crore) to build and renovate eight stadiums in the United States of America. In May Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was announced as a lead investor in a $44 million fundraise by MLC with another $76 million pledged primarily for cricket infrastructure upgrades across the vast country. The Knight Riders group is already among the early stakeholders in the six-team MLC which is planned to begin next year.

The International Cricket Council has been invited to submit a proposal this month for cricket to be considered for inclusion in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics the final decision on which is expected next year at the International Olympic Committee’s session in Mumbai. Also the 2024 T20 World Cup will be co-hosted by the USA along with the West Indies.

Cricket has been making sporadic attempts to crack the massive US sports market for at least the greater part of the past two decades but it is only now with the backing of big names and big money that the chase appears to have picked up some pace.

🚧 WORK HAS BEGUN IN GRAND PRAIRIE TEXAS 🚧 We are excited to announce phase 1️⃣ of the $20M conversion began this week 🏗️ Set to open spring of 2023 our flagship MLC stadium will be the most extensive cricket facility in the USA 🏟️ 🇺🇸 Full story ➡️ https://t.co/SePAhQ4c3e pic.twitter.com/thXCZUd0QO — Major League Cricket (@MLCricket) July 26 2022

With the proposed new renovated as well as repurposed stadiums a significant increase in turf pitches a 26-team Minor League aimed to increase grassroots participation and attempts to woo the average American inside and outside the stadiums cricket hopes to finally make it in the land of its bat-and-ball cousin – baseball.

The main challenge remains daunting – the potential of the overall market is unquestionable but the game itself still isn’t much of a draw in the USA beyond the South Asian and other cricket-connected diaspora of course.

“The US ranks number two in digital consumption of cricket content after India. There’s a huge market maybe made up primarily of the diaspora to start with. The best way to describe the US market is that we’re looking at the number one media market in the world combined with the second-most watched sport… in the medium to long term we must get the average American sports fan interested in T20 cricket or cricket in general” Knight Riders CEO Venky Mysore had told Livemint.

Tom Dunmore vice-president (marketing) at MLC says “The South Asian expat cricket fan is the obvious No. 1 target but we know that in the long-term holistic view of the game here we need to develop new audiences and engage new fans into the sport.

“There is still some perception here that cricket is outdated there is no doubt about that. The biggest barrier is that many people just do not understand the fundamentals of the game the rules how it is played.”

Information and buzz

From setting up explainer kiosks at grounds to tapping social-media influencers cricket is trying to get the message across that it is not some stuck-up quaint British pastime but something that is good enough to compete for eyeballs with popular American sports.

“At the Minor League finals in Morrisville North Carolina we were able to draw a crowd of new fans. We got it out to the media that this is a fun event cricket is maybe not what you think it is it is fast-paced and athletic T20 cricket is shorter than a baseball match come and experience it you love a bat-and-ball game already and the ball is in play a lot here and it is exciting to watch” Dunmore told The Indian Express.

“Young Americans are starting to follow international sport more whether it is soccer rugby or F1 and cricket fits into this diversity as the second-most popular sport in the world. We are starting to see those audiences engage with the game. We are also engaging with YouTube influencers who are big in baseball; Jomboy (James O’Brien) is one of the bigger ones who is embracing cricket.

“It is also about educating people about the sport. We have our Cricket 101 explainer zones at some Minor League matches where fans can get information about how the game is played and the terminology.”

This battle for attention will not be won overnight but cricket does enjoy more visibility on video platforms today than it did a couple of decades ago and that is a boost. “If we can get past some of the barriers such as terminology and get people excited about the sport the stars the action the storylines we will see some success with new audiences” says Dunmore.

Build and upgrade

There is still only one ICC-approved international venue in the USA in Miami where India recently played a couple of T20Is against West Indies. MLC under a strategic partnership agreement with USA Cricket the game’s governing body in the country proposes to build new ones in the greater Los Angeles San Francisco and Seattle metropolitan areas. The existing grounds in Morrisville and Houston will get added facilities and capacity but the ground that’s been envisaged as the ‘home of USA cricket’ is the AirHogs Stadium in Grand Prairie Dallas.

Fittingly it is a baseball ground that is being repurposed into a cricket facility after MLC acquired a long-term lease. It was home to the Texas AirHogs a minor league team that folded during the Covid pandemic.

“The flagship stadium in Grand Prairie will be ready by next year. It is the first time a baseball venue is being converted into a cricket venue. That will certainly be a fantastic option to host World Cup matches. We will also have the upgrading in North Carolina and Houston and then of course the existing venue in Florida which has already hosted high-level international cricket.

“Those four are certainly good options and whether we can get any other venue ready in time for 2024 remains to be seen. It is certainly a tight timeline” says Dunmore on the venues that are likely to host T20 World Cup games.

Mysore has also stated previously that the MLC will likely begin at the existing venues and then expand across the country as new stadiums gradually come up.

“Construction takes time especially when you are working with local governments on the land and development. In both San Jose which is just south of San Francisco and Orange County in the Greater Los Angeles area we have agreements in place to finalise development plans with the local government entities” says Dunmore.

“Right now we are doing our diligence with them and developing our infrastructure plans and by the end of this year we hope to have some progress. The demographics around those areas are very strong for cricket.”

Pitching it right

Apart from fan engagement and stadium facilities a basic requirement for cricket – the pitch – is another challenge. Natural turf surfaces are not just difficult to lay and prepare maintaining them across seasons can be a nightmare given that experienced curators are hard to come across in the USA.

MLC is going for hybrid pitches instead under an arrangement with an Australian company. These are a combination of natural soil and synthetic grass allowing for low upkeep but also maintaining near-usual variation in how the ball behaves after pitching.

“Test match cricket won’t be played on it anytime soon but you can play professional T20 cricket and that is really important for us. It is a vast country so it is hard to instal turf pitches in dozens and dozens of places. Hybrid pitches are much easier to look after once they are installed. It will accelerate our ability to develop the sport.”

Hybrids are proposed to be installed at 20 venues this year across the Bay Area New Jersey Chicago New York City St Louis Michigan Seattle Philadelphia Dallas Orlando Ohio Boston and Atlanta. After several false starts this century cricket seems better prepared to chase the American dream.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS91cGdyYWRlcy1vbi1zcGlyaXQtYWlybGluZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to upgrade your seat on Spirit Airlines,"Unlike most other discount carriers Spirit Airlines has a much more comfortable seat at the front of its planes. And Spirit's marketing of this seat may be the most honest in the travel industry. Dubbed the ""Big Front Seat"" you get what you'd expect: a big seat in the front of the plane. And it's pretty comfy.

You won't get free drinks or free checked bags with the Big Front Seat. And there aren't any free Spirit upgrades to the Big Front Seat even for elite members. But you can buy your way to a nicer seat.

An upgrade to a Big Front Seat isn't as cheap as it used to be but you may still find the cost reasonable. Even if you're traveling on a small budget and want to buy a Spirit upgrade you may find an exit-row seat that's in your price range. Here's what you need to know to give yourself the best chance at an affordable upgrade to more legroom when flying Spirit Airlines.

Buy a Spirit upgrade to the Big Front Seat

There are two ways to get a Spirit upgrade to the Big Front Seat. You can purchase a Big Front Seat assignment outright either during the booking process or after you complete your booking. You can also use Spirit's bidding system to bid on a Big Front Seat which I'll discuss in a subsequent section.

Discount carrier Spirit Airlines charges a fee for just about everything including seat assignments. You'll see a seat map with prices attached to each empty seat during the booking process.

(Screenshot from spirit.com)

Once you select a seat and pay for it you're all set. Spirit advertises a price range of $12 to $250 to select a Big Front Seat. In practice we typically see a range between $50 and $150 with many popular routes charging $100 or more per flight segment for the Big Front Seat.

As a general rule with Spirit seat assignment fees are nonrefundable. So make sure you're very likely to take your trip before committing to an upgrade.

The Free Spirit® Travel More World Elite Mastercard® doesn't offer any discounts or benefits regarding Spirit upgrades. But you can still utilize many other credit card travel credits to cover seat selection fees. For example the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers a $300 annual travel credit and The Platinum Card® from American Express offers an airline fee credit (although you'd need to enroll and select Spirit as your airline of choice before making your purchase).

Buy a Spirit upgrade to the exit row

There are several ways to pay for an upgrade to the exit row. The first similar to the Big Front Seat is to pay for an exit-row seat during seat selection. Spirit lists the price range for paid seat assignments from $1 to $50 (excluding the Big Front Seat). Typically you'll pay $25 to $35 to select an exit-row seat.

The other way to upgrade to an exit-row seat is to purchase one of the bundles Spirit offers during the booking process. Generally speaking you'll be offered two bundles during the booking process. Both the more affordable ""Just For You"" bundle and the pricier ""Bundle It"" bundle include the ability to pick any seat on the plane (excluding a Big Front Seat).

(Screenshot from spirit.com)

For folks who plan to bring a carry-on or checked bag bundle pricing that includes an exit-row seat can provide good value.

Bid on an upgrade to a Big Front Seat or exit-row seat

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Until recently the only way you could grab a Big Front Seat or exit-row seat on Spirit was to purchase it. However Spirit has rolled out a bidding system that may allow you to snag a Spirit upgrade for slightly less cash. TPG's Zach Griff tried bidding on a Big Front Seat and saved 40% on the advertised price.

After you book your flight Spirit has a webpage where you can bid for an upgrade to the exit row or a Big Front Seat. You won't hear whether your bid was successful until within 48 hours of departure (it may be even closer to departure).

Interestingly the terms and conditions of the Spirit bidding system also mention something called ""Instant Level Up."" Instant Level Up is an option where Spirit may offer you the opportunity to purchase an upgraded seat immediately during the bidding process. Spirit's website notes that the Instant Level Up option is only available on select routes.

Get a free Spirit upgrade to exit-row seating with elite status

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

If you fly Spirit frequently and earn elite status with Spirit Airlines you'll enjoy a few perks for your efforts. Don't confuse these perks with status on United or American as you won't find yourself with a free Spirit upgrade to the Big Front Seat. But with enough Spirit flying you may be able to snag a free upgrade to the exit row.

The Free Spirit program has two elevated levels you can earn: Gold and Silver. Free Spirit Silver members have a chance at a free upgrade to an exit row but it'll take a bit of luck. Three hours before departure Free Spirit Silver members can upgrade for free if an exit-row seat is available. Meanwhile Free Spirit Gold members get a much more useful benefit: They can select exit-row seats when booking.

Bottom line

Spirit has options if you want a more comfortable seat but many of them will cost you money. The Big Front Seat is the closest you'll get to a Spirit upgrade and you won't get it for free regardless of whether you carry the Spirit credit card or have elite status in the Free Spirit program.

Now that Spirit has more long-haul flights the comfort of an exit row seat can be worth the extra cash. I'm intrigued by Spirit's bidding system for upgrades to the exit row and Big Front Seat. Maybe when air travel slows down just a bit bidding on an upgrade will be a good way for travelers to save a few bucks on the comfort they crave.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3ByYWN0aWNhbC1wb2ludGVycy1ob3RlbC1hcHAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This tactic often helps me get an early check-in at hotels,"There are lots of ways to get a late checkout at a hotel and plenty of reasons to want one. The ability to sleep in and milk the final hours of a stay or just pass time comfortably before your flight home can really simplify logistics on the final day of your vacation.

Seasoned travelers know all sorts of tricks to help them score extra time in the room before leaving including the fact that Marriott Bonvoy Hilton Honors World of Hyatt and other major hotel loyalty programs include late checkouts as a benefit you earn with elite status.

But what about checking in early?

This can be equally important for some travelers particularly those who arrive at their destination early in the morning. I found myself looking for early check-in just last week when I arrived in London in the morning from an overnight flight.

Some hotel loyalty programs give travelers check-in flexibility as they reach high-level status tiers. For instance IHG One Rewards makes it an explicit benefit for Platinum Elite and Diamond Elite guests (subject to availability). Marriott Bonvoy Ambassador Elite members can take advantage of the ""Your24"" benefit which allows you to pick your check-in and checkout time.

World of Hyatt has a fairly robust system for reserving an early check-in or late checkout at Hyatt Place hotels. Depending on your status it may cost you but it's a pretty good bargain. Members without elite status or with Discoverist status can reserve a 9:00 a.m. check-in for $10. It's a free benefit for Explorist and Globalist members.

Regardless of the hotel brand there are tricks that might get you into your room early. In some cases at no cost. Will each tactic work every time? No. But it's worth a shot.

Try this: Check in on your hotel's app

I've had quite a bit of luck getting into my room early simply by using the mobile check-in feature on a hotel app.

A few years ago I remember arriving at about 7:30 a.m. at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) with a lot of time to kill wishing I could just get into my hotel room early.

I had a reservation at the Marriott Tysons Corner — not a top-tier Marriott Bonvoy property by any stretch but not a budget brand either. Fortunately I had checked in on the app the day before.

I was in my room at Tysons Corner at about 9:00 a.m. (Photo by Sean Cudahy/The Points Guy)

A second later my phone buzzed. My room was ready. It was about 8:00 a.m. and my room for that night was ready for me. It felt like a lucky draw but I've had similar scenarios play out several times since then including twice in the last month.

I recently got this notification my room was ready — and was able to access my mobile key — before I'd even arrived in town. (Screenshot from marriott.com)

None of this cost me anything extra and for many of these stays I had either no status or just Marriott Bonvoy Silver Elite status. (I'm now Gold Elite thanks to recently adding The Platinum Card® from American Express to my wallet).

On each of these occasions I used the mobile check-in feature on the app to alert the hotel I'd be arriving early the hotel had a room ready at the time I noted I would arrive.

Many hotel chains will give you the option of a mobile check-in 24 to 48 hours ahead of your arrival. The app will generally ask you what time you plan to get to the hotel.

With some apps — including the Marriott Bonvoy app — you have quite a bit of latitude to put the earliest time you might arrive. This doesn't mean the hotel will honor your request but you have nothing to lose by putting the time you actually plan to get there.

Again just this past week while driving to Iowa for the Field of Dreams game I marked ""noon"" for my arrival time hoping to get some early afternoon rest in my room after a morning flight. It worked.

(Screenshot from marriott.com)

Now this obviously isn't a foolproof tactic. I've generally had greater success getting into my room early at less in-demand hotels. Are you as likely to be successful getting into your room hours early at the Ritz Carlton Turks and Caicos or the JW Marriott Cancun Resort & Spa? as I was at a hotel in rural Illinois?

Probably not. It's worth a try though.

Set yourself up for a smooth trip: make the request elsewhere too

If getting into your room early is important to you there are some other steps you can take to try and maximize your chances of getting an early check-in.

For one some hotel chains give you the option to make the request when you actually book the stay. At Marriott if you know when booking your room that you'll want to get into your room early you can click ""early check-in.""

(Screenshot from Marriott Bonvoy)

Then note your anticipated arrival time. Again this isn't guaranteeing anything but it can certainly help give the hotel an early heads-up that you'll be wanting to get into your room early. It's all based on availability Marriott says. The company also has a chat feature in its app where you can go in and make requests after booking the stay.

(Screenshot from Marriott Bonvoy)

Using Hilton as another example there isn't a specific ""early check-in"" box when you're booking a room but there is a place where you can write in a ""special request.""

(Screenshot from Hilton)

If all else fails you can try using the app to chat with the hotel to request an early check-in call the front desk or visit the front desk in-person to see if they have a room ready for you ... or if they can accelerate the process of getting one ready. At the very least the front desk can generally secure your belongings so you're not lugging your bags around while waiting for a room.

Bottom line

Some hotels have protocols for getting an early check-in. At many properties your options grow as you earn elite status.

But regardless of status we all find ourselves with a need to get into a hotel room early from time to time. From checking in on your mobile app and marking your arrival time to making use of live chat and special request features to the timeless strategy of asking nicely there are any number of tactics you can try.

The trio of Evan ""M0nkey M00n"" Rogez Alex ""Extra"" Paoli and Enzo ""Seikoo"" Grondein earned the organization’s first world championship and handed G2 another second-place finish at Worlds. Seikoo was named MVP.

For G2 newcomer Massimo ""Atomic"" Franceschi this was his first runner-up finish at the world championship. But for Jacob ""JKnaps"" Knapman and Reed ""Chicago"" Wilen the end of the tournament echoed their second-place finish at Season 7 Worlds in 2019. With the dust settling on this world championship here’s a look back at the most important storylines from the tournament.

Team BDS begin and end the season as champions

For a while it looked like Team BDS had lost their mojo. After starting the RLCS 2021-22 season with a Fall Major championship the European squad exited the Winter and Spring Majors early. But they came back with a vengeance at the RLCS World Championship. Starting in the group stage they beat Oceania’s Renegades 4-1 and North America’s Version1 4-0. Their closest matchup was the quarterfinals in the playoffs where it took BDS seven games to put away an upstart Karmine Corp. In the semifinals they beat FURIA who were riding the high of beating Moist Esports. In the final BDS took care of business in five games against the North American crowd favorites G2 Esports. They’re the only team to win two LANs this season and the only team in RLCS history to win more than one LAN. At this point in time there is no question they are the best Rocket League team in the world.

In a season that saw so much upheaval with teams from South America and the Middle East rising up and challenging the traditional powerhouses from North America and Europe it turned out to be a fairly traditional playoff field at Worlds. Four teams from North America and three teams from Europe reached the playoffs with all three Major champions -- G2 Esports Team BDS and Moist Esports -- among the field of eight. The way the bracket set up it also looked likely to lead to another NA vs. EU final with all four North American teams on one side of the bracket and the three European teams on the opposite side. Once BDS beat FURIA that outcome was guaranteed.

The best team from South America has been gradually improving all season. FURIA broke into the top six at the Winter Major in Los Angeles and followed that up with another top six finish at the Spring Major in London. In between the Major and Worlds they won half a million dollars at the Gamers8 tournament. They ended their season by reaching the semifinals at the RLCS World Championship. It included a win in the quarterfinals over Moist Esports the Spring Major champions and favorites to win the world championship.

The Club the surprise out of wild card stage

Although Worlds played out mostly in favor of the favorites the one underdog that surprised with their performance was The Club. They were one of the most unheralded squads in Texas -- the South American third seed didn’t even get signed ahead of the tournament. Yet they made it out of the wild card stage with wins over Bravado Gaming Pioneers and 01 Esports. The victory over 01 Esports was especially impressive considering they were the second-best team from MENA this year after Team Falcons. Then in the group stage The Club beat Dignitas to set up an all-South American matchup against FURIA. That matchup ended up being closer than expected with FURIA needing seven games to beat The Club. It was a strong performance from an underrated team and another boost to the South American region.

Team Falcons fall short of playoffs

The Spring Major runners-up had the most disappointing results at the world championship. Yes they lost to two very tough teams in FaZe Clan and Karmine Corp but after reaching the final of the last Major they certainly should have made the playoffs. After the year they’ve had it’s a shame Team Falcons didn’t get a chance to make a run on Championship Sunday. Alas they had a season to be proud of in which they put the Middle East on the map as a region to be reckoned with in Rocket League as they challenged and took down teams from NA and EU all season.

Sun Weidong Held a Briefing on Nancy Pelosi's Visit to China's Taiwan Region,"On August 13 2022 Chinese Ambassador to India H.E. Sun Weidong held a round-table briefing on Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to China's Taiwan region. Journalists from Hindustan Times The Times of India The Indian Express The Hindu The Press Trust of India (PTI) Asian News International (ANI) India Writes Xinhua News Agency and China Media Group (CMG) attended the briefing.

Ambassador Sun delivered remarks at the briefing. The full text is as follows:

I am very glad to meet with our media friends and welcome to the Chinese Embassy. This is a good chance for us to interact face to face. It is hoped that the interaction can help all of you to have a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the Taiwan question and China's policy on it.

As known to all the recent situation was raised by Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to China's Taiwan region which is supported by the American government in disregard of China's strong opposition and serious representations. This is a dangerous political provocation which seriously infringed on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity violated the one-China principle and provisions in the three China-US joint communiqués and undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It sent a very wrong signal to “Taiwan independence” separatist forces and the Chinese people expressed strong indignation. It is only natural that China makes a firm response. We are safeguarding our own sovereignty and territorial integrity which is lawful legitimate and justified. The context and events are crystal-clear and the responsibility is fully on the American side and “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. Our actions against Pelosi's visit to Taiwan is not only safeguarding our own sovereignty and territorial integrity but also upholding the international law and the basic norms governing international relations particularly non-interference in countries' internal affairs which is the most important international norm enshrined in the UN Charter.

Ladies and gentlemen let me take this chance to emphasize three points:

First the visit is just a political farce. The US is the culprit of the crisis. The US disregards China's strong opposition and serious representations at various levels went ahead arranging Speaker Pelosi to pay the so-called “visit” to China's Taiwan region. It is elevating its substantive relations with Taiwan. In 1979 the US made a clear commitment in the Sino-US Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations that it recognizes the Government of People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China and acknowledges Taiwan is part of China. We can see that the one-China principle is the pretext and basis for China and the US to develop diplomatic relations. However in recent years we can see that the US has claimed it is committed to the one-China policy but action-wise it has been backtracking. The US has inserted into its characterization of the one-China policy the so-called “Taiwan Relations Act” and the “Six assurances” which were unilaterally concocted and have never been recognized and have been firmly opposed to by China. It has also constantly elevated its substantive relations with Taiwan region colluded with the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces has steadily increased arms sales to Taiwan helped the latter develop so-called “asymmetric capabilities” and encouraged Taiwan preventing reunification by force. The US assembles its allies to send military aircraft and warships to come to the adjacent waters of China flexing muscles and stirring up troubles. They conduct up to a hundred military exercises each year. Who is stirring up the trouble and who is escalating the situation? Everybody has clear judgement.

We must be vigilant that the US unwilling to accept defeat might gang up with others to fan the flames and add oil to the fire beef up military deployment in the region and further escalate the situation in an attempt to create a new and even bigger crisis. We urge the US side to examine themselves honestly stop such behaviours immediately stop confounding black and white stop creating rumors to mislead the masses stop meddling in Taiwan affairs and China's domestic affairs stop supporting or conniving at “Taiwan independence” separatist forces in any form. The US should return to the right track of the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués at an early date.

Second Taiwan belongs to China since ancient times and has never been a country. Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China. This has been the status quo of Taiwan since ancient times. I would like to make a brief introduction of Taiwan question. In 1895 Japan forced the Qing government to cede Taiwan after Japan's war of aggression against China. In 1943 the Cairo Declaration clearly stipulated that all the territories Japan had stolen from China including Taiwan should be restored to China. The Potsdam Proclamation of 1945 reiterated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out. In 1945 the Chinese government announced that it was resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan and China had recovered Taiwan de jure and de facto. In 1949 the People's Republic of China was founded becoming the successor to the Republic of China and the Central People's Government became the sole legal government of the whole of China. The new government replaced the previous KMT regime in a situation where China as a subject of international law did not change and China's sovereignty and territory did not change. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have fallen into a state of protracted political confrontation. But the sovereignty and territory of China have never been divided and will never be divided and Taiwan's status as part of China's territory has never changed and will never be allowed to change.

It is not China but the US and “Taiwan independence” separatist forces who change the status quo across the Strait. In the past years the DPP authorities in Taiwan have tried to seek the American support for independence refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus. They pushed forward the “incremental independence” promoted “de-sinicization” deceived the people of Taiwan and incited hostility against the mainland. They have tried to collude with external forces and sowed the seeds of “two Chinas” or “one China one Taiwan” on different occasions. These actions seeking the so-called “Taiwan independence” cause the tension across the Strait and jeopardize peace and stability in this region. Facing such flagrant separatist actions which country can tolerate that? Which country can let the separatist forces do what they want?

Taiwan question is the core of China's core interests. The position of the Chinese Government and people on the Taiwan question has been consistent. To realize the complete reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration and sacred obligation of all Chinese people. The Chinese people will decide our own affairs. We strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and efforts but we will not renounce the use of force and we reserve the option of taking all necessary measures. These measures are against those external forces' interference and against separatist actions of the few “Taiwan independence” forces. We warn the DPP authorities in Taiwan that attempts to reject reunification and split the country are doomed because they will founder against the history and culture of the Chinese nation as well as the resolve and commitment of more than 1.4 billion Chinese people. They should not misjudge the situation and overestimate their abilities and should stop going even further down the path of splitting the country and the nation stop plunging Taiwan into the abyss that brings nothing but disaster to the compatriots in Taiwan.

Third facing the reckless moves of the US side and the Taiwan DPP authorities the Chinese side has no choice but to fight back. We announced sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family members and conducted military exercises. These are aimed at sending a warning to the ones who caused the crisis and those who violated our rights. These are also practical actions to uphold the international law and the basic norms governing international relations particularly non-interference in countries' internal affairs which is the most important international norm enshrined in the UN Charter. The measures taken by the Chinese side are justified proportionate open and transparent. It is entirely within China's sovereignty and in line with China's domestic law international law and established international practices. The socalled “overreaction” used by the US is completely confounding black and white which cannot change the fact that the US is the biggest destroyer of regional peace the biggest troublemaker of regional stability and the biggest threat to regional development.

An unjust cause finds little support. The typical U.S. playbook is to create a problem first and then use that problem to achieve its own objective. It is a typical example of deflecting the blame. Since the end of the Second World War the US has stoked hundreds of armed conflicts leading to political turmoil innocent people's tragedies and sufferings in many countries. Tens of thousands of people have died because of that while millions of people got displaced from home. Can we just let the US unscrupulously push forward hegemony? Can we just endure that the US bullies other countries with its so-called “a position of strength”? If the Chinese side doesn't firmly resist Pelosi's visit to Taiwan region they will double down and continuously pursue the dangerous path，and damage the regional peace and stability at last. The attempt of challenging the one-China principle is indeed challenging the international order after the Second World War challenging the common consensus of international community challenging the principles of international laws and basic norms in international relations. If the US is allowed to do what it wants the UN Charter will be just a sheet of paper and the law of the jungle will prevail which will make the developing countries especially small and medium-sized countries to suffer.

A just cause rallies abundant support. The majority of the international community have expressed understanding and support to China. More than 170 countries and many international organizations have reiterated their commitment to the one-China principle which is the overwhelming international consensus. Many parties around the world have also spoken out in support of China. The Chinese people are not to be misled by fallacies or scared by evils. China will not hesitate to fight back each time the US makes a serious provocation that violates China's sovereignty and interferes in China's internal affairs. We will never allow our sovereignty and territorial integrity to be trampled and sabotaged. We urge some political figures of certain countries not to ignore right and wrong or jump on the bandwagon of hyping up the matter. They should not attempt to copy this political stunt to serve their political self-interests should not attempt to play the so-called “Taiwan card” or to embolden the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces.

The Taiwan question arose when the country was weak and chaotic at the time and will surely end with national rejuvenation. Embarking on a new journey in a new era the CPC and the Chinese government will continue to rally compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and lead the efforts to answer the call of the times shoulder historic responsibilities grasp our fate and future in our own hands and work hard to achieve national reunification and rejuvenation.

China and India are important neighbors to each other. The two peoples sympathized with and helped each other cordially in the process of fighting for national independence and liberation. On the occasion to celebrate 75th anniversary of India's Independence I would like to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and those sages and leaders of India for their contributions and endless efforts to seek for independence. After the founding of the People's Republic of China and India's Independence both countries adhere to independence seek for the path that most suitable to its own national conditions and achieve new progresses in the journey of pursing national prosperity. China and India jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and advocate upholding sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The one-China principle is the political foundation of the China-India relations. We have released a series of political documents stating that， “The Indian side recalled that India was among the first countries to recognize that there is one China and its one China policy remains unaltered. The Indian side stated it would continue to abide by its one China policy.” In 1971 India voted to support the People's Republic of China to restore its lawful seat in the United Nations. The Chinese side appreciates the position of the Indian side above.

It is hoped that the Indian side can adhere to independent foreign policy understand and support China's justified position and its efforts to defend sovereignty security and development interests and honor the one-China principle. It is also hoped that our Indian media friends could be aware of the instigation by “Taiwan independence” separatist forces hold an objective rational and independent position in reporting Taiwan-related stories and follow the one-China principle commitment made by the Indian government so as to avoid being misled by anti-China forces and ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces.

The Chinese government has officially released a white paper titled The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era. The white paper gives a comprehensive overview of the history policies and propositions on the Taiwan question with the aim to set the record straight and send the most authoritative message to the world. We are ready to work with friends from all countries who love peace and uphold justice to resolutely reject all words and deeds that interfere in China's internal affairs firmly resist all adventurist moves that jeopardize peace across the Taiwan Strait and jointly safeguard the one-China principle defend the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and maintain regional stability and world peace.

In his interaction with the journalists Ambassador Sun said we hope that all countries could uphold an objective and fair position grasp the vicious political intention behind Pelosi's visit and the serious harms of the “Taiwan independence” separatist force understand and support China's efforts to defend its sovereignty security and development interests abide by the one-China principle. The one-China principle is the political foundation of China-India relations. This is also the fundamental premise for China to develop relations with other countries including India. We hope that the Indian side could openly reiterate its one-China policy like many other countries.

During the briefing Ambassador Sun also had candid and in-depth exchanges with the journalists on China-India relations border situation and bilateral economic and trade cooperation. The Chinese Embassy provided white paper titled ""The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era"" to all the journalists.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbGx1cC5jb20vd29ya3BsYWNlLzIzNjM2Ni9yaWdodC1jdWx0dXJlLW5vdC1lbXBsb3llZS1zYXRpc2ZhY3Rpb24uYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Employee Engagement vs. Employee Satisfaction and Organizational Culture,"Story Highlights Measuring workers' contentment doesn't improve business outcomes

Approaching engagement strategies as business strategies yield better results

Highly engaged organizations share common philosophies and practices

Creating a great workplace culture that has star employees who know how to win new customers isn't about making employees happy or content -- and organizations falter when they think it is.

It's true that enthusiastic and energetic employees feel better about their work and workplace. But engagement is not determined by an abstract feeling. Measuring workers' contentment or happiness levels as well as catering to their wants often fails to achieve the underlying goal of employee engagement: improved business outcomes.

Organizations have more success with engagement and improve business performance when they treat employees as stakeholders of their own future and the company's future. This means focusing on concrete performance management activities such as clarifying work expectations getting people what they need to do their work providing development and promoting positive coworker relationships.

The majority of the U.S. workforce (65%) is not engaged according to Gallup's State of the Global Workplace: 2022 Report. These employees are indifferent and neither like nor dislike their job. They represent a risk and that risk can tilt either way -- good or bad.

###Embeddable###

Many employees who are not engaged want a reason to be inspired. They are the ""show me"" group that needs an extra push to perform at their best. While positive feelings such as happiness are usually byproducts of engagement they shouldn't be confused with the primary outcomes. Rather the primary emphasis should be on elements that engage workers and drive results such as clarity of expectations the opportunity to do what they do best development and opinions counting.

Employee Engagement Strategies Are Good for Business

Approaching engagement as a business strategy yields clear and better results. Gallup recently conducted the 10th version of our meta-analysis (a study of studies) to determine the relationship of engagement -- as measured by Gallup's employee engagement survey -- to business-/work-unit profitability productivity employee retention and customer perception.

Despite massive changes in the economy and technology the results of the most recent meta-analysis are consistent with the results of each previous version. Simply put engaged employees produce better business outcomes than other employees do -- across industries company sizes and nationalities and in good economic times and bad.

Business or work units that score in the top quartile of their organization in employee engagement more than double their odds of success (based on a composite of financial customer retention safety quality shrinkage and absenteeism metrics) when compared with those in the bottom quartile. Those at the 99th percentile have nearly five times the success rate of those at the first percentile.

When compared with business units in the bottom quartile of engagement those in the top quartile realize improvements in the following areas among others:

Showing up and staying: Engaged employees make it a point to show up to work and do more work -- highly engaged business units realize an 81% difference in absenteeism and a 14% difference in productivity. Engaged workers also are more likely to stay with their employers. In high-turnover organizations highly engaged business units achieve an 18% difference in turnover. In low-turnover organizations the gains are even more dramatic: Highly engaged business units achieve a 43% difference in turnover. High-turnover organizations are those with more than 40% annualized turnover and low-turnover organizations are those with 40% or lower annualized turnover.

Customer outcomes: Employees who are engaged consistently show up to work and have a greater commitment to quality and safety. Understandably these employees also help their organizations improve customer relationships and obtain impressive organic growth. Highly engaged business units achieve a 10% difference in customer ratings and an 18% difference in sales.

Profit: The previous outcomes collide to bring organizations increased profitability. Engaged employees are more present and productive; they are more attuned to the needs of customers; and they are more observant of processes standards and systems. When taken together the behaviors of highly engaged business units result in a 23% difference in profitability.

Creating the Right Organizational Culture Is Possible

Employee engagement has long been a concern in the U.S. workforce but -- perhaps now more than ever -- it represents a vital component of employee attraction and retention. For the modern workforce an engaging work environment is a fundamental expectation a baseline requirement. Many employees refuse to settle for an organization that does not strategically prioritize engagement. For leaders this means a culture of engagement is no longer an option -- it is an urgent need.

Creating a culture of engagement requires more than completing an annual employee survey and then leaving managers on their own hoping they will learn something from the survey results that will change the way they manage. It requires an organization to take a close look at how critical engagement elements align with their performance development and human capital strategies.

Engaging employees takes work and commitment but it is not impossible. Just about one-third of the overall U.S. workforce is engaged. And many organizations come to Gallup with even lower percentages of engaged employees -- the median engagement level among our first-year clients is 41%.

But as they shift their approach these organizations begin to realize improvements in performance. The engagement level among recent Gallup clients is 48% and it is even higher among clients with the highest levels of engagement -- the winners of the Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award. In these organizations an average of 70% of employees are engaged and there are 14 engaged employees for every actively disengaged employee -- a ratio that is 6.6 times the national average.

Highly engaged organizations share common philosophies and practices. Among other things:

They know creating a culture of engagement starts at the top.

Their leaders are aligned in prioritizing engagement as a competitive strategic point of differentiation.

They communicate openly and consistently.

They place the utmost importance on using the right metrics and on hiring and developing great managers.

Highly engaged organizations also hold their managers accountable -- not just for their team's measured engagement level but also for how it relates to their team's overall performance. They ensure that managers are engaging employees from the first minute of their first day at work.

These organizations have well-defined and comprehensive development programs for leaders and managers and they focus on the development of individuals and teams. Employee engagement is a fundamental consideration in their people strategy not an annual ""check-the-box"" activity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMDkvYnVzaW5lc3MvZXVyby1wYWNpZmljLXBldGVyLXNjaGlmZi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter Schiff Has a Deal With Puerto Rico to Liquidate His Euro Pacific Bank He Says (Published 2022),"Peter Schiff the libertarian economist and money manager who has been battling banking regulators in Puerto Rico said Tuesday that he had reached a deal to liquidate his troubled bank.

Mr. Schiff 59 owns Euro Pacific Bank a boutique online bank based in San Juan. In 2020 Euro Pacific found itself at the center of an international investigation into whether it had done due diligence on its account holders. An international group of tax authorities known as the J5 which included the Internal Revenue Service investigated whether the bank had served as a vehicle for suspected tax evasion and money laundering.

In late June bank regulators in Puerto Rico suspended Euro Pacific citing “serious insolvency” issues. H​owever in the settlement reached Tuesday the bank regulators acknowledged the bank did have cash at hand. In that settlement Mr. Schiff agreed to return $66.7 million in deposits selling several million dollars’ worth of the bank’s gold to cover any cash shortfalls.

The raid was just the most recent episode in which the former American leader was accused of playing loose with and abusing classified information.

Iranian missile site

As president Trump had the power to unilaterally declassify information. But some of his actions stunned the US intelligence community nonetheless.

On August 30 2019 he tweeted what was believed to be a classified high-resolution image of an Iranian rocket launch site.

“The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir [Space Launch Vehicle] Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran” Trump said.

Israeli intelligence

On May 10 2017 Trump met Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the White House Oval Office.

In the meeting Trump told the two Russians about intelligence the United States had received from a Middle East ally about an Islamic State plot.

The highly classified intelligence it turned out came from Israel which was upset by the disclosure according to foreign media reports.

Location of nuclear subs

In April 2017 Trump told Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte that two US nuclear submarines were off the coast of North Korea boasting of “a lot of firepower” according to a Philippines transcript of their call.

The Pentagon only very rarely discloses the location of its submarines which are crucial to the US strategic defense force.

Secret nuclear weapons

In a 2019 interview Trump told writer Bob Woodward about an unknown US nuclear capability that may have been a specious boast or divulged highly secret information.

“I have built a nuclear a weapons system that nobody’s ever had in this country before” Trump told Woodward.

“We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before” he added.

Details of Special Forces raid

After a US operation killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria in October 2019 Trump boasting of the attack revealed numerous details that the Pentagon would normally withhold like how many helicopters were involved how the commandos entered the residence and that the US had intelligence from Islamic State use of phones and internet.

The information “could contribute to a reverse engineering of our intelligence methods by the adversary” former special operations commander Michael Nagata told Politico.

Secrecy with Putin

Trump also withheld intelligence from his spy chiefs. In July 2018 Dan Coats the director of national intelligence was visibly surprised at the Aspen Security Forum when the host told him the White House had tweeted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to visit Washington.

“Say that again?” Coats said.

A year later Coats said he was in the dark about what Trump discussed in a two-hour one-on-one meeting with the wily Russian leader three days earlier.

“I don’t know what happened in that meeting” Coats said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9lc3BvcnRzL3BsYXllcnMtZGVsZXRlLWNoYXJhY3RlcnMtdG93ZXItZmFudGFzedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Players can't delete their characters in Tower of Fantasy,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/players-delete-characters-tower-fantasy on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9lc3BvcnRzL3BsYXllcnMtZGVsZXRlLWNoYXJhY3RlcnMtdG93ZXItZmFudGFzedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ2FtZWd1aWRlcy5jb20vdG93ZXItb2YtZmFudGFzeS90b3dlci1vZi1mYW50YXN5LXVuYWJsZS10by1jb25uZWN0LXRvLXRoZS1zZXJ2ZXItaG93LXRvLWZpeC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Tower of Fantasy ""Unable to connect to the server"" How To Fix","Tower of Fantasy has its share of problems when it comes to game servers. The launch didn't go that smoothly as over four million pre-registered players attempted to log in the second the game went live. Although developers have expected issues they were unable to prevent them. You can try a few methods if you still get an ""unable to connect to server"" message when you try to log in.

How to solve the ""Unable to connect to server"" issue in ToF

If you often get ""unable to connect to server"" that usually means that server is full. Servers are divided by regions (continents) where every region has available servers for you to choose from. Red servers are the busy ones yellow is half full and green one delivers a smooth gaming experience. If your server is red you can try these solutions:

Screenshot by Pro Game Guides

1. Evade rush hours in Tower of Fantasy

If your server is always full when you want to play avoid evenings when most players are online.

2. Switch server in Tower of Fantasy

Within your region (for example North America) you can switch to another server that is not that hot.

3. Change a region in Tower of Fantasy

If that doesn't work change a region. That means you'll be playing Tower of Fantasy with players from that region (continent). Choose a region where the time difference is significant so the servers are not overcrowded.

Sometimes you'll have a problem connecting if you don't have the latest update installed. Also sometimes servers will be down due to maintenance.

Will there be a server merge in Tower of Fantasy?

One of the most common complaints by players is a large number of servers instead of just one. Because of this some players had problems playing with friends in Tower of Fantasy as they are in the same region but on different servers. Hence many believe that all servers from one region will merge into one. There is no information about this happening soon but it does seem like a next step.

Experts weigh in on idea of sending Mississippi River water to West,"Two hundred miles north of New Orleans in the heart of swampy Cajun country the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1963 cut a rogue arm of the Mississippi River in half with giant levees to keep the main river intact and flowing to the Gulf of Mexico.

The Old River Control Structure as it was dubbed is also the linchpin of massive but delicate locks and pulsed flows that feed the largest bottomland hardwood forests and wetlands in the United States outstripping the better-known Okefenokee Swamp that straddles Georgia and Florida.

Clouds of birds — hundreds of species — live in or travel through Louisiana’s rich Atchafalaya forests each year said National Audubon Society Delta Conservation Director Erik Johnson. They include gawky pink roseate spoonbills tiny bright yellow warblers known as swamp candles because of their bright glow in the humid green woods and more.

This summer as seven states and Mexico push to meet a Tuesday deadline to agree on plans to shore up the Colorado River and its shriveling reservoirs retired engineer Don Siefkes of San Leandro California wrote a letter to The Desert Sun with what he said was a solution to the West's water woes: build an aqueduct from the Old River Control Structure to Lake Powell 1489 miles west to refill the Colorado River system with Mississippi River water.

“Citizens of Louisiana and Mississippi south of the Old River Control Structure don’t need all that water. All it does is cause flooding and massive tax expenditures to repair and strengthen dikes” wrote Siefkes.”New Orleans has a problem with that much water anyway so let’s divert 250000 gallons/second to Lake Powell which currently has a shortage of 5.5 trillion gallons. This would take 254 days to fill.”

The letter and others with an array of ideas generated huge interest from readers around the country — and debate about whether the concepts are technically feasible politically possible or environmentally wise. Seeking answers The Desert Sun consulted water experts conservation groups and government officials for their assessments.

Engineers said the pipeline idea is technically feasible. But water experts said it would likely take at least 30 years to clear legal hurdles to such a plan. And biologists and environmental attorneys said New Orleans and the Louisiana coast along with the interior swamplands need every drop of muddy Mississippi water.

The massive river with tributaries from Montana to Ohio is a national artery for shipping goods out to sea. And contrary to Siefkes' claims experts said the silty river flows provide sediment critical to shore up the rapidly disappearing Louisiana coast and barrier islands chewed to bits by hurricanes and sea rise. Scientists estimate a football field's worth of Louisiana coast is lost every 60 to 90 minutes. Major projects to restore the coast and save brown pelicans and other endangered species are now underway and Mississippi sediment delivery is at the heart of them.

Siphon off a big portion and “you’d be swapping one ecological catastrophe for another” said Audubon’s Johnson.

Read it on Reddit

Nonetheless Siefkes’ trans-basin pipeline proposal went viral receiving nearly half a million views. It’s one of dozens of letters the paper has received proposing or vehemently opposing schemes to fix the crashing Colorado River system which provides water to nearly 40 million people and farms in seven western states.

Fueled by Google and other search engines more than 3.2 million people have read the letters an unprecedented number for the regional publication's opinion content.

Many saw Siefkes' idea and others like it as sheer theft by a region that needs to fix its own woes.

“Let's be really clear here. As a resident of Wisconsin a state that borders the (Mississippi) river let me say: This is never gonna happen” wrote Margaret Melville of Cedarburg Wisconsin. “What states in the Southwest have failed to do is curtail growth and agriculture that is of course water-driven.""

But desert defenders pushed back. John Neely of Palm Desert responded: ""All of these river cities who refuse to give us their water can stop snowbirding to the desert to use our water. The snowbirds commonly stay here for at least six months. Do they thank us for using our water? No. Do they pay extra for using our water? No. They’re all such hypocrites. My water your water. My state your state. Last time I heard we are still the United States of America.""

Haul icebergs south? Manufacture rain?

Yahoo Reddit and ceaseless headlines about a 22-year megadrought and killer flash floods not to mention dead bodies showing up on Lake Mead’s newly exposed shoreline have galvanized reader interest this summer.

But grand ideas for guaranteeing water for the arid West have been floated for decades. Haul icebergs from the Arctic to a new southern California port. Run a giant hose from the Columbia River along the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to refill Diamond Valley Reservoir. Grab hydrogen and oxygen from the air and make artificial rain.

As zany as the ideas may sound could any work and if so what would be the costs?

Experts say there’s a proverbial snowball’s chance in August of most of these schemes being implemented. Physically some could be achieved. This is the country that built the Hoover Dam and where Los Angeles suburbs were created by taking water from Owens Lake. From winter lettuce in grocery stores to the golf courses of the Sun Belt the West’s explosive growth over the past century rests on aqueducts canals and drainage systems.

The bigger obstacles are fiscal legal environmental and most of all political.

""The engineering is feasible. Absolutely. You could build a pipeline from the Mississippi or Missouri Rivers. Would it be expensive? Yes. Do we have the political will? Absolutely not"" said Meena Westford executive director of Colorado River resource policy for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. ""I think that societally we want to be more flexible. We want to have more sustainable infrastructure. So moving water that far away to supplement the Colorado River I don't think is viable. But it's doable. You could do it.""

In fact she and others noted many such ideas have been studied since the 1940s. Most recently in 2012 the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation produced a report laying out a potentially grim future for the Colorado River and had experts evaluate 14 big ideas commonly touted as potential solutions.

The concepts fell into a few large categories: pipe Mississippi or Missouri River water to the eastern side of the Rockies or to Lake Powell on the Arizona-Utah border bring icebergs in bags on container ships or via trucks to Southern California pump water from the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest to California via a subterranean pipeline on the floor of the Pacific Ocean or replenish the headwaters of the Green River the main stem of the Colorado River with water from tributaries.

While they didn’t outright reject the concepts the experts laid out multi-billion-dollar price tags including ever-higher fuel and power costs to pump water up mountains or over other geographic obstacles. They also concluded environmental and permitting reviews would take decades.

""To my mind the overriding fatal flaw for large import schemes is the time required to become operational. A multi-state pipeline could easily require decades before it delivers a drop of water"" said Michael Cohen senior researcher with the Pacific Institute. He said the most pragmatic approach would only pump Midwest water to the metro Denver area to substitute for imports to the Front Range on the east side of the Rockies avoiding ""staggering"" costs to pump water over the Continental Divide.

But Denver officials have expressed skepticism because Missouri or Mississippi water is of inferior quality to pure mountain water.

The biggest of them all

Not mentioned was the great grand-daddy of all schemes for re-allocating water known as the North American Water and Power Authority Plan. Developed in 1964 by engineer Ralph Parsons and his Pasadena-based Parsons Corporation the plan would provide 75 million acre-feet of water to arid areas in Canada the United States and Mexico. An acre-foot is enough water to serve about two households for a year so it could supply water to 150 million customers.

The total projected cost of the plan in 1975 was $100 billion — or nearly $570 billion in today's dollars comparable to the Interstate Highway System. The project would require more than 300 new dams canals pipelines tunnels and pumping stations. Its largest dam would be 1700 feet tall more than twice the height of Hoover Dam.

Parsons said the plan would replenish the upper Missouri and Mississippi Rivers during dry spells increase hydropower along the Columbia River and stabilize the Great Lakes. He proposed using nuclear explosions to excavate the system's trenches and underground water storage reservoirs.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prodded by members of Congress from western states studied the massive proposal. Ultimately the rising environmental movement squelched it — the project would destroy vast wildlife habitats in Canada and the American West submerge wild rivers in Idaho and Montana and require the relocation of hundreds of thousands of people.

Environmental writer Marc Reisner said the plan was one of ""brutal magnificence"" and ""unprecedented destructiveness."" Historian Ted Steinberg said it summed up ""the sheer arrogance and imperial ambitions of the modern hydraulic West.""

But the idea has never completely died. In 1982 efforts were made to revive the plan by a Parsons company engineer and the Lyndon Larouche movement supported it as recently as 2010.

In China the massive South-to-North Water Diversion Project is the largest such project ever undertaken. Inspired by Mao Zedong who in 1952 observed ""The south has plenty of water and the north lacks it so if possible why not borrow some?"" and planned for completion in 2050 it will divert 44.8 billion cubic meters of water annually to major cities and agricultural and industrial centers in the parched north.

When finished the $62 billion project will link China’s four main rivers and requires construction of three lengthy diversion routes one using as its base the 1100-mile long Hangzhou-to-Beijing canal which dates from the 7th century AD.

Meanwhile watershed states in the U.S. and even counties have taken action to prevent such schemes.

The Great Lakes Compact signed by President George W. Bush in 2008 bans large water exports outside of the area without the approval of all eight states bordering them and input from Ontario and Quebec.

Other legal constraints include the Endangered Species Act the National Environmental Protection Act and various state environmental laws said Brent Newman senior policy director for the National Audubon Society's Delta state programs. A Mississippi pipeline to Lake Powell would need to cut across four states he and Johnson said including hundreds of miles of wetlands in Louisiana and west Texas.

Large amounts of fossil fuel energy needed to pump water over the Rockies would increase the very climate change that’s exacerbating the 1200-year drought afflicting the Colorado River in the first place said Newman who in his previous job helped the state of Colorado design a long-term water conservation plan. At comment sessions on Colorado's plan he said long-distance pipelines were constantly suggested by the public.

""Sometimes there is a propensity in areas like Louisiana or the Southwest where we've had such success in our engineering marvels to engineer our way out of everything"" Newman said. ""I don't think that drought especially in the era of climate change is something we can engineer our way out of.""

Arizona oceanfront

But big water infrastructure projects aren't just of interest to the general public. Arizona which holds ""junior"" rights to Colorado River water meaning it has already been forced to make cuts and might be legally required to make far larger reductions wants to build a bi-national desalination plant at the Sea of Cortez which separates Baja California from the Mexican mainland. The resulting fresh water would be piped north to the thirsty state.

Such major infrastructure “is an absolute necessity” said Tom Buschatzke director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources who said he “represents the governor on all things Colorado River.”

Arizona's legislature allocated $1 billion in its last session for water augmentation projects like a possible desalination plant and state officials are in discussions with Mexican officials about the idea said Buschatzke.

The state also set aside funds in 2018 to study possible imports from the Missouri or Mississippi Rivers but to date the study hasn’t been done he said.

Others said the costs of an Arizona-Mexico desalination plant would also likely prove infeasible.

""The desalination plant Arizona has scoped out would be by far the largest ever in North America"" said Jennifer Pitt National Audubon Society's Colorado River program director. Pitt who was a technical adviser on Reclamation's 2012 report decried ceaseless pipeline proposals. ""Nebraska wants to build a canal to pull water from the South Platte River in Colorado and downstream Colorado wants to take water from the Missouri River and pull it back across Nebraska. It boggles the mind. I can't even imagine what it would all cost.""

Westford of Southern California's Metropolitan Water District agreed. ""Arizona really really wants oceanfront"" she chuckled. ""Mexico has said it didn't ... although there has been a recent change in government.""

But Westford and her colleague Brad Coffey water resources manager said desalination is needed in the Golden State. Despite the recent defeat of a major plant in Huntington Beach after the California Coastal Commission said it was too environmentally damaging ""ocean desalination can't be off the table"" said Coffey.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom also touted desalination in a drought resilience plan he announced last week though in brackish inland areas. All three officials said the construction of a 45-mile Delta Water Project tunnel to keep supply flowing from the middle of the state to thirsty cities in the south is vital. That project which also faces heavy headwinds from environmentalists would cost an estimated $12 billion.

Coffey said the project isn't really a pipeline but more ""a bypass for ... an aging 60-year-old"" system.

Official no comments

Asked about a Mississippi River pipeline or other new infrastructure to rescue the Colorado River federal and state officials declined to respond or said there was no realistic chance such a major infrastructure project is in the offing.

California Department of Water Resources spokeswoman Maggie Macias in an email: “In considering the feasibility of a multi-state water conveyance infrastructure the extraordinary costs that would be involved in planning designing permitting constructing and then maintaining and operating such a vast system of infrastructure would be significant obstacles when compared to the water supply benefits and flood water reduction benefits that it would provide. ... Instead California is focused on better managing the water we have improving forecasting and making our groundwater basins more sustainable.”

The agency is moving forward with smaller projects across the state to reduce seismic and hydrologic risks like eliminating leaks or seepage including at four existing dams and related spillways in Riverside and Los Angeles counties.

Asked what might be the requirements and constraints of a pipeline from the Mississippi River to the Colorado River U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Gene Pawlik said “Since (the Army Corps) has not done a formal study related to the use of pipelines to move water between watersheds we cannot speculate on the details or cost of such projects.”

But pipelines and other big ideas will always attract interest hydrology experts said because they falsely promise an innovative easy way out.

“I have dystopian nightmares about pipelines marching across the landscape” said global water scarcity expert Jay Famiglietti. ""People are spoiled in the United States. We've had relatively rich resources for so long we've never really had to deal with this before and we don't want to change.""

As a practical matter Famiglietti a University of Saskatchewan hydrology professor who tracks water basins worldwide via NASA satellite data said Mississippi River states also experience dry spells and the watershed the fourth largest in the world also ebbs and flows.

Real solutions

So what are the solutions to the arid West's dilemma as climate change heats up and California's State Water Project along with Lake Mead and Lake Powell shrivels due to reduced snowmelt and rainfall?

Famiglietti said it's time for a national water policy not to figure out where to lay down hundreds of pipes but to look comprehensively at the intertwining of agriculture and the lion's share of water it uses.

For him that includes setting aside at least portions of the so-called ""Law of the River"" a complicated century-old set of legal agreements that guarantees farmers in Southern California the largest share of water.

""Should we move the water to where the food is grown or is it maybe time to think about moving the food production to the water?"" he said.

In southeastern California officials at the Imperial Irrigation District which is entitled to by far the largest share of Colorado River water say any move to strip their rights would result in legal challenges that could last years. General Manager Henry Martinez also warned that cutting water to Imperial Valley farmers and nearby Yuma County Arizona could lead to a food crisis as well as a water crisis.

Martinez an engineer who oversaw the construction of pipelines in the Sierra Nevada for Southern California Edison agrees a 1500-mile pipeline from the Mississippi could physically be built. But he said the days of mega-pipelines in the U.S. are likely over due to lack of environmental and political will.

Famiglietti also said while oil companies are willing to spend millions because their product yields high profits per gallon that's not the case with water typically considered a public resource.

Tapping waste to fill taps

Famiglietti said as long as urban areas in the West don't persist in untrammeled growth they have enough supply for the immediate future with the ability to rip out lawns capture stormwater runoff in local reservoirs do municipal audits to fix leaks and other tools. But if areas like the Coachella Valley continue to approve surf wave parks and ""beachfront"" developments in the desert ""we're screwed"" he said bluntly.

Los Angeles-area water districts have implemented much of what Famiglietti mentioned. Water use has gone down 40% per capita in recent years said Coffey.

""I'm an optimist"" said Coffey who said local conservation is key.

He said a major wastewater reuse project that MWD plans to implement by 2032 could ultimately yield up 150 million gallons of potable water a day from treated waste. It will take liquid sewage treat it and either percolate it back into area groundwater or if California law is changed pipe it to water tanks across the basin. He said wastewater reuse by area agencies has already swelled from 0.20% in the 1980s to 12% of regional water supply.

The idea of drinking even heavily treated liquid waste may seem unpalatable but Westford thinks people will adapt. She points to her early work for comparison.

""I started with toilets I was the toilet queen of L.A."" said Westford. She and others worked to persuade reluctant consumers builders and policymakers to ditch widely used six-gallon flush toilets in favor of perfectly effective two-gallon versions. She said extensive public education aided by federal mandates and financial incentives eventually led to a wholesale transition that saves millions of gallons of water.

""My son will never know what a six-gallon toilet looks like"" she said.

An earlier version of this story misidentified for which agency Jennifer Pitt was a technical adviser. It was the Bureau of Reclamation.

Look what’s blooming on Lake Springfield

An American lotus blooms on Lake Springfield Aug. 7 2022. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

American lotuses are an aquatic plant that can cover large areas of water. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

American lotuses are part of the Nelumbonaceae family. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

Lotus flowers have long stalks with multiple petals and sepals which are small leaves on the outermost part of the flower. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

American lotuses are similar to water lilies (Nymphaea spp.) which have white pink or violet flowers that lack the round disk at the center and their leaves have a V-shaped notch. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

American lotus leaves can have a width as great as two feet. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

American lotuses can grow in oxbow lakes sloughs and ponds preferring still waters with a mud bottom. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

Despite its ornamental qualities American lotus should not be introduced into most fishing ponds according to MDC. Lotus spreads rapidly in shallow water and can soon completely cover a pond. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

American lotus is a valued native wildflower that is sometimes planted as an ornamental in aquatic gardening but can also become a nuisance aquatic plant. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

American lotus is listed as edible under MDC's website. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

American lotus seeds are acornlike and anchored in deep pits. Sara Karnes/Springfield News-Leader

The country is among the most water-scarce countries across the world.

Rosario Kisui who lives in Nairobi collects water from a stream near her home.

It takes Kisui and her neighbours around thirty minutes to fetch the water needed for daily chores.

""We live here with my children. I gave birth to my children here and raised them here. Since I moved here there has been no water. We wonder what's the purpose of this tap is or whether we can uproot it and throw it away because there is no water. We fetch water from the river. It is the water we use to bathe drink and cook with. At times our children have suffered from stomach aches. When our stomachs hurt we go to the hospital but sometimes we do not need to go to the hospital .Let us just survive because there is no other way. This is our water"" explains Kisui.

David Nyaga has been living in Nairobi for three years and only receives water to his home once a month because of water rationing.

Without regular supply he has to collect water from a well within his compound.

""I have been living here for three years now but the main issue that we are facing now is scarcity of water. So here water comes only once in a month. So I have to have a plan 'B' which is the borehole but the borehole water is not safe for drinking. So I just use it for cleaning washing and other things - because sparkling and bottled water prices are very high which I cannot afford"" explains Nyaga.

In Kenya 9.9 million people drink directly from contaminated surface water sources estimates UNICEF.

Beth Koigi CEO of Majik Water had her own experience of having to buy contaminated water while at university.

Koigi explains she wanted to find a way to curb the issue of water scarcity in Kenya's informal settlement areas.

Majik Water is a social enterprise that specialises in air-to-water technologies. The company was started in 2017 by three founders - Beth Koigi Anastacia Kaschenko and Clare Sewell - and began production at the end of 2019.

""Basically this machine is called an atmospheric water generator and it can produce up to 500 litres of water (per day). But sometimes if the humidity is higher than 60%; relative humidity - it can produce all the way to 700 litres of water. But basically this machine uses dehumidification processes so we basically condense the water vapour in the atmosphere"" Koigi explains.

There are twenty machines in Kenya.

The cost of the machines range from $9000 to $12500 once installed the water supply is free.

Each day the machine produces from 50 litres per day to 1000 litres.

""In this device we have four major components. So we have the fans which basically bring in air and then we have the condensation bit which is inclusive of you know the refrigerant components the condensing coils. And then we have now the filtration system which we include as an added component but that depends on the contaminant that we may have. For example here in Kibera we may have contaminants that is related to sewage because we have open sewage here. So we may add a filtration system to remove that. So that is very dependent on the place and then we have now the collecting tank"" explains Koigi.

Several machines have been installed all over the country - including at this school in Kibera.

Nelson Mandela Safu a teacher at St. Juliet Primary School explains:

""Previously before we received the machine we had an issue with our school hygiene. We used to wash our toilets once per week and the same same water of the same same container that we used to fetch water in from the nearby sellers are the same same water that our children used to drink. And we had a lot of cases on a daily basis: 'Teacher I have a problem I have a stomach ache' and all that. But today as we speak I am very happy to say that our toilets are clean the machine can produce water that we can use to wash toilets. The same same clean water our children are able to take. Even us as teachers are comfortable in school because we have fresh water to drink.""

The U.N. warned earlier this year that an estimated 13 million people are facing severe hunger in the wider Horn of Africa region as a result of persistent drought conditions.

The extreme drought in Kenya where 3.5 million people are affected by severe food insecurity and acute malnutrition has exacerbated the factors causing people to go hungry.

But air-to-water technology is costly and under funded explains Nelson Owange chief of party livestock market system program and advisor on drought at Mercy Corp an NGO and humanitarian aid organisation.

""Equipment and machines that are able to suck water from the atmosphere as long as the machine is connected on a power source - and then those water can then be used for household consumption. These innovations have not been scaled-up due to of course lack of funding and quite a number of them are expensive. So that we can get good enough water not only for household consumption but also for irrigation and for livestock consumption""

The UNCCD says climate change is expected to increase the risk of droughts in many vulnerable regions of the world particularly countries that are experiencing a fast growth in population.

It says 129 countries will experience and increased exposure to drought because of climate change.

After flooding drought is the most widespread disaster threatening the world today according to the UN and it says Africa is the worst hit continent.",,,,,,

AstraZeneca to acquire single-asset TeneoTwo a spinout from TeneoBio for $100 million up front

AstraZeneca is adding a clinical bispecific T cell engager to its pipeline in a deal that brings the total sale price of TeneoBio and associated assets to $1.4 billion across three upfront payments. Amgen acquired TeneoBio last year for $900 million upfront AbbVie had previously purchased another single-asset affiliate TeneoOne for $400 million upfront. TeneoTwo was among three asset-focused start-ups created to house programs not included in the Amgen takeout.

The performance of Apple (AAPL) has been better than other tech stocks lately as the company’s financial results and the strength of its brand has played in its favour.

The downtrend prompted by a deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop in the US hit a short-term bottom in mid-June after the price tagged the $130 level. Since then AAPL has been rallying and has managed to trim its yearly losses to just 4.3% as of 12 August.

With the share price currently sitting just 8% away from hitting all-time highs again is it a good time for Apple to consider a stock split? In this article we discuss what a stock split is whether it can happen soon and if it could boost the price of AAPL shares.

What is a stock split?

A stock split increases the number of a company’s outstanding shares. After a split shares are worth a fraction of what they were. Current stockholders are entitled to receive the newly issued shares in proportion to the number of shares they possess at the moment.

The price of each share is reduced once the operation is completed. However the value of the company’s equity or that of the investors’ holdings is not affected as their ownership is not diluted.

Apple has completed several stock splits in the past. On 28 August 2020 the company split its stock into four. This means that shareholders received three additional shares for every share of the company they owned after the AAPL stock split was completed and owned four shares in total as a result.

If the pre-split price was hypothetically $100 a share back then the post-split price would be $25 – the result of dividing $100 by four.

Stock splits are typically performed to increase the stock’s liquidity by lowering its price. Common reasoning for this operation is that it could make the asset more accessible for retail investors with a lower investment budget. A stock split could incentivise traders to invest in low-priced stocks to build a diversified portfolio.

However with the introduction of fractional shares and contracts for difference (CFDs) investors can now get exposure to virtually any listed stock by investing a much smaller initial amount.

Apple stock split history

According to Apple’s investor website the company’s stock has been split five times. Here are the dates and details of those Apple stock splits:

Since the 2014 stock split shares have gained approximately 642% as Apple’s business has performed positively during that period and macroeconomic conditions have also been favourable.

Meanwhile after the 2020 4-for-1 Apple stock split the price of the shares has increased by 47.3%. These gains cannot be directly linked to the split.

When will Apple stock split again?

The Board of Directors of Apple has not indicated that they have the intention to split the company’s stock any soon. However the stock price is nearing all-time highs again and that could prompt the management to consider another AAPL stock split to remain an appealing portfolio addition to both retail investors and investment funds in terms of liquidity and per-share value.

The fact that Apple has done this five times in the past makes this step possible. A 4-for-1 split or even a 5-for-1 split could have lowered the price to the low $40s or $30s based on its current trading price (as of 12 August).

Will the Apple stock split boost its share price?

Stock splits have no impact on the company’s fundamentals such as the performance of its business or the health of its balance sheet. They also don’t provide any additional capital to the firm and they do not result in gains for investors.

However stock splits tend to show short-term upticks in the price of some high-flying tech stocks such as Shopify (SHOP) Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOG) Tesla (TSLA) as retail investors appear to be drawn to these events to speculate on price fluctuations.

Whether this will be the case for AAPL stock if a split does happen is unclear and there are no guarantees that the stock’s historically positive post-split performance seen in the past will repeat in the future.

That said stock splits are typically a good indication of a company’s resilience. If the share price has risen to the point that a split becomes a good idea it suggests the company has managed to increase its value significantly as a result of the positive performance of its core business.

Apple (AAPL) analyst sentiment

According to data compiled by MarketBeat as of 12 August the consensus recommendation for Apple stock stood at ‘moderate buy’ based on the opinion of 33 analysts. From that group 24 rated the stock a ‘buy’ seven rated it a ‘hold’ and two believed the stock could be a ‘sell’.

Meanwhile the average price target for Apple stock stood at $179.4 resulting in a 6.48% upside potential based on 11 August’s closing price of $168.49. The highest 12-month target was set at $210 and the lowest at $136 per share.

Since July 2022 analysts’ actions have been mixed as three firms – KeyCorp Evercore ISI and Citigroup –have boosted their price targets for Apple. Other analysts have lowered their forecasts for the stock including Wells Fargo Morgan Stanley Barclays and Bank of America.

In regards to the company’s outlook Abhinav Davuluri Sector Strategist at Morningstar stated : “While we remain positive on Apple's ability to extract sales from its installed base via new products and services we believe demand for Apple’s products is likely to slow in the next few quarters following several stellar quarters of growth”.

Morningstar analyst also believes broader hardware sales could slow as consumers deal with inflation rising and a potential recession looming.

Davuluri added: “Supply constraints for the September quarter are expected to be lower than those experienced during the June quarter though we suspect macroeconomic headwinds (inflationary pressures and recessionary fears) are likely curbing demand for Apple’s hardware products. The firm is also facing foreign exchange headwinds which are expected to negatively affect September quarter sales by 600 basis points.”

If you’re interested in trading Apple stock after the split follow the latest Apple stock split news and company updates. However there is no guarantee that it could happen any time soon as the company hasn’t expressed the intention to do so yet.

If you’re considering Apple as a potential asset to trade now bear in mind that analysts’ forecasts can be wrong. Their projections are based on making a fundamental and technical study of the stock’s performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

It’s important to do your own research and always remember that your decision to trade depends on your attitude to risk your expertise in the market the spread of your investment portfolio and how comfortable you feel about losing money. You should never trade more than you can afford to lose.

Google is again sending a message to Apple: Fix the text messaging issues between Android devices and iPhones.

For years consumers have voiced their annoyance over the handling of text messages on smartphones between the top two messaging platforms: Apple's proprietary iMessage and Google's Messages app which uses Rich Communications Services (RCS).

Both platforms supercharge regular text messages — allowing for features like higher quality images read receipts text effects enhanced security reactions and other benefits. But because the platforms aren't compatible text messages between iPhones and Androids revert to regular outdated text messages.

This lack of interoperability leads to a major annoyance for some. Outgoing texts from iPhones to Android devices show up in a green bubble on the iPhone while appearing as blue when going to another iPhone. Incoming texts on iPhones show up in light gray.

Messages between Android and Apple phones are turned into SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) texts which Google charges are ""out-of-date technologies from the 90s and 00s."" As a result images sent in messages between Android and iPhones are compressed Google says and users can't tell if see if messages have been received and read. Google has claimed this distinction leads to ""peer pressure and bullying"" in favor of iMessages and iPhones.

Smartphones:How to properly clean your iPhone or Android to extend its life

Google is going on the offensive again with a website encouraging Apple to adopt RCS so the messaging systems interoperate.

""It’s not about the color of the bubbles. It’s the blurry videos broken group chats missing read receipts and typing indicators no texting over Wi-Fi and more"" Google's site declares. ""These problems exist because Apple refuses to adopt modern texting standards when people with iPhones and Android phones text each other.""

When Google's ""Apple should fix what's broken"" website went live Tuesday tech news site Business Insider wrote how ""Some users have long lamented the green message bubbles that come with cross-device messaging as well as poor-quality compressed videos the lack of read receipts and other headaches.""

If Apple would adopt RCS instead Google says messages between Android and Apple smartphones would look better and would be encrypted.

Apple did not return USA TODAY'S request for comment about Google's campaign. But in the past the company has found some faults with RCS citing how it does not deliver full end-to-end encryption.

This isn't a new campaign for Google. In May at the tech giant's I/O conference Android product-management vice president Sameer Samat touted how Android had 500 million-plus RCS users and poked the competition: ""We hope every mobile operating system gets the message and upgrades to RCS.""

However Apple didn't bite. The next month at its own WWDC conference Apple did not mention RCS and announced new features for its messaging platform including options to recall or edit recently-sent messages.

Apple could increase interoperability between Android and iOS devices but it may not be in the company's best interests CNET senior editor Mike Sorrentino said in a column. ""Apple often touts its control over iOS as a selling point for consumers and shifting away from iMessage could jeopardize that.""

In today’s edition of Mark Gurman’s Power On newsletter Gurman says that Apple VP Advertising Platforms Todd Teresi aims to bring annual revenue into the ‘double digits’ up from about $4 billion-per-year today. That means (at least) a tripling of its current ad business is in sight.

Gurman says that Apple has already tested adding sponsored results to search results in the Maps app similar to the App Store Search Ads program. Ads could also possibly start appearing in the Apple Books and Apple Podcasts storefronts in future.

Apple ads revenue currently comes from a handful of sources; App Store Search Ads ads in Apple News and Apple Stocks (the news sections) and a share of commercials during MLB Friday Night Baseball streams.

In addition to bringing ads to other stock apps Apple has already announced that customers will start seeing more ads in the App Store. New ad units in iOS 16 will allow advertisers to place ads on the Today tab in the App Store and at the bottom of product pages for other apps.

As growth from Apple hardware sales has slowed over the last five or so years Apple has continued to expand into the money-making opportunities of its services divisions including ads. Apple first entered the ads business under CEO Steve Jobs with the announcement of iAd in 2010 which would see developers place Apple banner ads — instead of offerings from Google AdMob and others — in their apps. iAd was mostly a failure and was discontinued several years later.

Apple has been criticized for expanding its own advertising business whilst crippling the third-party ad market with privacy features such as App Tracking Transparency. At a customer level Apple risks its premium brand reputation if it goes too far with inserting ads into the user experience of its premium devices."

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out.

Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

“Mr. Kellyanne Conway celebrating my Victory in 2016!” Trump posted Thursday.

One photo showed Conway wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat with his wife former top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway and another showed him filming Trump with a crowd of supporters.

Conway who announced his divorce from Kellyanne Conway last year has become a frequent Trump critic.

While Kellyanne Conway remained loyal to Trump throughout his time in office he went on to fund The Lincoln Project with several other Republicans who were opposed to Trump and looking to keep him from securing a second term.

Since then the two have been battling it out on air and online criticizing one another. Conway a conservative lawyer has frequently commented on Trump’s web of legal battles.

In an interview last Thursday Conway dismissed Trump’s claims that he was not sleeping in court after reporters noticed Trump appeared to doze off during his hush money trial in New York.

Conway slammed Trump’s reputation for not arriving to Trump Tower before 11 a.m. as well as the at White House because he “wasn’t an early riser.” The court is requiring the former president to be in-person early in the morning.

In January Trump walked out of the courtroom when closing arguments began in his defamation case against writer E. Jean Carroll.

Now he must sit in court and restrain his comments because of a gag order and Conway said he doesn’t think Trump has the “complete ability to control himself.”

Buckley who paused to battle back tears as he spoke added “The role that he cherished most was husband and father.” Rubin is survived by his wife Leslie and four children.

“This is the moment when Sam would know exactly what to say” Buckley said. “These are the kinds of stories that he excelled in and (would) say the right things about someone and put someone’s life into perspective.

“… This station is filled with great sadness. A shock to all of us. He was here yesterday with all of us and then called in sick and then we learned the news this afternoon. So we’re not really sure what the circumstances are. … That’s what we know at this point is that Sammy is gone.”

TMZ reported that Rubin suffered a fatal heart attack Friday morning. A KTLA source told Variety that Rubin died at his home in Brentwood.

“Sam lived life to the fullest” Buckley said. “We don’t know exactly what happened but we know that it was sudden because he was here yesterday.”

KTLA reporter/anchor Eric Spillman also a longtime fixture at the station called into the KTLA afternoon newscast and said “I just can’t believe that we’re reporting this. It is such a shock.”

“Personally he was one of my best friends” Spillman said. “We worked together every day for 33 years.”

KTLA technology reporter Rich DeMuro wrote on X that he is “in absolute shock.” He posted a picture of himself with Rubin and wrote “Thinking the most of your family right now. So sorry. Morning news in Hollywood will never be the same without you.”

KTLA posted on X: “KTLA5 is profoundly saddened to report the death of Sam Rubin. Sam was a giant in the local news industry and the entertainment world and a fixture of Los Angeles morning television for decades. His laugh charm and caring personality touched all who knew him. Same was a loving husband and father the roles he cherished the most. Our thoughts are with Sam’s family during this difficult time.”

During his celebrated career Rubin — an Occidental College graduate —collected multiple Emmy Awards and a Golden Mike and Los Angeles Press Club awards for best entertainment reporter as well as a lifetime achievement award from the Southern California Broadcasters Association.

He was also a founding member of the Broadcast Film Critics Association the organization behind the Critics’ Choice Movie Awards an event Rubin hosted in 2013.

Rubin was also the owner of the SRE Inc. television production company which according to his KTLA biography has produced more than 200 hours of broadcast and cable programming including the talk show “Hollywood Uncensored” and the “Live From” red carpet shows.

He was also known for his charitable efforts annually promoting the Bay to Bay bike ride from Orange County to San Diego to raise funds for multiple sclerosis research.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvbm90LWRlYWQteWV0LWNhbmNlbGVkLWFiYy0xMjM1OTExMTMwL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvbm90LWRlYWQteWV0LWNhbmNlbGVkLWFiYy0xMjM1OTExMTMwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Not Dead Yet’ Canceled After 2 Seasons At ABC,"After two seasons ABC has canceled the Gina Rodriguez-led and executive-produced comedy series Not Dead Yet.

Written by Casey Johnson and David Windsor Not Dead Yet centers on newly single and feeling-old Nell Stevens (Rodriguez) a self-described disaster who works to restart the life and career she left behind 10 years ago. A once-successful journalist Nell put her career on hold to help her fiancé get his restaurant off the ground. Following their breakup she takes the only job she can get – writing obituaries – which at first seems like a step backward but ultimately might be exactly what she needs to move forward.

Hannah Simone Lauren Ash Rick Glassman Joshua Banday Angela E. Gibbs Jesse Garcia and Brad Garrett also star.

When the show premiered in early 2023 it was ABC’s most-watched comedy debut in more than 4 years. However the ratings didn’t stick in Season 2. Deadline’s Editor-in-Chief of TV Nellie Andreeva wrote of the show last month “The single-camera Not Dead Yet is heavily on the bubble. Its ratings have been soft making for some bleak prospects though the series starring Gina Rodriguez is said to have its supporters internally and could potentially find a spot next season based on ABC’s scheduling needs.”

The Bottom Line

Investors looking to invest in large-cap companies can explore the potential of these top software companies. However investors should remember to be cautious and selective about the business domain served by the software companies as the performance of the underlying business sector will reflect on the return of the software companies as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0b2NrZG9yay5jb20vbWV0YXZlcnNlLXN0b2Nrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 9 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy For %currentmonth%‌ %currentyear%,"Metaverse stocks are a gateway to get in on the ground floor of a revolutionary tech that may reshape online interactions for years to come. But should you jump on the bandwagon as early as now? Read on to discover our picks for the best metaverse stocks to buy now.

In 2004 Facebook bought the startup virtual reality company Oculus kick-starting its journey to the metaverse. However Facebook’s virtual reality (VR) division struggled to sell products to the market when first released.

Consequently it made it seem like a fad — expensive equipment that will never replace PC and mobile gaming. However Zuckerberg’s recent announcement that Facebook would be rebranded as a metaverse company sparked investor interest in the metaverse concept.

Meta recently transitioned to its new ticker META this year. Because Facebook is already a collection of communities through its many apps and communication channels it makes sense for the corporation to shift to the metaverse.

Given Facebook’s leading stock position and present first-mover status in work-related applications the company might arrive there sooner than others. Moreover its profitability and cash flow generation are undeniably massive which puts most investors at ease.

Meta’s stock trades at a multiple of 12.3 based on the previous four quarters’ average earnings per share of $13.22 for the company. Compared to the Nasdaq 100 index which trades at a multiple of 25.2 it is a 51% discount.

Therefore for Meta stock to trade at the current market price of $334 or a $905 billion market value it would need to increase by 104%. The corporation is continually expanding so $1 trillion appears easily attainable by 2030.

In the long run some projections indicate that the value of the metaverse market by 2030 might range from $1.6 trillion to $30 trillion.

With a committed burn of $10 billion on its Reality Labs division in 2021 and an additional $2.9 billion in the first quarter of 2022 Meta has the greatest firepower of any group creating it.

Roblox Corp. (NYSE: RBLX)

Roblox has created a massive virtual world with over 11 million unique experiences and 50 million active players on any given day. It has already embraced the metaverse in many ways by offering this immersive space to gamers across the globe.

Players can also use the Roblox Studio to create new 3D spaces for anyone to enjoy. The platform is tied together through the Roblox Cloud providing the infrastructure to bring everything together.

While created for younger audiences Roblox has expanded to accommodate all ages of gamers and casual players alike. Catching the eye of popular artists the system has already hosted several virtual events and concerts.

The company only went public in March of 2021 and share prices have dropped considerably since then.

Roblox appears to be a case study for many of the “stay-at-home” growth businesses in the first half of 2022. Its stock price was driven too low too quickly and is now stabilizing as Wall Street acknowledges its user and revenue growth is not slowing down.

The business is adding millions of new users on average every day which will keep its income engine running smoothly in the years to come.

Additionally the company’s challenging year-over-year comparisons should return to normal in the upcoming months as fewer pandemic restrictions kept youngsters at home during the second half of 2021.

However it’s crucial to keep in mind that Roblox is more than simply a “stay-at-home” investment. The firm continues to attract new consumers for its content as seen by its daily active user and hours of engaged statistics.

Each day this user base gets older (and has more money to spend).

Roblox is also a reasonably inexpensive form of entertainment. Roblox becomes increasingly alluring if the cost of other extracurricular activities rises quickly due to inflation. The business is still a long-term buy-and-hold investment.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)

At Ignite 2021 Microsoft stated that it wanted to be the firm powering the metaverse. The company is seeking a “permanent digital universe that is related to many parts of the actual world including people places and objects” rather than what Stephenson envisioned in 1992.

Microsoft’s aspirations are less ambitious than Meta’s at least for the time being emphasizing bridging the gap between office and remote employees. The firm has announced that it will begin with Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces.

Mesh a second product will combine with Microsoft’s famous Teams program to allow remote employees to communicate with office workers in meetings using customized avatars.

With an increase in revenue of 18% and operating income up by 19% from last year Microsoft remains a powerhouse within the tech industry. Microsoft announced that it plans to purchase Activision Blizzard in a blockbuster $68.7 billion deal in mid-January.

With one of the biggest studio acquisitions in recent years the company could potentially change the video game landscape through its presence in the Metaverse. Despite the tech market taking a hit overall share prices are up roughly 10% from last year.

This is likely due to the continued success of Azure and its Office 365 platform.

Even better Microsoft’s current price-to-earnings ratio of 27.6 is far lower than the 34.6 multiple it has averaged over the last five years. Investors should consider taking advantage of opportunities to purchase shares in best-in-class IT companies at a reduced price.

Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP)

Snap Inc. controls many of many social media companies in the metaverse including Snapchat Spectacles and Bitmoji. Originally known as Snapchat Inc. the company rebranded itself to Snap Inc. on September 24 2016 to include the Spectacles product under its name.

Rather than being a virtual reality experience which completely immerses the user the company is developing augmented reality.

Unlike virtual reality where users are largely oblivious to their physical surroundings augmented reality empowers them and blends the digital and physical worlds.

The app company hopes to empower people to express themselves in new ways while expanding friendships within the metaverse. Snap’s stock price has been on a downward trend resting 55% lower than last year.

This is likely due to missed opportunities with revenue and earnings per share. However Snap is looking to climb out of this hole and surpass its competitors.

Snap’s most recent earnings report was on April 21. While exceeding forecasts for daily active users the firm failed expectations for profitability sales and average revenue per user in the first quarter.

Snap shares fell another 30 percent in May. The business disclosed in advance that it would not reach its second-quarter projection continuing its downward trend that began after the earnings failure.

None of this appears to be really positive for Snap. The good news is that there is little anticipation for Snap’s second-quarter earnings. Wall Street analysts have decreased their full-year earnings-per-share (EPS) forecasts for Snap over the past 90 days.

By the end of July Snap is expected to release its second-quarter earnings. The business may see a boost if it meets or exceeds its already modest expectations. Furthermore it’s conceivable that management identified the issues and has already created plans to fix them.

Snap has introduced a brand-new subscription service called Snapchat+. Subscribers may access specific features within the Snapchat app for $3.99 monthly. Snap’s reliance on advertising won’t be resolved but it’s a start.

After years of living in Meta’s shadow Snap says it finally has a chance to get a win over its main competitor as it has recovered more quickly than anticipated from privacy changes.

Unity Software Inc. (NASDAQ: U)

Unity Software founded in 2004 is firmly poised to profit from metaverse technology. The tech company provides a platform for creating and operating real-time interactive 3D content.

Its software sees use within filmmaking the gaming industry augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality devices.

Unity helps big game studios and small businesses quickly and efficiently build and run high-quality games allowing them to compete in the global video game market.

Games created on its platform are seen on various systems including PlayStation Xbox iOS Android and Windows.

During the company’s recent earnings call CEO John Riccitiello mentioned that Unity will “support and shape metaverse” and “emphasize content creation cross-platform access.” Also highlighted was the company’s 43% increase in revenue ($315.9 million) from last year.

With its recent acquisition of its long-time partner Metaverse Technologies Inc. Unity Software is ahead of the competition in metaverse development.

While some investors are concerned about Unity’s present difficulties they are only anticipated to last a short while. To develop its platform the management team is resolving the technological problems and using the knowledge obtained from the experience.

Unity’s SaaS business model and ecosystem have a proven track record of generating profits. Additionally it has a strong financial sheet with total assets of $4.9 billion at the end of the first quarter including $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents and total liabilities of $2.6 billion.

Even if the U.S. economy enters a recession long-term investors stand to gain from Unity’s present stock price decline. According to research the stock market often recovers from recessions especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite.

The positive aspects of Unity make the stock a good long-term investment.

Top Metaverse Stocks

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)

Nvidia has long been regarded as one of the best semiconductor companies and video processing chip producers globally currently powering self-driving cars bitcoin mining and cloud gaming.

Its video processing chips boost computing power to a higher degree than most of its competitors making this brand appealing to consumers. This is also why crypto miners are a hot commodity Nvidia graphics cards.

The company’s move into artificial intelligence (AI) and other fast-processing technology makes it a significant player in the metaverse.

Nvidia recently launched its Omniverse Enterprise to the general public to take advantage of the growing opportunities in the metaverse industry.

Omniverse is an open virtual reality platform where design teams worldwide can collaborate to create and simulate 3D renderings in real-time.

Its potential adoption in the enterprise sector specifically in design as a real-time simulation will significantly increase engineering productivity.

Looking at its financials Nvidia is in an excellent position profit-wise.

The market value of Nvidia stock which previously traded at more than $850 billion has dropped by 56% from its peak. Given that it is involved in several multibillion-dollar prospects it is plausible to assume that by 2030 it will reach or even surpass its previous peak.

If the firm achieves the forecasted revenue of $33.5 billion for the fiscal year 2023 it will have increased the measure at a compound annual rate of 28% during the previous five years.

It will be sufficient for Nvidia to surpass the $1 trillion value milestone if it keeps up that growth pace through 2030 providing its steady price-to-sales ratio. In fact even a growth rate of half that would be sufficient.

Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP)

One of the most critical aspects of the metaverse is that its developers desire a thriving economy within integrated virtual online environments. Assets cash and the capacity for content producers to be compensated must all be digitized in the virtual world.

That’s where Shopify comes in.

Shopify is an integrative e-commerce platform that supports businesses in selling products and services online. Since its humble beginnings the company has grown its toolkit and offers to include various ancillary items that small companies require to succeed.

This year it took two significant initiatives that relate to the possibilities of metaverse commerce. One example is the purchase of the augmented reality app Primer.

This acquisition provides Shopify with an effective tool in the metaverse allowing members to build up possible storefronts in the digital world.

Shopify is also developing a new NFT platform allowing digital producers to directly sell art and other material to customers.

Thus it positions Shopify to link into the metaverse and offers it a footing in the virtual world’s future business goals. As these future ambitions unfold the company is still doing its best to develop e-commerce solutions for businesses.

Being the top producer of such software and apps shares of this metaverse stock could be quite secure.

Also Shopify has become a force due to its “one-stop-shop” strategy for allowing e-commerce. In comparison to other companies aside from Amazon it currently has more e-commerce revenues coming via its network.

Shopify though could only be getting started. As more merchants turn their attention to online sales the platform’s $4.8 billion in revenue over the previous year represents just a small portion of the projected $153 billion (and increasing) global market opportunity.

Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK)

Autodesk was founded back in 1982 and is well-known for its two and three-dimensional software. Several products such as AutoCAD and Revit allow engineers designers architects and the like can create virtual designs of products buildings and more.

To help lay the foundation for the metaverse developers are using Autodesk’s software to create virtual worlds. Autodesk has embraced this trend setting up a line of software designed specifically for the virtual world.

To expand its virtual footprint Autodesk is in the process of acquiring The Wild specializing in extended reality. Share prices are lower than expected seeing a 30% drop over the last year. However its financials look strong providing Autodesk with some traction to clear the mud.

These software applications collectively generate substantial income and cash flow. Even with significant headwinds from foreign exchange management expects Autodesk to earn just over $2 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year.

Guidance anticipates double-digit free-cash-flow growth through the fiscal year 2026. The stock now trades at a forward P/FCF ratio of 20 with a market valuation of $41 billion.

Although this isn’t very inexpensive shareholders who hold for the long term should benefit from Autodesk’s history of success and aspirations for the future.

Cloudflare (NYSE: NET)

Cloudflare Inc. deals in American web infrastructure and website security providing content delivery network and DDoS mitigation services. The company connects a website’s visitor to its customer’s hosting provider by acting as a reverse proxy.

As part of Project Honey Pot an open-source project that monitors internet fraud and abuse Matthew Prince Lee Holloway and Michelle Zatlyn founded Cloudflare in 2009.

As of September 13 2019 Cloudflare opened public trading on the New York Stock Exchange after filing its S-1. Cloudflare stock hasn’t seen much growth since November 2021 resulting in a lower share price than last year.

NET stock’s profit in the fall quarter met analyst expectations while revenues exceeded expectations. Cloudflare reported non-GAAP earnings per share that were in line with analysts’ quarterly estimates.

The ability of Cloudflare to continuously construct products on top of its network has significantly increased its total addressable market.

According to the company the market opportunity has increased from $32 billion in 2018 to $115 billion in 2019 with a route to $135 billion by 2024. If a few of Cloudflare’s more recent products see greater success than anticipated that number may potentially increase.

With little under $1 billion in planned yearly revenue this year Cloudflare is still in the very early stages of its development story. No matter what the company is a must-watch because of its consistent profits and the current undervaluation of Cloudflare shares.

What You Need to Know About the Metaverse

Around the end of October Facebook made news when it announced that it would change its name to Meta and pursue creating a metaverse. The company’s vision is to create unified virtual online communities for people to play work and stay connected.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence metaverse technology could potentially be worth $800 billion in the next three years.

According to technologists the metaverse is a permanent shared 3D virtual world. People gather for various activities including playing games and conducting business.

However Mark Zuckerberg defined it as “an embodied internet that you’re inside of rather than just looking at.” A vast virtual reality space like the one in Ready Player One or Tron might be years away.

But Facebook and other forerunners are hard at work establishing the basis for a future in which family friends employees and others may meet and engage in shared digital places that look and feel real.

We are not simply referring to VR head gears and video conferencing. People will require real-world services from entertainment to money even online and that’s where the metaverse platform comes into play.

Organizations as diverse as Amazon Netflix DoorDash and Robinhood could contribute to an integrated virtual universe in the future.

Business Opportunities in the Metaverse

It’s easy to see the positives of living in a world free of physical restrictions within this virtual environment. These worlds will merge with the internet as a whole and other consumer smart devices with their distinct characteristics and themes.

In addition companies are rewarding developers of high-profile metaverse locales. As a result investors and huge IT companies are fighting for a piece of the metaverse pie and the chance to create their own metaverse platform.

This rivalry has the potential to generate massive developments in surrounding tech.

Should You Buy Metaverse Stocks?

Metaverse stocks could be one of the most promising investments on the stock market today. Even in its infancy stage the metaverse is showing a lot of potential as an investment.

Several technological powerhouses are scrambling to be the leaders in this growing industry. Even if there’s no easy way to forecast how things will turn out the companies listed above have demonstrated their stability and could be staples in metaverse technology.

However you should still do your due diligence before investing in any stock. If you want a piece of the action check out our best metaverse stocks list.

Where to Buy Metaverse Stock

Robinhood is an online investing platform where you can buy various U.S.-listed stocks margins and IPO investments. This app is available on Android and iOS and allows you to invest in the publicly traded metaverse stocks listed above without paying commissions.

Of these 35 studies met the inclusion criteria for downstream analysis (Tables 1 2 and 3). Four of these studies did not report sensitivity and specificity and were thus included in qualitative synthesis only15161718.

Four broad categories of methodologies were identified in POC detection of oral potentially malignant and malignant disorders: (1) classification based on clinical photographs (n = 11)219202122232526272829; (2) in vivo imaging using intra-oral optical imaging techniques (n = 18)1517303133343537383940414243444550; (3) thermal imaging (n = 1)16; (4) analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from breath samples (n = 5)1846474849. Just 8 studies were published before 20151534373844484950. The majority of studies provided data on classification of OSCC vs healthy (n = 13)16181923313338424346474849 8 studies provided data on OSCC/OPMD vs healthy2526283037394041 6 on OSCC/OPMD vs benign lesions151721353650 3 on OSCC vs benign293444 2 on OSCC vs other (healthy benign and OPMD)245 1 on OSCC/OPMD vs benign/healthy20 1 on OPMD vs healthy27 and 1 on OPMD vs benign22.

Given sample heterogeneity as indicated by forest plots (Supplementary Fig. S2) of univariate meta-analyses and quantitative measures of heterogeneity (sensitivity: Tau2 = 0.37 I2 = 62% p < 0.001; specificity: Tau2 = 0.70 I2 = 84% p < 0.001) a bivariate random-effects model for logit-transformed pairs of sensitivities and false positive rates was used to provide an estimate of diagnostic test performance. Across all studies the pooled estimates for sensitivity and false positive rates (FPR) were 0.892 [95% CI 0.866–0.913] and 0.140 [95% CI 0.108–0.180] respectively. The AUC was 0.935 (partial AUC restricted to observed FPRs of 0.877) indicating excellent classifier performance (Table 4; Fig. 3 top left panel).

Graphic Display of Study Heterogeneity (GOSH) plots were used to further explore causes of heterogeneity in the extracted data through the application of unsupervised clustering algorithms to identify influential outliers (Supplemental Fig. S3). 4 studies were found to substantially contribute to between-studies heterogeneity with respect to sensitivity27283340 and a further 6 studies were identified as potentially influential with respect to specificity20242533384346. Exclusion of these studies from a univariate random effects model of sensitivity (N = 27) and specificity (N = 24) resulted in a reduction in Higgins I2 to 0.0% [0.0; 42.5] (Tau2 = 0.27 Q(26) = 24.99 p = 0.52) for sensitivity and I2 60.8% [38.9; 74.8] (Tau2 = 0.39 Q(23) = 58.7 p < 0.0001). A sensitivity analysis was thus performed with influential outliers excluded (Table 4). Although these analyses provide an indication of influential outlying studies they do not inform on the likelihood of small study effects as a contributor of identified heterogeneity.

Funnel plots of both all studies and according to subgroup were initially used to investigate for small study effects (Supplemental Fig. S4). These funnel plots themselves provide an indication of possible publication bias with a number of studies demonstrating both a large effect size and standard error and the use of contour-enhancement does appear to identify a scarcity of studies in zones of low significance. Egger’s linear regression test supported plot asymmetry within studies reporting on classical machine learning methods (Supplemental Table S2). These results should be interpreted with caution however and plot asymmetry alone is not pathognomonic of publication bias. To further investigate small study effects as a possible cause for this asymmetry a bias-corrected estimate of the diagnostic odds ratio was determined using Duval and Tweedie’s Trim and Fill method which aims to re-establish symmetry of the funnel plot by imputing ‘missing’ effects to provide an adjusted diagnostic odds ratio that better reflects the true effect when all evidence is considered. This method did identify a reduction in effect size particularly in studies reporting on classical machine learning methods in classification in those examining the use of clinical photographs and in those classifying OSCC vs Healthy. Inspection of the funnel plots for these categories (Supplemental Fig. S4) does appear to show an absence of studies within regions of low significance supporting a conclusion that reporting bias may contribute to inflation of study effects in some subgroups.

A comparison of algorithm performance according to methodology (clinical photographs thermal imaging or analysis of volatile compounds) AI type (modern and classical) and lesion type (OSCC vs Healthy OSCC/OPMD vs Benign OSCC/OPMD vs Healthy) identified no differences in performance as indicated by overlap in confidence regions on sROC curves (Fig. 3) showing uniformly high performance irrespective of group. Moreover bivariate meta-regression found no significant differences in classification performance irrespective of methodology AI type or lesion type (Table 4). A comparison of lesion types undergoing classification was limited to OSCC vs Healthy OSCC/OPMD vs Benign OSCC/OPMD vs Healthy given the limited number of studies reporting results on other comparisons. Classification performance across subgroups was similar following exclusion of those studies identified as potentially influential.

Just 1 study met the inclusion criteria reporting on the use of thermal imaging in oral cancer detection16. In this study Chakraborty et al. exploited Digital Infrared Thermal Imaging (DITI) as a non-invasive screening modality for oral cancer. Their process of detection involves initial detection of left and right regions of interest (ROI) from infrared images using a FLIR T 650 SC long infrared camera. Rotation invariant feature extraction was then performed on ROI using a Gabor filter the responses of which are then used as input into a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) following transformation using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Fivefold cross validation on a dataset of 81 malignant 59 precancerous and 63 normal subjects identified an overall accuracy of 84.72% in distinguishing between normal vs malignant subjects.

18 studies used various methods of optical imaging for in-vivo detection of oral potentially malignant and malignant disorders153031333435363738394041424344455051 16 of which provided sufficient performance metrics for meta-analysis15. All studies were prospective in design. Estimates for sensitivity and false positive rate for this modality were 0.882 [95% CI 0.865–0.896] and 0.118 [0.112–0.197] respectively. AUC for the accompanying sROC curve (Fig. 3) was 0.914 (partial AUC of 0.867); again indicating good classifier performance. The majority of studies exploited perturbation in autofluorescence spectra in oral pathology as the principal method of detection. However there was variation in the source and wavelengths of excitation (Table 2). With exception to 11 studies (which used a support vector machine4045 relevance vector machine38 quadratic discriminant analysis36394142 Mahalanobis distance43 linear discriminant analysis3452 and decision tree37) the remaining studies demonstrated best performance using neural networks. In studies utilising ANN data pre-processing was similar involving some form of normalisation to standardise contrast and brightness before introduction of a size-adjusted image according to the base architecture (Supplementary Data S1). The exceptions here were Chan et al. who instead utilised a Gabor filter or wavelet transformation from a redox ratio image of FAD and NADH to ultimately generate a feature map as input Wang et al. who used partial least squares discriminant analysis on captured spectra to identify features as input and de Veld et al. who again utilised normalised autofluorescence spectra as input. 3 studies used augmentation to increase the size of the training dataset for ANN303351. Contrarily studies utilising classical ML techniques for classification were heavily reliant on manual region of interest (ROI) detection and manual feature extraction. All studies with exception to James et al. produced a series of spectral intensity-based features following normalisation as input for classification. James et al. instead adopted an ensemble approach whereby object detection and feature extraction were automated using ANNs before introduction into a support vector machine for classification. Best overall accuracy within the modern ML group was achieved by Chan et al. using Inception (accuracy of 93.3) to classify OSCC vs healthy and best performance within the classic group was achieved by Kumar et al. (accuracy 99.3) using Mahalanobis distance in classification of OSCC vs healthy.

Uthoff et al. performed a field-testing study of new hardware developed specifically for intra-oral classification of benign and (pre-)malignant lesions. The device in question designed to provide POC detection in low- and middle-income countries comprises an intra-oral probe connecting to a standard widely available smartphone that utilises 6 405 nm LEDs for autofluorescence and 4 4000 K LEDs for white light. Classification of autofluorescence spectra using a VGG-M architecture provided an accuracy of 86.88% and AUC of 0.908. Song et al. also used a custom smartphone-based intra-oral visualisation system exploiting 6 405 nm LEDs for excitation. This approach using a VGG-M architecture pretrained on ImageNet yielded an accuracy of 86.9% with sensitivity of 85.0% and specificity of 88.7%51. Other approaches for achieving autofluorescence in vivo included a xenon lamp with monochromator and spectrograph15 multispectral digital microscopy35 time-domain multispectral endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging FLIM36 N 2 laser38 confocal endomicroscopy (CFE)33 portable spectrophotometry3750 and optical coherence tomography45. Notably although in vivo and providing a prospect of POC detection the approach taken by Aubreville et al. of confocal laser endomicroscopy does require intra-venous administration of fluorescein prior to imaging and its utility as a POC detection tool may therefore be limited33. Both Huang et al. and Jeng et al. used the commercially available VELscope for autofluorescence imaging though both groups used different approaches to classification. Huang et al. determined the average intensity of red blue and green (RGB) channels and grayscale following grayscale conversion as input into quadratic discriminant analysis to distinguish between oral potentially malignant/malignant and healthy tissues reporting a sensitivity and specificity of 0.92 and 0.98 respectively39. While feature selection was similar to Huang’s group (extracting average intensity and standard deviation of intensity from grayscale-converted RGB images) Jeng et al. compared the performance of both linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) reporting an optimal performance using QDA on normalised images of the tongue (sensitivity of 0.92 precision 0.86)41.

11 of the 26 identified studies attempted diagnosis of oral potentially malignant or malignant disorders from clinical photographs1920212223242526272829 all of which utilised deep learning through various neural network architectures for classification and were retrospective in design (Table 1). All studies using clinical photographs provided performance metrics amenable to meta-analysis. Sensitivity and false positive rate were estimated as 0.911 [95% CI 0.848–0.950] and 0.118 [95%CI 0.070–0.192] respectively and AUROC was 0.952 (partial AUC of 0.90; Fig. 3). All studies in this category used neural networks for classification. The source of images was variable between studies with 4 studies using smart phone cameras as a potential easily-implementable POC source of data20242526 2 studies using heterogenous images from various camera types1921 3 studies using images from search engines/repositories222829 and 2 used high resolution single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras2327. Training and testing sample sizes varied between studies (Fig. 5) though 8 of the 11 studies used augmentation to enhance the size of the training set including scaling shearing rotation reflection and translation1920232425262728. With exception to Fu et al. (who used the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SDD) as a detection network) and Lin et al.24 (who used the automatic centre-cropping function of a smartphone grid) all remaining studies within this category depended upon manual ROI bounding thus still requiring a degree of clinical expertise prior to feature extraction and classification. Best overall accuracy of 99.28 was achieved by Warin et al.23 using DenseNet-161 (pretrained on ImageNet) in classification of OSCC from healthy.

Fu et al. developed a two-stage process of classification exploiting the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) as a detection convolutional neural network to initially define the region of interest before binary classification using DenseNet pretrained on ImageNet. In addition to demonstrating promising classification performance (AUROC 0.970) the developed deep learning algorithm also demonstrated superior performance in classification from clinical images compared to blinded non-medical professionals and post-graduate medical students majoring in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS). Both identified studies by Welikala et al. adopted a smart phone-based approach with a view to rapid POC detection of oral cancer in low and middle-income countries as part of the Mobile Mouth Screening Anywhere (MeMoSA) initiative. A range of convolutional neural networks were trained on provided images with best classification performance achieved through the VGG-19 architecture (Table 1). Both Tanriver et al. and Jeyaraj et al. attempted multiclass classification of either OSCC vs OPMD vs benign or normal vs benign vs malignant respectively. Both used search engines and existing data repositories as the source of input data for classification (though Tanriver supplemented these using clinical photography within their unit). Transfer learning with pretraining on ImageNet performed best using the EfficientNet-b4 architecture in Tanriver et al. reporting an F 1 of 0.86. Jeyaraj modified the Inception v3 architecture and compared to a support vector machine and deep belief network reporting a specificity of 0.98 and sensitivity of 0.94.

4 studies provided data on the use of an electronic nose as a POC device to detect malignancy-associated volatile compounds from exhaled breath (Table 3) all with exception to Mentel et al. providing outcomes amenable to meta-analysis46474849. All studies were prospective in design. Pooled estimates for sensitivity and false positive rate were 0.863 [95% CI 0.764–0.924] and 0.238 [95% CI 0.142–0.372] and AUC was estimated at 0.889 (partial AUC of 0.827). All 4 studies utilised some form of portable electronic ‘nose’ (eNose) to detect volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath of either patients with a confirmed diagnosis of malignancy or healthy controls. Van der Goor et al. and Mohamed et al. used eNose devices with a combination of micro hotplate metal-oxide sensors to detect changes in conductivity with redox reactions of volatile organic compounds on heating. Leunis instead analysed air samples using 4 sensor types—CH 4  CO NO x and Pt—and Hakim et al. used a device dependent upon spherical gold nanoparticles. Van der Goor et al. and Mohamed et al. both used tensor decomposition (Tucker3) to generate a single input vector for training of a neural network from the 64 × 36 datapoints generated per sensor achieving sensitivities of 84% and 80% and specificities 80% and 77% in detecting OSCC. Leunis et al. instead used logistic regression in binary classification using measurements from only the NO x sensor to avoid collinearity. This achieved a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 80%. Hakim et al. used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for initial clustering before training a linear support vector machine on principle components 1 and 2—this method achieved a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92%. Mental et al. used a commercially available BreathSpect device for sample collection using two-fold separation with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to detect VOCs. The output from the affiliated software is a 2-dimensional image representation of both VOC drift time and parts-per-billion. This output was used to train various classical machine learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbours random forest logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis) with best performance of an accuracy of 0.89 using logistic regression.

Several approaches to ML were used across the identified studies in their pursuit for detection of oral potentially malignant and malignant disorders. For clarity the hierarchical classification presented by Mahmood et al. is adopted here53. ML classification algorithms may be subdivided into modern techniques and classical techniques (Fig. 4). The majority of identified studies used supervised algorithms for classification (following feature selection where necessary) whereby the machine is trained on annotated data. The majority of studies reported best outcomes using various architectures of neural networks. All studies on analysis of photographic images used deep learning (neural networks with more than one hidden layer) the most popular architecture of which being VGG neural networks172225263051. This is perhaps unsurprising since VGGNet was developed as an extension of the revolutionary AlexNet5455.

Several studies compared multiple different machine learning methods in classification. Shamim et al. used transfer learning with multiple convolutional neural networks pretrained on ImageNet including AlexNet GoogLeNet VGG19 ResNet50 Inception v3 and SqueezeNet achieving the optimal performance using the VGG19 CNN with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 97%22. Welikala et al. compared VGG16 VGG19 Inception v3 ResNet50 and ResNet101 all pretrained on ImageNet and applied through transfer learning; VGG19 again proved to provide the best detection of suspicious lesions from clinical images. Tanriver et al. found optimal performance using the EfficientNet-b4 architecture in clinical image classification.

Fifteen studies used “classical” ML algorithms. Roblyer et al. and Rahman et al. used linear discriminant analysis for classification of features extracted from autofluorescence images. Jo et al. and Huang et al. used quadratic discriminant analysis. Duran-Sierra et al. exploited an ensemble approach of both quadratic discriminant analysis and a support vector machine demonstrating superior performance in classification of normalised ratios from autofluorescence images than the two approaches independently. Francisco et al. used decision trees Chakraborty et al. and Hakim et al. used support vector machines Majumder et al. a relevance vector machine and Leunis et al. used logistic regression. James et al. also adopted an ensemble approach employing ANN for feature extraction prior to a support vector machine for classification. Feature selection and reduction for input into classical machine learning algorithms was also achieved through a variety of methods including Principle Component Analysis49 tensor decomposition4647 Gabor feature extraction and discrete wavelet transformation31. The only study utilising an unsupervised machine learning approach for classification (rather than feature selection) was Kumar et al. who initially used PCA for dimensionality reduction before Mahalanobis distance classification of the first 11 identified principal components.

Sample sizes for training and validation sets were hugely variable between studies. Test set sample size ranged from 5 per sample31 to 407933. An overview of training and test set sample sizes is provided in Fig. 5. Training sample sizes are estimates only as some papers did not report total sample size post-augmentation and so only the initial training sample size was recorded (and may therefore be underestimated). 16 of the 35 included studies did not report on software for implementation of machine learning methods. Of those using modern ML methods 7 studies used the Keras application programming interface20212325273335 2 used PyTorch 1 used the Python Scikit-learn machine learning library 2 studies used proprietary software accompanying the eNose4647 and 1 study used the Deep Learning Toolbox and Parallel Learning Toolbox within MATLAB22.

Some believe that automation will take away jobs from humans and this will be the end of the world as we know it. While others believe that AI will create more jobs than it takes away.

This debate is still ongoing but there are some facts about how automation and AI are affecting our lives today. We can see how automation has impacted the workforce in different industries such as manufacturing transportation healthcare and many more.

The impact of automating various roles in these industries can be seen by looking at what happened to employment rates in these sectors after technological advancements were made. For instance employment rates dropped significantly after the introduction of automated manufacturing systems such as industrial robots or computer-controlled machine tools.

The future of jobs is uncertain but one thing is certain – automation will play a major role in the future

It has already started to happen.

Automation has been happening since the Industrial Revolution but it was not until recently that the pace of automation increased. In fact there are now more jobs lost than created by automation.

We must understand what automation means and what we can do about it.

In the future automation and AI will have a major impact on jobs in fields such as engineering law medicine and even journalism.

This will lead to a different kind of job creation that focuses more on creativity and emotions than just coding or data analysis.

How Artificial Intelligence is changing the way work is performed

Automation is already replacing human workers with robots. This could be in the form of software machines and robots. This trend has been going on for a long time and is predicted to continue for a long time.

The benefits of automation are that it can –

reduce labour costs

increase productivity

and improve quality

However this trend also poses some challenges such as job displacement and worker re-skilling.

The future of work is changing day by day. With the help of AI work can be more efficient and less time-consuming.

Artificial Intelligence has been around for a while now. But in the last few years it has made a huge impact on the way we work. AI can do tasks that were considered impossible just a few years ago and it will continue to change our lives in the near future.

AI can read data learn from them and provide insights about them on its own without any human input. This makes it possible for companies to automate some of their business processes with much less human input needed than before.

How will automation affect your career? And does it make sense to be concerned?

The first and most obvious change that automation has brought about is the loss of jobs. This has been especially true in manufacturing transportation and agriculture. In these sectors such as trucking and farming automation has reduced labour costs drastically.

We are living in a time when automation is becoming increasingly popular. Automation is the process of using machines or computer programs to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence such as manual work.

All individuals need to hone their skills. If you don’t do it you will be losing job opportunities. Acquire a skill that’s relevant to the market to the current situation.

Think of some business goals that are in line with AI and automation. If you could employ AIs and automation in your favour you will be boosting your career growth. In the past automation has always been seen as a threat to jobs. However with recent advancements in technology and AI it has become more favourable to use automation rather than humans. This is because it can lead to greater efficiency and improve productivity.

Employers need to be aware of the benefits and drawbacks of automation so they can make informed decisions about how they want to use it in their business. Employers should also consider the impact on employees when making decisions about whether or not they will automate their business processes.

Examples of jobs taken away by automation:

Factory workers replaced by robots

Taxi drivers replaced by self-driving cars

Retail store cashiers replaced by self-checkout systems

On the other hand AI has the potential to provide more job opportunities for humans in the future.

Examples of job opportunities created with AIs and automation:

Software developer opportunities to create bots

Data Scientists

Research and development

Which jobs are most likely to be replaced by automated processes?

The process of automation has been happening for a long time; it is just that the rate at which it is happening has been increasing.

Automation is not a new phenomenon. There have been automated processes in different fields such as manufacturing and farming for a long time. However the pace of automation has increased in recent years due to technological advancements and the rise of AI.

The use of AI tools has also been on the rise to help companies automate repetitive tasks.

The most recent trend is to automate customer service calls with bots or conversational AIs which are computer programs designed to mimic human interactions over text or voice communication channels.

Some jobs are more likely to be replaced by automated processes than others. The most common jobs that are at risk of being replaced by automation include administrative assistants telemarketers data entry and drivers.

The types of jobs that have a lower risk of being replaced by automation include:

In the long run automation will replace jobs that are highly repetitive and require little skill. For example most of the jobs that have a lower risk of being replaced by automation include:

Jobs with high levels of creativity and autonomy

Jobs that require a lot of social interaction

Jobs that require creativity and emotional intelligence

How can we start using AI now to prepare for the future jobs that will be lost in 10 years?

There are many industries where AI has already made a huge impact. This includes areas like finance healthcare transportation and education. In the future AI will be able to do even more things that humans can’t do now.

The future of jobs will be uncertain and many factors have to be considered when trying to predict what jobs will exist in the future. However it is important to prepare for these changes because it takes time to retrain human employees so they can adapt to the new job requirements.

Debate on AI is endless it has two sides that are going to continue. The wait is to see its real impact. Governments and corporates need to create and secure some more job opportunities that are relevant to the current world situation.

There are many different ways in which we can start using AI now so that we can prepare for the future jobs that will be lost in 10 years. One way is by understanding how AI works and how it could help us instead of replacing us. Another way is to train AI to use data in a way that benefits humanity.

The efficiency of each individual is indeed leveraged by asking them to do the work that only humans are capable of. It’s a win-win situation for AI and human working professionals.

Humans just need re-skilling themselves to fit the current norms.

CHELSEA are under new ownership for the first time in two decades.

Roman Abramovich's reign at Stamford Bridge was a popular one with supporters but was brought to an end by UK Government sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

And the beneficiary of that situation was US billionaire Todd Boehly whose consortium purchased the Blues for £4.25bn at the end of May.

Upon buying Chelsea Boehly promised to take a hands-on role in running the club in contrast to fellow Americans the Glazer family and Man Utd and the Kroenke family at Arsenal.

A statement from Boehly read: “We are honoured to become the new custodians of Chelsea Football Club.

""We’re all in – 100% -- every minute of every match. Our vision as owners is clear: we want to make the fans proud.

""Along with our commitment to developing the youth squad and acquiring the best talent our plan of action is to invest in the Club for the long-term and build on Chelsea’s remarkable history of success.

""I personally want to thank ministers and officials in the British government and the Premier League for all their work in making this happen.”

And in his first match at Stamford Bridge as owner Boehly looked very invested in proceedings as he attended with his wife Katie.

DCM Data Products though a part of a large industrial group operated like a startup from a garage and spawned new firms most notably Hindustan Computers Limited (HCL) founded by Shiv Nadar and others. Narendra Patni who conceived the idea of shipping data conversion work from America to India in what later came to be recognised as offshoring founded Patni Computer Systems which in turn nurtured a group of young programmers led by N R Narayana Murthy. This group broke off and formed Infosys. Azim Premji scion of the Western India Products Limited branched off to form Wipro Information Technology Limited which was incubated at the Indian Institute of Science. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) expanded its business with the Tatas also teaming with Burroughs. All these firms benefited from the vast Indian market which was looking to shift from mainframes and data processing to mini and microcomputers after the exit of IBM in 1978. Software services exports in the form of on-site development also began in a modest way by the end of the 1970s.

Photo by Reuters

Oil prices dropped for a second session on Monday after the head of the world's top exporter Saudi Aramco said it is ready to ramp up output while production at several offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico platforms is resuming after a brief outage last week.

Brent crude futures fell 27 cents or 0.3% to $97.88 a barrel by 0034 GMT after settling 1.5% lower on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $91.87 a barrel down 22 cents or 0.2% following a 2.4% drop in the previous session.

Saudi Aramco stands ready to raise crude oil output to its maximum capacity of 12 million barrels per day (bpd) if requested to do so by the Saudi Arabian government Chief Executive Amin Nasser told reporters on Sunday.

""We are confident of our ability to ramp up to 12 million bpd any time there is a need or a call from the government or from the ministry of energy to increase our production"" Nasser said. He added that China's easing of Covid-19 restrictions and a pickup in the aviation industry could add to demand.

Investors are looking ahead to China economic data later on Monday for demand cues at the world's top crude oil importer.

Oil prices rebounded more than 3% last week after a damaged oil pipeline component disrupted output at several offshore Gulf of Mexico platforms.

Producers had moved to reactivate some of the halted production after repairs were completed late Friday a Louisiana official said.

Energy services firm Baker Hughes Co reported on Friday that U.S. oil rig count rose by 3 to 601 last week. The rig count an early indicator of future output has been slow to grow with oil production only seen recovering from pandemic-related cuts next year.

Global oil markets remained supported by tight supplies in the run-up to EU sanctions on Russian crude oil and refined product supplies this winter.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Roughly one in ten people who moved to Israel from the United States — 333 out of 3480 — made their first home in the West Bank. This compared to the 2.6 percent who did the same from France 1.7% from Russia and 1.6% from Ukraine.

On average 3.2% of all new immigrants including Americans move to settlements upon arriving in the country.

The 333 American immigrants who moved to settlements represent a major increase in real numbers over previous years; in 2020 fewer than 200 American immigrants moved to settlements. But that is due to an overall rise in immigration to Israel from the US in 2021 not a change in the overall trend.

Last year was a banner year for immigration to Israel from the US with some 4000 people making the move the highest number since 1973 according to the Immigration and Absorption Ministry. This was in part due to a backlog created the year before because of the coronavirus pandemic. The ministry counted more arrivals as immigrants than the CBS because it uses slightly different criteria to determine who qualifies as a new immigrant.

Yet the share of new American immigrants moving to settlements has remained relatively consistent over the past decade or so with roughly 10-15% ultimately opting to move to the West Bank according to Sarah Hirschorn associate professor of Israel studies at Northwestern University who has extensively researched the role of American Jews in the settlement enterprise.

“The percentage moving to settlements — we don’t know the exact number — that’s been very consistent over the past decade” Hirschorn said.

The precise number is not clear as the Central Bureau of Statistics is able to track the first place where new immigrants chose to settle not where they ultimately end up. So if a family immediately arrives in Jerusalem but then moves to the Neve Daniel settlement after a few months this would not appear in the CBS figures.

In her book “City on a Hilltop: American Jews and the Israeli Settler Movement” Hirschorn estimates that American citizens represent 15% of the overall settlement population a significantly disproportionate figure based on a variety of data sources. Less than 200000 US citizens are estimated to live in Israel or roughly 2.2% of the total Israeli population.

Hirschorn attributes this inflated presence of American Jews in the West Bank to a combination of ideology and the natural draw of the settlements to English-speaking religious immigrants.

Immigration to Israel or aliyah from the US is overwhelmingly a matter of personal preference. Unlike Russian Jews escaping an increasingly totalitarian regime or French Jews fleeing antisemitism American Jews are running to Israel not away from the US.

“American aliyah — despite the current rise in antisemitism — is still an aliyah of choice. The French and Russians are trying to get the hell out of dodge because they perceive a threat” Hirschorn said.

The majority of the American Jews making that choice are Orthodox a group that is more likely to support the settlement enterprise she said.

“Living in settlements has become normalized within the Orthodox community in the United States. The political nature of that act has become erased or at least toned down” Hirschorn said.

Alongside these ideological drives there are also practical motivations drawing American immigrants to settlements.

“It’s familiar to many Americans. Just like Jerusalem is full of anglos” — the commonly used term for English-speaking Israelis — “so is Efrat and Neve Daniel” she said referring to two settlements popular with American immigrants in the Etzion bloc outside Jerusalem.

Indeed while roughly 10% of American immigrants move to settlements a full half move to Jerusalem compared to 21.7% of French immigrants and 3.4% of Russians in 2021.

Settlements in the Etzion bloc offer American immigrants a chance to live just outside of Jerusalem — a 25-minute drive to the center of the city without traffic — in a suburban setting.

“Most of these Americans are going to nice neighborhoods with family homes or large apartments that are on the level of what they might have had in the US” Hirschorn said.

The existing outsized number of American citizens living in settlements perpetuates itself as immigrants tend to seek out fellow countrymen to ease their transition into a new country. It also explains why immigrants from other countries even people who may politically support settlements are more likely to settle elsewhere.

“Immigrants tend to surround themselves with other kinfolk until they integrate into society” Hirschorn said. “For French and Russian Jews that’s not the settlements.”

French Russian and Ukrainian immigrants tend to move to cities with already large expat populations.

For French immigrants this means the coastal city of Netanya where roughly a third of them wound up in 2021 and Tel Aviv where a quarter did. Russian and Ukrainian immigrants spread out more evenly between Tel Aviv Haifa and the central southern and northern districts according to the CBS figures."

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Most have yet to implement an official remote-only or in-person-only strategy instead easing hesitant workers back into the office with a hybrid policy. But many have been operating in a tale of two cities forcing retail workers back to the frontlines a year before requiring corporate employees to return to the office.

From Walmart to Amazon here’s a breakdown of the top 10 Fortune 500’s return-to-office policies.

1. Walmart

Walmart’s retail workers referred to as in-house associates worked through the pandemic while its corporate workers worked from home for over a year. Walmart released a company memo in October 2021 stating that corporate employees would transition to coming into the office on a “more regular basis” in November.

But Walmart’s 10000 tech employees were excluded from the decision; the company announced in May 2020 that this largely Silicon Valley-based group could work remotely indefinitely as the pandemic waned.

A spokesperson for the company tells Fortune campus-office associates have been coming into the office more regularly since February. In a February email Walmart provided to Fortune Donna Morris chief people officer said it’s the company’s intention to create a collaborative environment on campus while working toward more flexibility.

“Our ways of working will vary across teams” she wrote. “We believe it’s important that we aren’t overly prescriptive and in the nature of flexibility we all need to be open to ambiguity. We will not mandate in and out of office days or start and finish times.”

She left it open to bosses to decide what meetings can be attended in-person and on-campus but added that the company believes “it’s important to be together in our offices the majority of the time” writing that Walmart’s culture leadership relationship building and creativity all benefit when workers are together.

2. Amazon

Amazon delivery and warehouse workers continued to provide goods throughout lockdown reportedly dealing with grueling conditions while corporate employees worked from home. In October 2021 Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained in a company memo that Amazon continues to be in “a stage of experimenting learning and adjusting for a while as we emerge from this pandemic.”

In said company memo which Amazon referred Fortune to when asked for comment Jassy allows directors on individual teams to decide how many days their reports should come into the office. Jassy maintained that the company is flexible but that Amazon workers should live close enough to their office to come in within a day’s notice.

In September Jassy made it clear that Amazon isn’t looking to push an office mandate any time soon. “We don’t have a plan to require people to come back. We don’t right now. But we’re going to proceed adaptively as we learn” he said.

3. Apple

CEO Tim Cook has pushed corporate employees slowly back to the office under a hybrid model.

“For many of you I know that returning to the office represents a long-awaited milestone and a positive sign that we can engage more fully with the colleagues who play such an important role in our lives” Cook said. “For others it may also be an unsettling change.”

Employees were asked to come into the office beginning April 11th reaching a minimum of three in-person days by March 23rd. Many employees (about 76%) were dissatisfied and 56% reported that they were looking to quit.

Though Cook’s previous plans were thwarted by another round of COVID-19 infections Apple recently announced employees should save the date to come in three times a week starting September 5th.

Meanwhile Apple retail employees have been unionizing for better working conditions. It’s working: Apple agreed to make work schedules at all of its retail stores more flexible.

Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

4. CVS Health

Many pharmacists and other retail workers stayed in stores during the pandemic to take care of customers’ increasing medical needs says Erin Britt director of corporate communications at CVS Health.

Corporate employees were ushered back to the office starting March 15th. “As part of our new hybrid work format most corporate employees are spending two to three days each week at one of our office locations and working virtually on the other days” Britt tells Fortune.

5. UnitedHealth Group

UnitedHealth Group has implemented all three work models: “hybrid fully telecommute and core on-site” with an emphasis on flexible work according to an official statement the company sent Fortune.

The healthcare and insurance company pointed out that they’ve always had both remote and on-site employees but the bulk of workers right now are mostly hybrid.

“The hybrid model will apply to many of our traditionally office-based employees who will now average about three days per week in the office” reads the statement. “The hybrid model is flexible and based on manager discretion.”

6. Exxon Mobil

On-site employees seemingly remained working in person through the pandemic; in March 2020 an article on the company’s site read “For those employees whose work requires them to be at one of our facilities we have put additional safety measures in place.”

Employees based in Houston (where Exxon plans to move its headquarters to next year) were expected to return to office five days a week starting mid-May of 2021 according to Bloomberg.

“Most of our Houston-campus employees are back in the office while continuing to benefit from our workplace flexibility programs” Todd Spitler Corporate Media Relations Senior Advisor tells Fortune. He adds that while the company believes that “business is best run from our offices and workplaces” there are workforce flexibility programs that can be approved by a supervisor.

7. Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett was one of the first leaders to publicly question if people would ever return to the office after the pandemic. Charlie Munger vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway continued Buffett’s sentiment in February 2022 saying that a large portion of workers who would rather not be in the office would remain that way forever.

There’s no public official statement on the company’s policy but when Fortune called headquarters an administrative worker revealed that each branch is making its own decisions with HR on whether employees will return to office.

8. Alphabet

Alphabet’s subsidiary Google is bringing corporate workers back to headquarters on a hybrid schedule.

Google’s corporate employees were expected to return to the office three days a week starting April 2022. A representative informed Fortune that the decision was made in light of employee feedback. But there’s still room for flexibility as “employees who need more time before returning can also request a work-from-home extension.”

Feedback on the corporate roll-out of return to office varied based on the employee but the company has received backlash for its pay adjustments based on where remote workers are located.

But Google’s extended workforce—which includes vendors and temporary staff who work on short-term projects—was compensated for time spent off explains a representative to Fortune: “Throughout the pandemic members of our extended workforce who were affected by reduced office schedules and closures were compensated for the time they would have worked.”

9. McKesson

McKesson’s frontline healthcare workers continued to work during the pandemic. “During the midst of a pandemic thousands of Team McKesson members continue to work every day in order to deliver vital medical products to the frontline in the fight against COVID-19” its website reads.

An Indeed poll of about 4000 McKesson employees found that 61% said they could work remotely. As of now the company has advertised both remote and in-person positions. Reviews on Glassdoor from employees emphasize the company’s flexibility; one from March 2022 says “employs an office as a destination approach where you go to the office to collaborate but perform your duties remotely.”

McKesson did not respond to requests for comment.

10. AmerisourceBergen

The drug wholesale company is “working under a hybrid model called the ‘Work Smart Platform’ meaning that team members are encouraged to work from home and come into the office when they desire” spokeswoman Mackenzie Liberatori told The Mercury in October 2021.

AmerisourceBergen didn’t provide Fortune with details on its return-to-office policies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzE0LzMtY29tcGFuaWVzLXRoYXQtY291bGQtYmUtd29ydGgtMS10cmlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDMyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Companies That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion by 2032,"Buying these stocks today could be a rewarding move in 10 years.

At the time of writing Apple Microsoft Alphabet and Amazon are the only four U.S. companies with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or greater. Tesla is not far behind with a market cap of $907 million.

These are elite businesses that have earned shareholders tremendous gains. It goes without saying that these companies all had much smaller market caps not too long ago. Amazon's market cap was $105 billion exactly 10 years ago.

Generally a good place to look for the next home-run stocks are growing companies with a market cap between $100 billion to $500 billion. But in this case let's first look at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) which has a higher market cap but could be a timely buy right now.

For higher return prospects you'll want to consider Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.31%) and Salesforce (CRM 0.55%). These are solid growth stories that still have years to play out.

1. Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway is one of the safest stocks you can hold for the long term. After rising 50% over the last five years it carries a market cap of $653 billion. That puts it within shooting distance of the $1 trillion milestone. There are a few reasons Berkshire will keep growing in value.

Berkshire has a sterling balance sheet with $122 billion of cash and fixed securities. The company has a large stock portfolio worth $327 billion at the end of the second quarter. Buffett's investment vehicle holds large stakes in Apple Bank of America and Coca-Cola among other stocks. Buffett has most recently been adding to large stakes in Chevron Occidental Petroleum and leading PC brand HP (formerly Hewlett-Packard).

Another piece of Berkshire's intrinsic value is its dozens of privately held businesses. The company's subsidiaries span everything from candy to railroads. It also owns several insurance companies that provide $147 billion in float or money that Berkshire collects from insurance premiums that it can reinvest in stocks bonds or acquisitions. Many of these Berkshire-held businesses tend to be immune from the changes in technology which adds a degree of predictability to their long-term performance -- something Buffett no doubt considered.

One of Buffett's best stock ideas lately has been Berkshire Hathaway itself. Through the first half of 2022 he bought $4 billion worth of the company's shares -- a sign that Buffett sees the stock as undervalued. The stock's price has tripled over the last decade and could repeat that return which would push Berkshire's market cap over $1 trillion by 2032.

2. Advanced Micro Devices

Owning companies that serve megatrends in technology such as spending on data centers cloud computing and other advanced computing needs could pay off big. Advanced Micro Devices has emerged as a key supplier of high-performance chips in these markets.

AMD currently sports a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23 based on 2022 earnings estimates and has a market cap of $159 billion. To reach $1 trillion in 10 years the share price needs to climb at a compound annual rate of 20%. That is achievable for this fast-growing chipmaker.

For a long time AMD was the underdog in the semiconductor industry. It's always played the role of a low-cost alternative to leaders like Intel and Nvidia but not anymore.

While AMD is still way behind Intel in central processing units (CPUs) and Nvidia in graphics processing units (GPUs) it is winning over customers with its renewed focus on designing high-performance chips. Data center operators are now looking at AMD's Epyc server chips as a viable alternative to Intel. In the last quarter AMD again gained market share over its CPU rival. Revenue grew 70% year over year in the second quarter driven by strong growth in data center chips and consumer chips for notebooks and gaming.

The data center accelerator market which includes spending on CPUs and GPUs is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 34% through 2027 reaching $75 billion. AMD just completed the acquisition of Xilinx a leading supplier of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips which fills out its product lineup to tackle this enormous opportunity. The strong tailwind in the data center market along with AMD's modest valuation could deliver market-beating returns to investors over the long term.

There is a reason why AMD CEO Lisa Su is considered one of the top business leaders right now. Su has done a marvelous job guiding this underdog to industry leadership and its best days are still ahead.

3. Salesforce

The name Salesforce doesn't sound like a growth tech stock that is worthy of the elite club of $1 trillion companies but every investor should know about this amazing business.

Former Oracle executive Marc Benioff co-founded Salesforce in 1999 and currently serves as the company's chairman and co-CEO. Salesforce pioneered the software-as-a-service business model. Companies save money by subscribing to Salesforce's cloud-based software which lowers in-house expenses by maintaining installing and keeping systems updated.

Salesforce has grown tremendously and has been ranked the No. 1 customer relationship management (CRM) software provider for nine years. Its flagship product is the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Customer 360 platform which offers a suite of software that helps companies manage sales marketing and e-commerce and it continues to expand into new categories.

It has reinvested its growing profitability into strategic acquisitions that expand its offering and competitive lead in the market. Last year it acquired Slack Technologies which offers a communication platform for employees for $27 billion.

What's most remarkable about Salesforce is its consistency which speaks volumes about the size of its long-term growth opportunity. After two decades of high revenue growth Salesforce is still growing quarterly revenue over 20% year over year.

It generated $27 billion in revenue over the last four quarters but the total addressable market for the company's services is expected to reach $284 billion by 2026 according to Gartner Research.

Why Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Was Called ‘India’s Warren Buffett’

Why Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Was Called ‘India’s Warren Buffett’

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala the self-made stock-market king who passed away aged 62 was dubbed as 'India's Warren Buffett'.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala was often referred to as ""India's Warren Buffett"" due to their long term investment methods.

New Delhi: Rakesh Jhunjhunwala the self-made stock-market king passed away at the age of 62 after suffering from multiple health issues. The veteran investor whose net worth was $5.8 Billion was often called “India’s Warren Buffett” in reference to the American investor-god and philanthropist. On being referred to as ‘India’s Warren Buffet’ Rakesh Jhunjhunwala once said that the Berkshire Hathaway CEO was “far far ahead” of him. “I am not a clone of anybody. I am Rakesh Jhunjhunwala” Rakesh Jhunjhunwala told Reuters in an interview.

Why Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Was Dubbed As ‘India’s Warren Buffett’

Warren Buffett one of the biggest investors and business magnates of United States and current CEO of Birkshire Hathaway is often referred to as “Oracle of Omaha”. As his Indian counterpart Rakesh Jhunjhunwala came to be known as “Oracle of Dalal Street”. The similarity between the two mavericks was that they both had midas touch the acute ability to gauge market changes and invest accordingly. Prices of share would rise the minute these pioneers would buy them. The Indian bull though was one of the first generation of investors who benefitted from the 1991 liberal reforms.

In 1985 at the age of 25 Rakesh Jhunjhunwala bought his very first shares that of Tata Tea at Rs. 43 per share and within three months the price rose to Rs. 143 per share. Warren Buffett owned his first share when he was 11 years old and filed his first tax at the age of 13.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala owned a long list of companies including Tata group’s Titan Company Ltd. Titan’s stock is the biggest holding in Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s name in terms of amount. Warren Buffett too runs Berkshire Hathaway which owns dozens of companies including insurer Geico battery maker Duracell and restaurant chain Dairy Queen.

Big bull also owned Tata Motors Indian Hotels Geojit Financial Services and had recently listed his own firm Star Health and allied insurance on the stock exchanges.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala had also ventured into the aviation space this month with Akasa Air taking its first flight.

Buffett’s father was a US Congressman whereas Jhunjhunwala was the son of a Incom Tax Commissioner.

The greatest similarity between the two were their long term investment styles. Both investment magnates gave similar advises when it came to investments:

“Give your investments time to mature. Be Patient for the World to discover your gems” – Rakesh Jhunjhunwala said

“Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” – Warren Buffett

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Warren Buffet – Both champions of their field had advised on keeping patience in investments to enjoy the fully ripened product.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala was the 440th richest person in the world according to Forbes and 38th in India. The investment magnate started his career with a mere sum of Rs 5000 in his pocket. He had recently teamed up with ex-Jet Airways CEO Vinay Dube and former IndiGo head Aditya Ghosh to launch Akasa Air — India’s newest budget carrier. The airline began commercial operations this month with a maiden flight from Mumbai to Ahmedabad.

Best Buy declined to say how many jobs it was cutting but The Wall Street Journal which was first to report the news estimated it involved hundreds of jobs at the store level.

“We’re always evaluating and evolving our teams to make sure we’re serving our customers"" Best Buy said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. 'With an ever-changing macroeconomic environment including customers shopping more digitally than ever we have made adjustments to our teams that include eliminating a small number of roles.”

The job cuts come after Best Buy reduced its annual sales and profit forecast late last month citing surging inflation that has dampened consumer spending on gadgets. The Richfield-based company echoed Walmart which a few days before cut its profit outlook. The nation's largest retailer said that higher prices on basic necessities are forcing shoppers to cut back on discretionary items .

Walmart also announced earlier this month that it was cutting jobs at its corporate headquarters as part of a restructuring effort.

Still the latest snapshot on the overall U.S. job market remains strong even as inflation continues to rage and affect all types of businesses. Last week t he government reported that unemployment dropped another notch from 3.6% to 3.5% matching the more than 50-year low reached just before the pandemic took hold. The economy has now gained back all 22 million jobs lost in March and April 2020 when COVID-19 hit the U.S.

Best Buy said last month it now expects this year’s sales at stores opened at least a year to be down 11% much steeper than the 3% to 6% drop it originally forecast in May.

For Best Buy's fiscal second quarter it expects comparable sales to be down 13%. Still revenue for the quarter should be roughly 7.5% higher than the second quarter of 2020 it said.

Best Buy is slated to report its quarterly results on Aug. 30.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA4LzEzL2Jlc3QtYnV5LWlzLWluLXRyb3VibGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Buy Is In Trouble,"Best Buy Is In Trouble Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News via Getty Images

Best Buy the massive consumer electronics retailer is not giving up on retail sales. However it has begun a move to abandon the channel. According to The Wall Street Journal e-commerce sales in particular have moved Best Buy to cut store based jobs.

The problem driven by retailers who cut store jobs is that it begins a flat spin. People who visit stores find customer service is poorer. They go elsewhere. Store sales worsen because people find this store experience troubling. More store based workers have to be fired to maintain margins.



Best Buy has been trapped in the Amazon vise for decades and that has not changed. Amazon the largest e-commerce retailer by far boasts consumer electronics as one of its best selling set of products. Best Buy’s online presence may have grown but it will be permanently crushed by Amazon’s.

Best Buy’s store sales story is ugly. Recently its management said that same store sales would drop 13% in its current fiscal year. Corie Barry Best Buy CEO said: “While our financial results are not where we expected them to be this year our sales continue to be higher than they were pre-pandemic.” The statement does not mean anything to anyone particularly investors.

In the last year Best Buy’s stock is off 32%. That is about the same as big retailer train wreck Target. At the very least if Best Buy’s prospects were reasonable it would have done a bit better.

Very few big box retailers are expected to reverse their fortunes – ever. One final test of whether Best Buy can prove it is on a short list of potential winners is the upcoming holiday season. If its results are poor store personnel cuts are not nearly over.

High energy prices translated to blowout earnings for many energy producers. Though weakness in the commodity space could drag into the end of the year the recent bear market in energy may have already anticipated such a negative trend continuation.

Following such a strong quarter for the energy giants many top energy stocks now have earnings multiples that are even more compressed. Indeed the market doesn’t view the recent energy windfall as sustainable. Still energy prices are historically high paving the way for more impressive cash flows over the medium-to-long term.

With this in mind we’ve used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to check on three high-quality energy stocks – XOM PSX and SHEL – that Wall Street analysts love with a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Let’s take a closer look.

Exxon Mobil (XOM)

Exxon Mobil is a former Warren Buffett favorite that’s been doing incredibly well on a year-to-date basis up 45%. Since peaking out in early June shares of XOM have been a rather bumpy ride plunging just north of 20% before moving slightly higher to $88 and change per share — down just shy of 15% from their peak.

The oil and gas giant crushed analyst estimates for its second quarter with per-share earnings of $4.14 comfortably above the consensus of $3.83. Exxon’s revenue surged nearly 28% quarter-over-quarter (or 71% year-over-year) to $115.7 billion.

Indeed that’s an unprecedented top-line growth bound to slow as oil finds a new (likely lower) range to settle into. Though oil may struggle to stay above $100 per barrel supply constraints due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could continue to keep oil prices well above pre-pandemic levels.

It wasn’t just the favorable energy price environment to thank for Exxon’s incredible blowout result. The company’s cost-reduction program is starting to pay dividends and the recent production increase proved well-timed.

With stellar fundamentals and swelling free cash flows Exxon has the financial flexibility to continue investing in its business while trimming away debt and rewarding shareholders with super-sized dividend hikes.

At writing shares of XOM trade at just 9.7x trailing earnings 1x sales and 6.2x operating cash flow all of which are in line with industry averages.

After clocking in sensational results many Wall Street analysts view Exxon Mobil as a terrific value play. I think they’re right. Currently there are 11 Buys and three Sells on the name. The average price target implies around 23.3% upside potential over the year ahead. Meanwhile the Street-high price target of $125.00 implies 40.5% upside potential from the current price of $88.95 not including the bountiful 3.96% dividend yield.

Philips 66 (PSX)

Philips 66 stock is potentially a great way to play energy refinement. Year-to-date shares of the downstream energy company are up just north of 15% — relatively muted versus the likes of producers like Exxon.

For its latest (second) quarter the firm felt the strong industry winds at its back helping fuel a solid earnings beat ($6.77 versus the $5.95 consensus estimate). Revenue came in at $49.3 billion up around 33% quarter-over-quarter.

Indeed the energy giants are clocking in growth numbers that speculative tech firms posted in the early innings of 2021. Like the tech firms that were bid up last year the euphoric times are unlikely to last. Fortunately for the energy giants investors don’t expect such good times to last. Still their free cash flow windfalls may be underestimated by investors inclined to take profits here following the recent slip in oil prices.

Philips 66 is using its cash windfall to reduce debt and return capital to shareholders. Earlier this year the firm hiked its dividend payout by 5%. Beefed-up share buybacks may also be in the cards as the firm finds itself with enough to spoil shareholders. The company seeks to return around 40% of its cash flows to investors. Pending an oil collapse it seems like PSX shareholders are in for a treat. The dividend currently yields an impressive 4.63%.

The stock trades at a mere 0.3x sales and 7.1x trailing earnings. These numbers especially the former seem indicative of some sort of value trap. Philips 66 appears to be actual value though with a wide moat protecting its economic profits.

Wall Street seems to agree with nine Buys and just one Hold for a $116 price target and 38.4% implied upside potential from PSX’s current price of $83.80. RBC (RY) Capital’s T.J. Schultz is the latest analyst to maintain his Buy rating with a handsome $112.00 price target.

Shell (SHEL)

Shell is a British energy kingpin worth going overseas for the extra value. Like many energy giants Shell saw its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple contract in a big way following the release of its Q2 numbers. The earnings results were good but in line with estimates.

With oil prices on the descent Q2 earnings results had a pretty muted reaction in my opinion. Shell stock is down around 15% from its all-time high of over $60 per share. Though Shell is slightly less sensitive to oil price fluctuations than its peers given its long-term production ramp-down I view Shell as a deep value that’s really hard to ignore.

The stock trades at 5.5 times trailing earnings 0.6 times sales and 3.7 times operating cash flow. That’s bottom-of-the-barrel pricing as far as I’m concerned. With management boosting share buybacks for Q3 after $7.4 billion in dividends and buybacks rewarded to investors in Q2 I think it’s hard to pass up the firm while it continues to enjoy its massive free-cash-flow windfall.

Shell’s windfall won’t last forever; it’s not expected to and Shell has a plan to push forward after energy prices come back down to Earth. With an intriguing power-as-a-service solution to look forward to I view Shell as an excellent fossil fuel firm open to the reality of a sustainable transition.

Wall Street sees real value to be had in Shell stock while it is gushing with free cash flow with three Buys one Hold and a consensus price target of $66.75 implying 28.4% upside potential.

Conclusion

Energy giants have been dealt a terrific hand in recent quarters. Though the windfall won’t last forever many may be underestimating the value to be had at this juncture. I don’t think the low multiples are lying to investors. Of the three stocks analysts seem to be most bullish on PSX stock.

To identify potential new factors involved in GGR we analyzed the interactome of the damage-recognition factor XPC by mass spectrometry. We generated a knockout (KO) of XPC in U2OS (FRT) cells containing an FRT Flp-In integration site. Having confirmed the successful knockout of XPC by sequencing and western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1a) we exploited the site-specific transgene integration of the Flp-In system to re-express XPC-GFP in these cells under a doxycycline-inducible promoter. To demonstrate the functionality of our newly generated cell system we measured the ability to repair UV lesions in unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assays. While the XPC-KO showed a severe repair defect the re-expression XPC-GFP restored the capacity of the cells to repair UV-induced DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. 1b c). Label-free proteomics after pull-down of XPC-GFP revealed several known XPC-binding proteins including RAD23A/B and CEN2/3 as the top interactors (Fig. 1a). After UV irradiation XPC additionally became tightly bound to several GGR factors such as the DDB2 complex (containing DDB1 and CUL4A/B) the TFIIH subunits GTF2H1-4 (p62 p44 p34 p52) XPB (p89/ERCC3) and XPD (p80/ERCC2) (Fig. 1b). This confirms that our label-free proteomics approach is suitable to detect interactions within an active GGR process.

Fig. 1: XPC interacts with PARP1 and PARP2 in a UV-independent manner. a Volcano plot displaying the interactome of XPC-GFP over GFP-NLS after GFP-pull-down from U2OS (FRT) XPC-KO cells and analysis by label-free proteomics. b Differential interactome of XPC-GFP comparing UV-C-irradiated (20 J/m2 1 h) vs. unirradiated U2OS (FRT) XPC-KO cells. a b The dashed lines indicate a twofold enrichment on the x axis (log 2 of 1) and a significance of 0.05 (−log 10 P value of 1.3; two-sided t test) on the y axis. c Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) of GFP-NLS and XPC-GFP in the presence and absence of UV-C (20 J/m2 1 h) and the PARP inhibitor olaparib (10 µM). Three independent replicates of each IP experiment were performed obtaining similar results. Full size image

Interestingly our analysis further identified the poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases PARP1 and PARP2 as strong XPC-associated proteins (Fig. 1a). In contrast to the main GGR factors the interaction between XPC and PARP1/2 was not significantly affected by UV irradiation (Fig. 1b). Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the XPC-PARP1/2 interaction was constitutive and independent of PARylation as treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib did not affect the interactions (Fig. 1c). Our findings indicate that XPC forms a constitutive interaction with both PARP1 and PARP2 which is not affected by DNA damage or PARylation.

XPC and ALC1 interact more strongly with PARP2 than PARP1

To obtain first insights into the role of PARP1 and PARP2 in GGR and the relevance of their interaction with XPC we conducted an orthogonal experiment to identify the interactome of the two PARP enzymes. We stably expressed PARP1-GFP or GFP-PARP2 in U2OS (FRT) cells (Supplementary Fig. 1d) and performed label-free proteomics after GFP-pull-down of the tagged proteins. PARP1 most abundantly interacted with XRCC1-LIG3 and POLB and further showed robust interactions with PARP2 histones as well as the known poly-(ADP-ribose)-binding proteins ALC1 and macroH2A (Fig. 2a). In contrast XPC was not significantly enriched in the PARP1 interactome (Fig. 2a b) which is likely caused by the high abundance of PARP1 and a potentially low stoichiometric interaction with XPC. It should be noted that earlier studies did report an interaction between immunoprecipitated endogenous PARP1 and XPC24.

Three independent replicates of each IP experiment were performed obtaining similar results. Full size image

Interestingly the interactome of PARP2 revealed the poly-(ADP-ribose)-dependent chromatin remodeler ALC1 as its most abundant interactor. PARP2 further interacted with XRCC1-LIG3 PARP1 histones and macroH2A (Fig. 2c). PARP2 also clearly interacted with XPC in a manner that was not affected by UV irradiation (Fig. 2c d). Intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) of protein amounts indicated that ~15% of the isolated PARP2 molecules were associated with ALC1 while only 0.07% of PARP1 molecules interacted with the remodeler. Additionally the fraction of PARP2 molecules associated with XPC was ten-fold higher than for PARP1 (Fig. 2e). The stoichiometry among PARP enzymes was very low with 1.76% of the PARP2 molecules interacting with PARP1 ruling out indirect interactions through PARP heterodimerization. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that PARP2 robustly interacted with both ALC1 and XPC while these interactions were not or only weakly detected after pull-down of PARP1 (Fig. 2f). This demonstrates that XPC and ALC1 both preferentially associate with PARP2 over PARP1 under our experimental conditions.

PARP1/2 recruitment to UV lesions is independent of XPC

The DNA damage-recognition proteins XPC and DDB2 can both bind to UV-induced lesions. DDB2 thereby stimulates XPC recruitment at difficult-to-detect lesions such as CPDs162039 and facilitates lesion-recognition by XPC in a chromatin context. PARP1 was also reported to bind to UV-induced DNA lesions together with XPC2425. Considering the interaction between XPC and PARP1/2 we asked whether the PARP enzymes are recruited to UV lesions and if this is stimulated by XPC. To this end we employed a UV-C (266 nm) laser live-cell imaging set-up in which all optics have been replaced by quartz glass. Local irradiation with UV-C led to the rapid recruitment of PARP1-GFP to sites of DNA damage within seconds after which steady-state bound levels decreased in the first several minutes (Fig. 3a b). GFP-PARP2 was also recruited to UV-C laser damage. Steady-state bound levels remained high for ~10 min without an apparent decrease (Fig. 3c d). The enrichment of PARP1-GFP shortly after UV-C micro-irradiation was more pronounced (1.4-fold) compared to the more modest recruitment of PARP2-GFP (1.2-fold). Interestingly the recruitment kinetics of PARP1 and PARP2 were identical in XPC-KO cells (Fig. 3b d). This indicates that PARP enzymes accumulate independently of XPC at sites of UV-induced DNA damage which is in line with earlier findings showing that PARP1 recruitment is similar between WT and XPC-deficient cells at 10 min after UV irradiation24.

Fig. 3: PARP1/2 recruitment to UV lesions is independent of XPC. a c Representative images of a PARP1-GFP and c GFP-PARP2 association with sites of local UV-C laser irradiation in U2OS (FRT) WT and XPC-KO cells at 30 sec and 10 min post-irradiation. b d Kinetics of the recruitment of b PARP1-GFP and d GFP-PARP2 to and dissociation from UV-C lesions measured over 10 min in U2OS (FRT) WT and XPC-KO cells; 70–91 nuclei were analyzed in three independent biological replicates. The data are shown as mean + SEM normalized to pre-damage GFP intensity at micro-irradiation sites. e Representative images and f quantification of XPC colocalization with local UV-C irradiation sites (100 J/m2) marked by CPD measured 10 min post-irradiation. In all 58–230 cells were analyzed per condition. All cells are depicted as individual data points (gray). The medians of four biological replicates are depicted as colored points while the bar represents the median of all data points. The scale bar in a c e is 5 µm. Full size image

Deletion of either PARP1 or PARP2 had a minor impact on the recruitment of XPC to UV lesions as measured by immunofluorescence after local UV irradiation through micropore filters (Fig. 3e f). The impact of PARP enzymes was milder than KO of DDB2 which led to considerably reduced XPC recruitment as reported previously162039. Our data thus suggest that XPC and PARP enzymes are recruited to DNA lesions largely independently although PARP enzymes may stimulate XPC recruitment under certain conditions such as low doses of DNA damage2024.

XPC stimulates the poly-(ADP-ribose) response to UV lesions

The PARP response involves the rapid and robust DNA damage-induced PARylation mainly of PARP1 itself but also of other chromatin substrates40. To better understand how the PARP response modulates GGR we measured nuclear PAR levels at sites of local UV-induced DNA damage by immunofluorescence in PARP1-KO and PARP2-KO cells (Fig. 4a b). PARylation strongly increased at sites of local UV irradiation marked by DDB2 recruitment in WT cells and PARP2-KO cells but not in PARP1-KO cells (Figs. 4a b; Supplementary Fig. 2a). Similarly nuclear PAR levels also increased after global UV irradiation in a manner that was dependent on PARP1 but not on PARP2 (Fig. 4c d; Supplementary Fig. 2b). This demonstrates that the PAR response at UV lesions is largely dependent on PARP1 as demonstrated for other DNA-damaging agents29414243.

Having established that XPC interacts with PARP1 and PARP2 (Figs. 1 and 2) we sought to investigate whether XPC impacts the PAR response. Strikingly XPC-KO cells showed an attenuated PAR response at sites of local UV damage while DDB2-KO cells established PAR levels similar to wild-type U2OS cells (Fig. 4e–h; Supplementary Fig. 2c d). Identical results were obtained when PAR levels were monitored after global UV irradiation (Figs. 4i j; Supplementary Fig. 2e). Knockdown of XPA in XPC-deficient cells did not further reduce DNA damage-induced PARylation at sites of local UV-induced DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. 2f–i) suggesting that this phenomenon is dependent on GGR and not on transcription-coupled repair. To understand whether XPC may directly stimulate the activity of PARP enzymes through their interaction we performed in vitro PARylation assays using recombinant PARP1 in the presence of UV-irradiated DNA and increasing amounts of recombinant XPC-RAD23B complex (Fig. 4k l). In this minimal in vitro system without additional components we observed that XPC directly stimulated the catalytic activity of PARP1 by ~1.5 fold which was already observed at a 4:1 ratio of PARP1 over XPC-RAD23B complex and did not increase when more XPC was added to the reaction (Fig. 4k l). These findings show that XPC stimulates the initial and rapid PAR response at UV lesions by enhancing the protein activity of PARP1.

PARP1 and ALC1 are UV-induced substrates of PARylation

Based on the close interaction of XPC and PARP1/2 we next asked which of these proteins become PARylated upon UV damage. To this end we performed pull-down experiments under high-salt conditions to disrupt protein-protein interactions and capture the PARylation status of the immunoprecipitated proteins. Pull-down of PARP1-GFP revealed robust PARylation in response to UV irradiation (Fig. 5a). By contrast GFP-PARP2 and XPC-GFP were already PARylated in control cells at lower levels with no further increase following UV irradiation (Fig. 5b c). The poly-(ADP-ribose)-dependent chromatin remodeler ALC1 was also strongly PARylated in response to UV irradiation (Fig. 5d).

Additional representative images are found in Fig. S3a. The scale bar in e is 5 µm. Full size image

To better capture the dynamics of protein PARylation in response to UV irradiation we performed an adapted LacO-based colocalization assay in which we fused the PAR-binding macrodomain of macroH2A1.1 to LacR and tethered this PAR-binding module to a LacO array in U2OS 263 cells4445. We then induced the PARylation response by local irradiation with a 266 nm UV-C laser. Micro-irradiation triggered the recruitment of GFP-tagged versions of XPC ALC1 PARP1 and PARP2 to sites of UV-C-induced laser damage (Figs. 5e f and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Within one minute following irradiation we also detected the capture of XPC ALC1 and PARP1 at the LacO array bound by the LacR-fused macrodomain PAR-binding module. This suggests that protein complexes containing XPC ALC1 and PARP1 become PARylated at laser micro-irradiation sites and dissociate from these sites in a modified PARylated state which in turn allows their interaction with the immobilized macrodomain at the LacO array. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib prevented the accumulation of XPC at the LacO site demonstrating that its capture at the LacO array is fully dependent on PARylation (Fig. 5e f). Interestingly PARP2 was recruited to UV sites but could not be detected at the LacO site following micro-irradiation suggesting that its UV-induced PARylation is not sufficiently high or that the protein is not sufficiently mobile to enable capture of PARP2 by the immobilized PAR-binding module at the LacO array.

The capture of either PARP1 or ALC1 at the immobilized PAR-binding module is consistent with their UV-induced PARylation detected in pull-down experiments (Fig. 5a d). In contrast XPC is captured by the immobilized PAR-binding module but we could not detect UV-induced PARylation of XPC following immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5c). This means that either the capture of XPC at the immobilized PAR-binding module is mediated indirectly through its interaction with PARP1 which is heavily PARylated after UV (Fig. 5a). Alternatively XPC may undergo a conformational change at sites of DNA damage that results in the exposure of its PARylated residues and its UV-induced capture at the immobilized PAR-binding module. Either way our data indicate that the PARP1-XPC complex and chromatin remodeler ALC1 become robustly PARylated at sites of UV-induced DNA damage.

PARP1 and PARP2 protect against UV-induced DNA damage

To establish the relevance of PARP1 and PARP2 in UV damage repair we first assayed PARP1-KO and PARP2-KO cells for UV sensitivity. Western blot analysis confirmed the knockout of PARP1 or PARP2 using specific antibodies (Fig. 6a). Clonogenic survival assays showed that KO of either PARP1 or PARP2 conferred sensitivity to UV irradiation in human cells (Fig. 6b). The siRNA-mediated knockdown of XPC which was confirmed by western blot analysis caused similar sensitivities in wild-type and PARP-deficient cells suggesting that the PARP enzymes cause UV sensitivity mainly through the GGR pathway (Supplementary Fig. 3b c). To further validate these findings we performed CPD dot blot assays in PARP1-KO and PARP2-KO cells. To this end genomic DNA was isolated from cells at varying time points after UV-C irradiation to determine the amount of remaining UV-induced photoproduct. This approach revealed that both PARP1-KO and PARP2-KO cells displayed delayed CPD repair (Supplementary Fig. 3d e).

Full size image

To extend the biological relevance of these findings we asked whether the role of PARP1 and PARP2 in protecting against UV irradiation is evolutionarily conserved in an animal model. We obtained PARP1-deficient (ok988) and PARP2-deficient (ok344) C. elegans (Fig. 6c) and performed germ cell and embryo survival assays after UV irradiation which specifically monitor GGR46. Deletion of either PARP1 or PARP2 strongly sensitized nematodes to UV-B light compared to WT animals (Fig. 6d). Interestingly animals containing a double knockout for XPC (tm3886) and either PARP1 (ok988) or PARP2 (ok344) were as sensitive to UV-B irradiation as single XPC-deficient nematodes (Fig. 6e). These findings indicate evolutionary conservation of the involvement of both PARP enzymes in GGR.

ALC1 is recruited to UV lesions by XPC

Our proteomics analyses revealed that XPC binds more robustly to PARP2 than PARP1 and that ALC1 is an abundant interactor of PARP2 (Fig. 2). Moreover ALC1 was robustly PARylated in response to UV irradiation (Fig. 5d). To better understand the links between XPC PARP enzymes poly-(ADP-ribose)-responses and ALC1 in GGR we profiled the ALC1 interactome dissected the role of its PAR-binding macrodomain and ATPase activity as well as measured the UV-C-dependent recruitment dynamics of ALC1. We therefore generated ALC1-KO cells in U2OS (FRT) and stably re-expressed GFP-tagged versions of ALC1 (WT ATPase-dead; E175Q and PAR-binding-deficient; Δmacrodomain; Supplementary Fig. 4a). Label-free proteomics after GFP-ALC1 pull-down confirmed a strong interaction of wild-type ALC1 with PARP2 PARP1 the FACT subunit SPT16 and core histones (Fig. 7a). In contrast the ATPase-dead version of ALC1 interacted less with PARP2 and core histones suggesting that the ATPase activity of ALC1 impacts the association of the enzyme with PARP2 (Fig. 7b). Consistently immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that ALC1 robustly bound PARP2 and to a lesser extent PARP1 and that these interactions were decreased with ALC1 E175Q (Fig. 7c). Moreover an ALC1 Δmacrodomain mutant showed a completely disrupted interaction with PARP1/2.

The data are shown as mean + SEM normalized to pre-damage GFP intensity at micro-irradiation sites. The scale bar in d f is 5 µm. Full size image

Next we tested the recruitment of ALC1 to UV-C DNA damage sites. Local UV-C laser irradiation experiments showed that GFP-ALC1 was rapidly recruited with similar kinetics as PARP1 independently of its ATPase activity as the WT and E175Q versions of ALC1 showed similar association kinetics (Fig. 7d e). However the ATPase mutant remained at UV-damaged sites for longer times. The macrodomain deletion mutant failed to recruit (Fig. 7d e). Our data suggest that the chromatin remodeler ALC1 is tightly linked to the poly-(ADP-ribose) response to UV lesions. The PAR-dependent recruitment of ALC1 via its macrodomain leads to a robust interaction with chromatin which is then followed by ATP hydrolysis and localized chromatin remodeling. In turn ATP hydrolysis by ALC1 results in the displacement and dissociation of the ALC1 chromatin remodeler from UV-damaged chromatin.

Further the recruitment of ALC was fully impaired in PARP1-deficient cells while its recruitment still occurred in PARP2-deficient cells albeit with distinct kinetics (Supplementary Fig. 4b c). This suggests that PARP2 may modulate ALC1 association dynamics. Strikingly we also observed a strongly decreased recruitment of ALC1 in XPC-KO cells while the recruitment of ALC1 in DDB2-KO cells was similar to WT (Fig. 7f g). Our data indicate that the GGR-initiator protein XPC stimulates the recruitment of chromatin remodeler ALC1 to sites of UV-induced DNA damage suggesting that the XPC-mediated stimulation of the poly-(ADP-ribose) response promotes PAR-dependent downstream processes such as ALC1-mediated chromatin remodeling.

ALC1 stimulates the clearing of genomic UV lesions

To directly assess the relevance of ALC1 in UV damage repair we performed slot blot assays to monitor 6-4PP and CPD levels in ALC1-KO cells. Deletion of the chromatin remodeler ALC1 resulted in a delayed repair of 6-4PPs (Fig. 8a; S5a) and a strong repair defect of CPD lesions (Fig. 8b; Supplementary 5b) compared to XPC-KO cells. Interestingly the deletion of ALC1 did not affect the transcription-coupled sub-pathway of NER as ALC1-KO cells were not sensitive to the drug Illudin S in clonogenic survival assays and did not impact the recovery of RNA synthesis after UV damage as measured by 5-EU incorporation (Supplementary Fig. 5c–e). Our data suggest that ALC1 specifically acts in GGR.

The ATPase activity of ALC1 stimulates XPC-dependent DNA repair

Having found that XPC stimulates the recruitment of ALC1 to repair sites we wanted to understand how ALC1-mediated chromatin remodeling affects UV damage repair. Loss ALC1 did not affect the recruitment of XPC or DDB2 following UV-C laser irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 6a b) suggesting that XPC and DDB2 binding precedes ALC1 recruitment and that ALC1 does not affect the lesion-recognition step of GGR. Importantly clonogenic UV survival experiments revealed that the knockout of ALC1 rendered cells sensitive to UV irradiation to a similar extent as DDB2-KO cells (Fig. 8c). Re-expression of ALC1 WT but not the ATPase-dead or PAR-binding-deficient ALC1 mutants rescued both UV-sensitivity phenotype (Fig. 8d) and unscheduled DNA synthesis at UV sites of ALC1-KO cells (Fig. 8e f). These data indicate that active ALC1-catalyzed chromatin remodeling plays an important role in UV repair.

To directly monitor UV-induced chromatin changes induced by PARP1/2 and the ALC1 chromatin remodeler we sequentially irradiated cells expressing photoactivatable GFP fused to histone H2A (PAGFP-H2A) with a UV-C laser (266 nm) to generate UV-specific photolesions immediately followed by UV-A laser (355 nm) irradiation to activate PAGFP-H2A specifically at sites of local UV damage (Fig. 9a). Control experiments showed that UV-A laser irradiation alone activated PAGFP-H2A but failed to recruit the GGR protein DDB2-mCherry whereas sequential irradiation with UV-C and UV-A lasers triggered DDB2-mCherry recruitment and locally activated PAGFP-H2A (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Importantly combined irradiation with UV-C and UV-A lasers failed to recruit the double-strand break repair protein NBS1-mCherry at sites that did show local activation of PAGFP-H2A (Supplementary Fig. 6d). This shows that UV-C/UV-A laser irradiation without BrdU sensitization does not cause the substantial formation of double-strand DNA breaks enabling us to specifically capture chromatin changes at UV-C-induced DNA lesions.

While wild-type and PARP2-KO cells showed considerable expansion of PAGFP-H2A tracks indicative of DNA damage-induced chromatin remodeling following sequential UV-C and UV-A laser irradiation such an expansion was attenuated in either PARP1-KO or ALC1-KO cells. These findings reveal that chromatin expansion at sites of UV-C-induced DNA damage is stimulated by PARP1-dependent and ALC1-mediated chromatin remodeling (Fig. 9a b).

Loss of ALC1 catalytic activity leads to a hyper-PAR response at UV lesions

Our previous work revealed that cells mount a hyper-PAR response to single-stranded DNA breaks in the absence of ALC1 resulting in the trapping of PARP2 at these structures47. Having shown that ALC1’s catalytic activity is required for chromatin expansion at sites of UV lesions and efficient GGR we wondered whether the loss of ALC1 could also affect the PAR response to UV lesions.

To monitor the PAR response we locally irradiated cells with UV-C light and fixed cells at different time points after irradiation. Wild-type cells showed a clear PAR signal at sites of UV-induced lesions marked by the local enrichment of XPC (Supplementary Fig. 6e) which was similar between all time points examined (Fig. 9c d). In contrast ALC1-KO cells initially mounted a similar PAR response shortly after UV irradiation but PAR levels steadily increased over time to ~2-fold higher levels at 30 min compared to wild-type cells (Fig. 9c d). This hyper-PAR response could be fully rescued by expression of ALC1WT while expression of ATPase inactive ALC1 E175Q even further increased PAR levels to ~3-fold over wild-type cells (Fig. 9c d). These findings show that the catalytic activity of ALC1 is required to shut off the PAR response at UV lesions. Altogether these findings demonstrate that both the recruitment of the chromatin remodeler ALC1 to PAR chains and its ability to function as an ATP-driven chromatin remodeler is critical for UV repair.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The world’s largest asset manager Blackrock said it was encouraged by blockchain projects focused on energy efficiency. It mentioned Energy Web the company behind EWT token which saw huge spike in the last few days. Surprisingly the token was not very well known until Blackrock’s announcement.

Blackrock Behind EWT Token Price Rise

Blackrock said it was looking at projects which are tapping renewable energy related Bitcoin mining operations. Despite a market downturn the company said it saw “huge interest in cryptocurrencies” from some of its institutional clients. The Blackrock Bitcoin trust would track the performance and expenses of Bitcoin operations while serving U.S. based clients.

BlackRock said it was encouraged that organizations like Energy Web are developing programs to bring greater transparency to sustainable energy usage. The company said it would follow progress around transparency in energy use for Bitcoin mining. More importantly the mention of EWT token in the announcement brought huge interest in the altcoin. With a space of few hours the token rose by as much as 40% catapulting EWT from rank of 262 to under 200.

From trading at $2.67 on Thursday to surpassing $4 the token reached a high of $4.44 at one point in time. As of writing EWT is trading at $4.01 up 2.13% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap.

No Whales Holding EWT

In an interesting insight no big whales accumulated the Energy Web token even after the Blackrock announcement. According to findings of Santiment the largest holder of EWT holds the asset worth just above $200000. The biggest holder is Gate.io exchange currently with EWT worth of around $0.2 million it said.

“The Energy Web Token jumped 50% to a high of $4.17 after it was mentioned in a BlackRock press release. There are no millionaire EWT holders at all.”

The EWT token is used to pay for gas fees on the network which was designed for use in the energy sector.

In October 2021 the parent company of the world’s most popular social media platform decided to change its name from Facebook (FB) to Meta Platforms (META) as part of an ongoing shift to the metaverse.

As a result the corporation created a new business unit called the “Reality Labs” that will be in charge of developing this virtual realm.

META stock shed 62% of its value in 2022 as the compnay grappled with poor financial performance and macro woes. It seems that some of Facebook’s backers have fled the scene in fear that this pivot could threaten to derail the firm’s financial performance in the future.

Who are Facebook shareholders at the moment and why should investors care? In this article we share the details about who owns the most shares of Facebook and what influence they might have on the future of the business.

What is Meta Platforms (META)?

Meta Platforms is the name of the company that was formerly known as Facebook. Founded in 2004 by a group of Harvard students including its current CEO Mark Zuckerberg after they created a social app called The Facebook.

Since then Facebook has grown to become the world’s largest social media platform with approximately 2.9 billion monthly active users. In addition the parent company acquired two widely successful mobile apps Instagram and WhatsApp whose results are now being reported under the segment Family of Apps.

As per the latest quarterly report Meta Platforms’ Family of Apps had a combined monthly active people (MAP) of 3.65 billion – almost half of the world’s population.

On 28 October last year Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms. The new name is considered to be a better reflection of the business’s aim to become a leading player in the up-and-coming metaverse industry. The ticker symbol assigned to the company’s Class A common shares was changed from FB to META.

In 2022 Meta Platforms generated a revenue of over 116 billion U.S. dollars a slight decrease on the previous year. The majority of Meta’s profits come from its advertising revenue which amounted to 113.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. Meta Platforms employs over 80000 people.

The groups share price rose in February when it beat analysts estimates for its Q4 earnings release with earning per share coming in at $1.76 and revenue at $32.17bn vs $31.53bn expected according to Refinitiv.

Facebook biggest shareholders: What is Mark Zuckerberg’s stake?

Who are the stakeholders of Facebook? According to Meta Platform’s latest annual report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Mark Zukerberg owns over 800000 Class A Shares and over 300000000 Class B Shares. The next biggest share holders are the groups CFO Susan Li and Chief Product Officer Christopher K. Cox.

3258 stockholders of record held the company’s Class A common stock by the end of December 2022.

Other 5% shareholders inculde BlackRock FMR LLC and Vanguard.

As of 31 March 2023 Meta had 2215650705 shares of Class A common stock and 350578831 shares of Class B common stock outstanding.

Holders of Class B META shares are entitled to have 10 votes for every share they own while Class A stockholders only have one vote per share. These votes can be cast during any stockholders’ meeting to decide on the company’s affairs.

The annual report also disclosed that there were 2.3 billion Class A common stock of Meta Platforms in circulation by 28 January 2022 along with 412.86 million Class B common stock.

This information is important for Meta Platforms shareholders and prospective investors. All decisions concerning the company’s vision future and strategy will have to be approved by Zuckerberg as he holds the majority of the company’s voting power.

According to data compiled by Refinitiv as of June 2022 other top executive holders of the company’s stock include Michael Todd Schroepfer David Wehner David Fischer Jennifer Newstead and Peter Thiel.

Institutional Facebook shareholders

The list of Facebook major shareholders as of August 2022 includes some prominent fund management companies. Data from Refinitiv put the list of top Meta Platforms shareholders as: The Vanguard Group Fidelity Management BlackRock Institutional State Street Global and T. Rowe Price Associates.

The Vanguard Group: 7.9% stake

The Vanguard Group is one of the world’s largest asset management firms. The US-based company had total assets under management (AUM) of approximately $7.3trn in 2021. According to Statista Vanguard's AUM increased more than sevenfold in the decade and a half since 2005.

Many individual and corporate investors may own META stock through one of the investment vehicles that Vanguard offers such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). As of 30 June 2022 Vanguard had more than 30 million investors.

According to Refinitiv’s data as of 13 August The Vanguard Group held 180 million of META shares accounting for 7.9% of the company’s stock.

Fidelity Management: 4.9% stake

Fidelity Investments is one of America’s oldest financial services firms. In 1943 Edward C. Johnson II took over the Fidelity Fund founded in 1930. In 1946 he founded Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR Co.) to act as investment advisor to the Fund.

In 2022 Fidelity managed $4.2trn in assets for its customers. It’s led by CEO Abigail Johnson the founder’s granddaughter who took over from her father in 2014 and has been chairman since 2016.

According to Refinitiv’s data as of 13 August Fidelity Management held 112 million shares in Meta Platforms accounting for 4.9% of the company’s stock.

BlackRock: 4.4% stake

Blackrock is another US-based asset management firm that offers access to the stock market via a wide range of passive and actively managed vehicles such as ETFs and mutual funds.

Kyrsten Sinema the Arizona Democrat who single-handedly thwarted her party’s longtime goal of raising taxes on wealthy investors received nearly $1 million over the past year from private equity professionals hedge fund managers and venture capitalists whose taxes would have increased under the plan.

For years Democrats have promised to raise taxes on such investors who pay a significantly lower rate on their earnings than ordinary workers. But just as they closed in on that goal last week Sinema forced a series of changes to her party’s $740 billion election-year spending package eliminating a proposed “carried interest” tax increase on private equity earnings while securing a $35 billion exemption that will spare much of the industry from a separate tax increase other huge corporations now have to pay.

The bill with Sinema’s alterations intact was given final approval by Congress on Friday and is expected to be signed by President Joe Biden next week.

WATCH: Democrats pass landmark climate and health bill

Sinema has long aligned herself with the interests of private equity hedge funds and venture capital helping her net at least $1.5 million in campaign contributions since she was elected to the House a decade ago. But the $983000 she has collected since last summer more than doubled what the industry donated to her during all of her preceding years in Congress combined according to an Associated Press review of campaign finances disclosures.

The donations which make Sinema one of the industry’s top beneficiaries in Congress serve a reminder of the way that high-power lobbying campaigns can have dramatic implications for the way legislation is crafted particularly in the evenly divided Senate where there are no Democratic votes to spare. They also highlight a degree of political risk for Sinema whose unapologetic defense of the industry’s favorable tax treatment is viewed by many in her party as indefensible.

“From their vantage point it’s a million dollars very well spent” said Dean Baker a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research a liberal-leaning think tank. “It’s pretty rare you see this direct of a return on your investment. So I guess I would congratulate them.”

Sinema’s office declined to make her available for an interview. Hannah Hurley a Sinema spokesperson acknowledged the senator shares some of the industry’s views on taxation but rebuffed any suggestion that the donations influenced her thinking.

“Senator Sinema makes every decision based on one criteria: what’s best for Arizona” Hurley said in a statement. “She has been clear and consistent for over a year that she will only support tax reforms and revenue options that support Arizona’s economic growth and competitiveness.”

The American Investment Council a trade group that lobbies on behalf of private equity also defended their push to defeat the tax provisions.

“Our team worked to ensure that members of Congress from both sides of the aisle understand how private equity directly employs workers and supports small businesses throughout their communities” Drew Maloney the organization’s CEO and president said in a statement.

Sinema’s defense of the tax provisions offer a jarring contrast to her background as a Green Party activist and self-styled “Prada socialist” who once likened accepting campaign cash to “bribery” and later called for “big corporations & the rich to pay their fair share” shortly before launching her first campaign for Congress in 2012.

She’s been far more magnanimous since praising private equity in 2016 from the House floor for providing “billions of dollars each year to Main Street businesses” and later interning at a private equity mogul’s boutique winery in northern California during the 2020 congressional recess.

The soaring contributions from the industry to Sinema trace back to last summer. That’s when she first made clear that she wouldn’t support a carried interest tax increase as well as other corporate and business tax hikes included in an earlier iteration of Biden’s agenda.

During a two-week period in September alone Sinema collected $47100 in contributions from 16 high-ranking officials from the private equity firm Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe records show. Employees and executives of KKR another private equity behemoth contributed $44100 to Sinema during a two-month span in late 2021.

In some cases the families of private equity managers joined in. David Belluck a partner at the firm Riverside Partners gave a $5800 max-out contribution to Sinema one day in late June. So did three of his college-age kids with the family collectively donating $23200 records show.

“I generally support centrist Democrats and her seat is important to keep a Democratic Senate majority” Belluck said adding that his family has known Sinema since her election to Congress. “She and I have never discussed private equity taxation.”

The donations from the industry coincide with a $26 million lobbying effort spearheaded by the investment firm Blackstone that culminated on the Senate floor last weekend.

By the time the bill was up for debate during a marathon series of votes Sinema had already forced Democrats to abandon their carried interest tax increase.

“Senator Sinema said she would not vote for the bill .. unless we took it out” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters last week. “We had no choice.”

But after private equity lobbyists discovered a provision in the bill that would have subjected many of them to a separate 15% corporate minimum tax they urgently pressed Sinema and other centrist Democrats for changes according to emails as well as four people with direct knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

“Given the breaking nature of this development we need as many offices as possible weighing in with concerns to Leader Schumer’s office” Blackstone lobbyist Ryan McConaghy wrote in a Saturday afternoon email obtained by the AP which included proposed language for modifying the bill. “Would you and your boss be willing to raise the alarm on this and express concerns with Schumer and team?”

McConaghy did not respond to a request for comment.

Sinema worked with Republicans on an amendment that stripped the corporate tax increase provisions from the bill which a handful of vulnerable Democrats also voted for.

“Since she has been in Congress Kyrsten has consistently supported pro-growth policies that encourage job creation across Arizona. Her tax policy positions and focus on growing Arizona’s economy and competitiveness are longstanding and well known” Hurley the Sinema spokesperson said.

But many in her party disagree. They say the favorable treatment does little to boost the overall economy and argue there’s little compelling evidence to suggest the tax benefits are enjoyed beyond some of the wealthiest investors.

Some of Sinema’s donors make their case.

Blackstone a significant source of campaign contributions owns large tracts of real estate in Sinema’s home state Arizona. The firm was condemned by United Nations experts in 2019 who said Blackstone’s financial model was responsible for a “financialization of housing” that has driven up rents and home costs “pushing low-income and increasingly middle-income people from their homes.”

Blackstone employees executives and their family members have given Sinema $44000 since 2018 records show.

In a statement Blackstone called the allegations by the U.N. experts “false and misleading” and said all employee contributions are “strictly personal.” The firm added that it was “incredibly proud of its investments in housing.”

Another major financial services donor is Centerbridge Partners a New York-based firm that buys up the debt of distressed governments and companies and often uses hardball tactics to extract value. Since 2017 Sinema has collected at least $29000 from donors associated with the firm including co-founder Mark Gallogly and his wife Elizabeth Strickler records show.

In 2012 Centerbridge Partners purchased Arizona-based restaurant chain P.F. Chang’s for roughly $1 billion. After loading the struggling company up with $675 million of debt they sold it to another private equity group in 2019 according to Bloomberg News. The company received a $10 million coronavirus aid loan to cover payroll but shed jobs and closed locations as it struggled with the pandemic.

Centerbridge Partners was also part of a consortium of hedge funds that helped usher in an era of austerity in Puerto Rico after buying up billions of dollars of the island government’s $72 billion debt — and filing legal proceedings to collect. A subsidiary of Centerbridge Partners was among a group of creditors who repeatedly sued one of the U.S. territory’s pension funds. In one 2016 lawsuit the group of creditors asked a judge to divert money from a Puerto Rican pension fund in order to collect.

A Centerbridge representative could not immediately provide comment Friday.

Liberal activists in Arizona say they plan to make Sinema’s reliance on donations from wealthy investors a campaign issue when she is up for reelection in 2024.

“There are many takes on how to win but there is no universe in which it is politically smart to fight for favorable tax treatment of the wealthiest people in the country” said Emily Kirkland a political consultant who works for progressive candidates. “It’s absolutely going to be a potent issue.”

Designed by COOKFOX Architects and developed by L&L Holding Company and Columbia Property Trust the $1.25 billion project will overhaul the 121-year-old warehouse structure and yield a mix of Class A office suites retail space and dining options. L&L and Normandy Real Estate Partners purchased the Terminal Warehouse in 2018 for $880 million and CBRE helped to arrange construction funding from the Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies platform Goldman Sachs KKR and Oaktree Capital Management. New Line Structures & Development is the general contractor for the property which is bound by West 28th Street to the north West 27th Street to the south Eleventh Avenue to the east and West Street to the west.

Almost all of the Terminal Warehouse is shrouded in black netting and scaffolding and a construction crane has been assembled on the northern side along West 28th Street. A small portion of the old brick façade remains exposed offering a final glimpse of the original exterior before its restoration.

The Porchlight restaurant at the corner of Eleventh Avenue and West 28th Street is still in operation.

The renderings below depict the final appearance of the renovation which will feature a stepped outdoor courtyard carved out from the center of the structure. Plans also call for the restoration of nearly 1.4 million square feet of wooden floors along with other historical elements like the chimneys metal signage and shutters for the signature arched windows. The 670-foot-long tunnel running down the middle will also be revitalized and lined with retail and dining stalls.

The Terminal Warehouse is slated to finish work in the fall of 2023 as noted on the construction board.

Sky News has learnt that a vehicle connected to the Harris family which helped to establish Bourne Leisure in the 1960s is close to signing a transaction with Blackstone the group's current owner.

It was unclear whether Paul Harris the family member understood to be leading the deal had arranged any external financing to support it.

A deal which could be struck as soon as next week would take the total proceeds from the sale of Butlin's to more than £600m - a significant achievement in an economy being ravaged by inflation and forecasts of a prolonged recession.

The Harris family's interest bid to acquire Butlin's comes 18 months after it sold Bourne Leisure to Blackstone the giant American private equity firm for more than £3bn.

As part of that deal Blackstone said at the time that the Harris Cook and Allen founding families were reinvesting in Bourne Leisure although it is unclear how large a stake the trio now own.

An auction of the chain of three holiday camps has been under way since early this year drawing interest from financial bidders including Bain Capital Epiris TDR Capital and Guy Hands' Terra Firma Capital Partners.

Bourne Leisure itself has owned Butlin's since 2000 when it bought the business and its sister brands Haven Holidays and Warner Hotels in a deal reportedly worth £600m.

Last month the UK's biggest private pension fund the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) confirmed a Sky News report that it was buying Butlin's underlying real estate assets for £300m.

The sale of its operating business is notable because of the number of failed auctions being triggered by turmoil in global debt financing markets.

Among the deals to have been pulled were auctions of Parkdean Resorts another big leisure group and Boots Britain's biggest high street chemist.

Numerous other sale processes have been postponed as companies grapple with one of the toughest operating environments for decades.

Butlin's was established by its eponymous founder Billy Butlin in 1936 and rapidly became one of the most popular holiday destinations for staycationing Britons.

According to the brand's official history Mr Butlin ""felt sorry for families staying in drab guest-houses with nothing much to do"" during a trip to Barry Island.

In its heyday Butlin's operated from nine sites across the UK entertaining one million holidaymakers each year with knobbly knees competitions and glamorous granny contests.

The brand became such an entrenched part of Britain's popular consciousness that it provided the inspiration for Hi-de-Hi! the long-running BBC sitcom.

Its fortunes waned with the explosive growth of opportunities for Britons to holiday abroad but has enjoyed a resurgence as the pandemic has fuelled a boom in domestic vacations.

Butlin's sites are at Skegness Minehead in Somerset and Bognor Regis the traditional seaside town close to the South Downs National Park.

Rothschild the investment bank is advising Blackstone on the Butlin's sale.

The board unanimously adopted a memorandum of understanding that will establish the processes it will use to evaluate the quality of Boeing's stormwater discharges from the toxic site outside Simi Valley once the company completes the soil cleanup.

The MOU is separate from the settlement agreement between the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and Boeing but related to the long-delayed remediation.

Had the board not adopted it the settlement announced in May could not have been enacted said Jared Blumenfeld secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Blumenfeld attended the board's nine-hour hearing at Santa Clarita City Hall in Valencia.

Adoption of the MOU means that ""we can get the cleanup done and we can get it done right"" he said.

The toxic substances control department which is part of the EPA is overseeing the cleanup.

Boeing owns most of the 2850-acre site which experienced a partial nuclear meltdown in 1959 when it was the Rocketdyne/Atomics International rocket engine test and nuclear facility.

The site was a premiere research facility for the United States during the Cold War and also experienced other chemical and radioactive contamination over the years.

Under consideration: Ventura County weighs legal action in cleanup of former nuclear test site near Simi

The EPA says that under the stringent settlement Boeing is tasked with cleaning up radioactive contamination in the soil to ""background"" level the strictest cleanup standard. The pact establishes rigorous remediation protocols and timelines for Boeing the EPA says.

But Boeing is only responsible for remediating portions of the site said Dan Hirsch a leading cleanup activist.

Fierce opposition

The water board adopted the MOU despite dozens of public speakers who urged it not to on grounds that the settlement would allegedly leave at least 90% of Boeing's contaminated soil not cleaned up.

""I don't believe you can say with a straight face that this Boeing deal serves the public interest"" said Jeff Ruch Pacific director of nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.

The state refutes the contention that 90% or more of the soil would not be remediated.

""This crude estimate is factually incorrect"" Meredith Williams director of the toxic substances control department told the board online.

Her department ""will require Boeing to remove all soil necessary to achieve the target results"" she said.

Prior to voting board member Marissa Christiansen said she had agonized over whether to support or oppose the MOU.

""I was thinking to myself that I didn't want perfection to be the enemy of progress"" she said. ""That I wanted us to hopefully push forward just to get the cleanup started for the sake of this community.""

But given all the public comments against the MOU she said she also had to consider ""deferring to community interest because it's their lives and not ours.""

In the end Christiansen voted to adopt the MOU.

Undermines: Cleanup activists say new agreement with Boeing weakens field lab remediation

Board member David Nahai echoed Christiansen's remarks.

""I think it's incumbent upon us to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good but to move forward"" he said. ""I want to see movement. I want to get going. I don't want to have a situation in which we return to a position of limbo.""

Following the MOU's approval Williams said in a statement that the board's action ""clears the way for a stringent cleanup at one of the nation’s most polluted sites and is a monumental step forward after decades of stalled progress.""

Boeing too praised the memo's adoption.

Spokesman Connor Greenwood said that the MOU and the settlement agreement ""create a comprehensive framework that will provide regulatory certainty and a clear accelerated path forward for Boeing’s cleanup at the former Santa Susana Field Laboratory.""

The framework ""reflects Boeing’s deep commitment to safety sustainability and the communities where we live and work"" Greenwood said.

But Hirsch who spoke at the hearing said Friday he was devastated but not surprised that the board adopted the MOU.

""I've spent 43 years on this and Boeing got everything it wanted"" said Hirsch president of the Committee to Bridge the Gap a nonprofit nuclear policy organization.

""It was crystal clear that not an ounce of the testimony mattered"" he said.

Cleanup long delayed

A smaller portion of the site is administered by NASA. The federal Department of Energy had buildings there but has since demolished them.

The two agencies are not part of the settlement agreement with Boeing but under previous legally binding pacts with the state they are responsible for cleaning up other portions of the site.

Under the 2007 and 2010 agreements the remediation of soil and groundwater was supposed to have been completed by the end of 2017. But it hasn't begun yet.

Williams said under the new settlement Boeing's part of the cleanup will still take several years to begin.

If Boeing completes its soil cleanup to the water board's satisfaction the board will then consider lifting the company's pollutant discharge elimination system permit which regulates its surface water discharges.

If the permit is lifted that would result in Boeing's discharges no longer being regulated according to cleanup activists.

Since the settlement doesn't cover all of Boeing's soil stormwater runoff from those portions could still be toxic but not monitored the activists say.

Past runoff has been contaminated and has gone into neighboring communities and waterways they say.

In a related development Ventura County is partnering with Simi Valley Los Angeles County and the city of Los Angeles to consider litigation if the cleanup isn't done to background levels.

The Ventura County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the partnership Aug. 2 in closed session. County Counsel Tiffany North announced the action in open session.

POCASSET — Bill Lytle a retired machine operator who refuses to let health problems slow him down has his mobile home set up just the way he likes it.

“This is our slice of heaven” Lytle 69 said on a recent afternoon as he toured his mobile home park with a Globe reporter and a few neighbors.

“The vultures want it!” Jim McSharry 61 a retired trucker called out in response. “But they’re not going to get it.”

The midday sun beat down on the group but no one seemed to care. They were focused on something even more intense: their legal battle against Crown Communities LLC a Wyoming-based firm that owns and operates 17 other mobile home parks and is trying to buy their scratch of land in Pocasset.

It’s a fight playing out across the country as big money investors increasingly see there are profits to be made off the backs of the financially vulnerable. In Pocasset homeowners fear if Crown buys their park they’ll lose control over their own destinies.

Manufactured homes which averaged $123000 new last year up considerably from pre-pandemic levels are among the most affordable nonsubsidized housing left — often among the only choices for people living on the edge financially. But a generation of “mom and pop” operators are selling to investors who have discovered how easy it is to cash in on people who have little recourse.

Each fight is ugly in its own way and in Pocasset where residents have organized to try to buy the park themselves for $3.8 million they say Crown has waged a campaign to break their coalition with a mix of scare tactics and enticements some of them downright insulting.

“They are trying to buy us out with stupid things like $50 gift cards” said Al MacDonald 73 a retired general contractor who does handyman work. He recalled a winter day when Crown representatives came to the park to woo residents.

“A couple of gals banged the daylights out of doors so people would answer” he said.

In letters to homeowners viewed by the Globe Crown dangled what it calls the “Crown Guarantee” which among other things promises a rent freeze for two years and a home remodeling credit worth up to $5000 if they support Crown (and the company is successful in its quest to buy the park).

Crown also sought to make the case that siding with the residents who want to buy would be a mistake. With its resources and experience Crown intends to make improvements that would make the park a “nicer place to live” the firm said in the letters.

“Please be aware that whatever the perceived benefits of having an association of tenants running the park this ultimately puts you at risk of being told what to do by other residents in the park who may themselves not be financially responsible” one letter sent to residents read.

“We have concluded that there are approximately $1000000 of improvements that need to be done to the park” another letter read. “A question to ask is ‘who is going to do all this hard work’? The new Association which is really the current tenants?”

The tug-of-war is heading to Barnstable Superior Court on Aug. 15 where Crown is suing both the homeowners association that formed to buy the mobile home park and the current owner claiming that Crown is the rightful buyer.

Citing the pending litigation Crown declined to comment.

One of Crown’s leaders is Heath M. Biddlecome who ran afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly defrauding investors many elderly in a fund to invest in mobile home parks. The agency alleged he diverted nearly half of the almost $10 million raised and used it for day trading. Biddlecome settled with the SEC without admitting or denying wrongdoing in 2011. Another Crown official is — as his New York Times wedding announcement noted — a great-grandson of Godfrey Lowell Cabot the famed Boston industrialist.

Mobile homes represent only about 6 percent of the occupied housing stock in the United States according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau but they occupy a big space in the popular imagination. They star in movies TV shows and news stories about destructive tornadoes and hurricanes. Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter lived in a mobile home in “Raising Arizona.” The Cowboy Junkies Eminem the country star Toby Keith have all crooned about them.

“Grab a six pack and a lawn chair there’s a tornado coming” Keith sang in the upbeat 2010 song “Trailerhood.”

An estimated 40 percent of mobile homes in the United States are in mobile home parks. But despite their high profile many people don’t know perhaps the single most important thing about life in the vast majority of these communities: The residents may own their homes but — crucially — they only rent the land on which the homes sit.

And while mobile homes were once in fact mobile allowing people to haul them from park to park with relative ease they are not today — a fact that works to the advantage of investors. Even if you can do it without damaging the home — not an easy feat — moving one can cost up to $15000 according to one expert so their owners are pretty much stuck where they live.

“What we have is a captive class of our lowest-income homeowners” said sociologist Esther Sullivan author of “Manufactured Insecurity: Mobile Home Parks and Americans’ Tenuous Right to Place.”.

“Landlords can raise rents and tack on fees upon fees and fail to maintain the property with the knowledge that the homeowner can’t go anywhere” she said. “Their biggest asset is installed on land they don’t own and they can’t afford to move it.”

That fact is a big selling point for investors looking to profit off the financially vulnerable.

A website for Mobile Home University which runs boot camps for aspiring park tycoons puts it like this: “Virtually no tenants can ever afford to move. As a result the revenues of mobile home parks are unbelievably stable.”

That adds up to tremendous leverage over park residents or as the Center for Public Integrity put it in a headline on a 2015 report about one of the biggest players in the space: “Warren Buffet’s mobile home empire preys on the poor” referring to lending practices at the time by Clayton Homes which is owned by Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway.

Here’s what residents in investor-owned parks are up against according to Andrew Danforth a cooperative financial consultant with the Cooperative Development Institute a nonprofit that helps residents own and run their own parks.

As of several years ago Danforth said rents for homes in investor-owned parks were increasing 4 percent a year on average — some notably higher— compared with 0.9 percent in parks owned by their residents.

“With apartment rents going up sharply nationwide rents in [investor-owned] parks will see similar increases” he said.

Life is made even harder for many mobile-home owners in this way: Around 42 percent of manufactured home purchase loans are “chattel” loans which generally have higher interest rates and fewer consumer protections than mortgages according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Most people who live in The Park at Pocasset are “low” or “very low” income Danforth said.

Right off Barlows Landing Road and 36 acres big the park is home to about 170 people — mainly retirees blue-collar workers people with disabilities families with children Danforth said.

Well-cared for homes with cheerful “welcome” signs and shaded porches share the neighborhood with derelict properties. An old mattress has been abandoned here a front door boarded shut there. The park has 123 lots with 81 occupied homes and 22 vacant many for over a decade Danforth said.

The Park at Pocasset is less than a 10-minute drive from lovely Wings Neck where the homes have important driveways multimillion-dollar views of Buzzards Bay and the lush hydrangeas of the 1 percent.

But at the mobile home park the $520-a-month price is right for people like Robin Harris who works three jobs — cleaning houses caring for an elderly man and helping out at a market. “I really really love my place” she said.

A single woman in her 50s Harris worries that if Crown buys the park she’ll be forced out of a place she’s made her own with an ornamental orange tree and hanging plants in the yard and a cozy fireplace in her living room and into a cruel housing market.

“Out there” she said the rent she pays now “gets you something junky.”

Harris said she is being threatened with eviction by the current owner over repairs she made to her deck which she alleges is part of a pattern of harassment to convince her and other residents to abandon their fight and speed the sale of the park.

The park’s owner Philip Austin and his attorney did not respond to multiple interview requests.

Pocasset’s particularly desirable location has made the park a “bullseye” said Danforth the founder of the New England Resident-Owned Communities program at CDI.

Walking around the park with a Globe reporter on that hot recent day he gestured to a few unassuming mobile homes and said Crown could replace them with short-term rental units. “They could get $1400 per week or more.

“Why rent a lot for $520 a month when you can get that tenant out rehab the home or buy a new manufactured home and rent it out for 20 weeks a year” he said.

A few mobile home parks have closed in Massachusetts in recent years for retail or other development but it can cost a lot to close a park Danforth explained in an e-mail to the Globe. “Two year notice to residents potentially having to buy and remove every home. They are generally worth more as communities. And since the homes are inexpensive [the] numbers of homes in existing parks are growing.”

Austin had struck a deal to sell the park to Crown Communities in November 2019 for $3.8 million.

But here’s what the homeowners who want to buy their community are banking on: Massachusetts is one of a few states with a law that gives homeowners in mobile home parks the right of first refusal if their community goes up for sale and they can meet certain requirements. Key among those requirements is that 51 percent or more of the residents want to buy the park.

By law once they have been notified of an offer by an outside party the residents have 45 days to exercise their statutory right of first refusal.

That notification came in November 2019 when Austin alerted the community of the P&S with Crown Communities.

And the scramble was on: The residents began to educate themselves about such a huge undertaking; they formed an association began organizing among neighbors and worked with ROC USA a nonprofit social venture that has helped hundreds of mobile home associations secure financing to buy their parks.

On Dec. 30 2019 with enough signatures to meet the 51 percent threshold the group’s attorney Thomas W. Aylesworth says the association submitted its own offer to Austin.

“We’re just little people who are trying to have some control over our lives” said Justine Shorey 66 president of the Pocasset Park Association.

Back when he helped prepare residents for the purchase Danforth estimated their monthly housing costs would roughly be the same but instead of paying rent they would be paying off a loan. The delays in closing the deal as well as the litigation he noted could add some costs to that.

Moreover beyond a one-time $100 membership fee Danforth said any increases would only reflect actual costs as opposed to padding the profits of a landlord. And with more than 40 new homes expected to open in the park in the next few years the monthly costs could even go down or remain steady for many years.

Massachusetts has some of the strongest legal protections for residents of manufactured homes and because of this speculative investment isn’t as big a problem as it is in states with weaker protections said George George W. McCarthy chief executive of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.

A tally by Nora Gosselin a market development and acquisitions specialist with the Cooperative Development Institute found there are 51 parks that have been converted to resident ownership in the state 28 since 2010 with the support of her organization.

But Crown which is currently closing in on ownership of an additional four parks wasn’t giving up. And indeed it was successful in convincing a number of residents to switch allegiances. But how many? That figure is at the crux of the lawsuit and while it would seem to have a straightforward answer the litigation says otherwise.

Among the allegations made by one side or the other: People were misinformed when they signed their support for the residents to purchase the park or were coerced into rescinding those signatures or some signatures shouldn’t count at all because the signers aren’t owners of homes in the park or don’t have rights to a tenancy in the park.

With the trial looming and a recent legal victory by Crown over another group of mobile home residents in Easton the group walking around with a Globe reporter in mid-July was on edge.

During the tour a man they did not recognize rode by on a bike twice. He seemed friendly but McSharry who worked in protective services for the Globe more than 15 years ago wasn’t buying it.

“He’s probably a spy” he said.

But the hyperbole reached a new pitch in recent weeks as the Senate moved to adopt modest drug pricing negotiation measures in the Inflation Reduction Act.

The bill “could propel us light-years back into the dark ages of biomedical research” Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization said last month. Venture capitalists and other opponents of the bill said that it “immediately will halt private funding of drug discovery and development.”

Steve Ubl leader of the ubiquitous Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA called the bill’s Senate passage on Aug. 7 a “tragic loss for patients.” He threatened in an interview with Politico to make politicians suffer if they voted for the measure adding that “few associations have all the tools of modern political advocacy at their disposal in the way that PhRMA does.”

In the past 12 months PhRMA and closely allied groups spent at least $57 million — $19 million of it since July — on TV cable radio and social media ads opposing price negotiations according to monitoring by the advocacy group Patients for Affordable Drugs. PhRMA spent over $100 million this year to unleash a massive team of 1500 lobbyists on Capitol Hill.

The final bill is weaker than earlier versions which would have extended negotiations to more drugs and included private insurance plans. The bill would enable only Medicare to negotiate prices beginning in 2026 initially for just 10 drugs.

It would save the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services about $102 billion over a decade the Congressional Budget Office estimates. In 2021 alone the top U.S. pharmaceutical companies booked tens of billions of dollars in revenue: Johnson & Johnson ($94 billion) Pfizer ($81 billion) AbbVie ($56 billion) Merck & Co. ($49 billion) and Bristol Myers Squibb ($46 billion).

The bill authorizes hundreds of millions of dollars for CMS to create a drug negotiation program setting in motion a system of cost-benefit evaluations like those used in Europe to guide price negotiations with the industry. Americans pay on average four times what many Europeans do — and sometimes far far more — for the same drugs.

The bill does not affect the list prices companies charge for new drugs which increased from a median price of $2115 in 2008 to a staggering $180007 in 2021 according to recent research.

The bill’s champions say that PhRMA’s gloomy prophecies are overblown and that history is on their side.

“It’s complete bulls**t and a scare tactic” Andy Slavitt told KHN. As a leading federal health official in 2016 he tried to change part of a Medicare program that pays doctors a fixed 6% of the cost of a drug each time they administer it creating an incentive to use the most expensive infusion drugs. PhRMA funded most of the loud campaign that defeated his efforts Slavitt said.xf

Another scare tactic: The drug industry warns that any price negotiation will kill innovation. Such warnings “constitute the pharma response in literally every instance since 1906” the year the first drug regulation agency was created said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim who leads the Program on Regulation Therapeutics and Law at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. And yet he said regulatory changes rarely choked out investment in new drugs.

For example the drug industry bemoaned a bill to boost generic drugs sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) in 1984. Yet while 50% of prescribed drugs were generics in 2000 — up from 15% in 1980 — approvals of important new drugs also soared during the period Kesselheim noted. The threat of losing market share to generics he said may have induced manufacturers to invest in innovation.

In 1993 Thomas Copmann then a PhRMA vice president charged that President Bill Clinton’s Vaccines for Children program which funded vaccinations for any kid whose parents couldn’t afford them “would just kill innovation because the government would control the market.” Over the next 16 years childhood vaccination rates climbed — from 72% to around 93% for polio vaccine for example. Over the same period new vaccines against hepatitis A and B pneumonia chickenpox human papillomavirus and rotavirus were added to the schedule.

The drug industry’s attacks on regulation have a rich and florid history. In the early 1900s the Proprietary Association of America warned newspapers that their advertising revenue would dry up if the industry had to list its ingredients (mostly alcohol). The law passed in 1906 but newspapers — and the drug industry — survived it.

Sometimes the industry’s breast-beating is a negotiating tactic one that has led to concessions from Congress and the federal government.

In the 1990s when discussions began about requiring drug companies to pay user fees to have their drugs reviewed the industry described the fees as a “tax on innovation.” Eventually it agreed to pay the fees if the FDA set deadlines for the reviews. The resulting boost in FDA staffing levels ushered in an increase in drug approvals over the ensuing five years.

Yet “killing innovation” remains a go-to trope. Drug imports efforts to rein in “pay-for-delay” agreements between brand and generic companies investigations of price gouging by drugmakers — all according to conservatives and pharmaceutical executives “kill innovation.” Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 2009 said the same about the Affordable Care Act. A golden decade for new drugs followed with FDA approvals increasing from 21 in 2010 to 50 in 2021.

Critics of the current bill argue that history and economic research show that drug investment will lag when markets shrink which they say will be the case if price controls lead corporations to earn less money on their blockbuster drugs.

If Medicare negotiations cut into the profits of the biggest earners investors in risky biotech companies whose drugs rarely strike it rich will shift some of their portfolios from pharmaceuticals into other sectors said Craig Garthwaite director of health care at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “There’s a fair argument as to how much” he said.

He noted that after Medicare’s drug program was created in 2003 — the drug industry initially opposed it — an increase in federal spending on medicines inspired pharmaceutical companies to spend more on drugs aimed at older people. “Once you invest in clinical trials that money never comes back unless it’s in revenue for products sold” he said.

The moribund antibiotics industry demonstrates how shrinking markets — hospitals and doctors intentionally limit the use of new drugs to reduce microbial resistance — lead to lower investment Garthwaite said.

Yet some experts argue that Medicare drug pricing negotiations could hasten innovation if they steer companies away from drugs that modestly improve outcomes but can earn massive amounts of cash in the current system of unchecked prices.

In the cancer field most investment is in drugs that provide incremental benefits at a high price said Dr. Vincent Rajkumar a Mayo Clinic oncologist. He was a principal investigator on two large trials testing Ninlaro (ixazomib) a pill for multiple myeloma that is very similar to the injected drug Velcade (bortezomib). While more convenient Ninlaro is no more effective he said and it costs about eight times as much as generic bortezomib. A newer multiple myeloma drug Xpovio (selinexor) keeps patients progression-free for about four additional months; it costs $22000 a month.

Most new cancer drugs extend life for only a short time said Rajkumar who helped organize a 2015 letter signed by 118 oncologists that called for giving Medicare the power to bargain. If forced to negotiate “maybe the companies would spend their research and development funds on something more meaningful” he said.

In other high-income countries drug price negotiations are the norm. “Right now we are the odd man out” Rajkumar said. “Are we really that brainy that we are right and everyone else is wrong? Are we really looking out for our public better than everyone else?”

Large patient groups such as the American Cancer Society and American Heart Association all of which have significant drug industry support stayed on the sidelines of the debate over the language in the drug price negotiation bill.

Some other patient groups fearful that the industry will lose interest in drugs for smaller populations should prices decline opposed the bill — and successfully won exceptions that would prevent Medicare from negotiating prices on drugs for rare diseases.

David Mitchell a multiple myeloma patient who founded Patients for Affordable Drugs in 2017 said he’s sure the bill won’t discourage innovation — and his life may depend on it. The 68-year-old said he’s on a four-drug regimen but “cancer is very clever and finds a way to get around drugs.”

“The idea that taking a small bite out of pharma revenue is going to stop them from creating new drugs is bulls**t” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhjcGxpdmUuY29tL3ZpZXcvbWlsbGVyLWd1aWRhbmNlLWNhbm5hYmlzLXBzeWNoaWF0cnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John J. Miller MD: Guidance on Cannabis Use in Psychiatry,"Cannabis use in psychiatry is something that has become much more complex in recent decades.

Whether or not the drug has positive psychiatric effects can be largely based on the individual percentages of the 2 main compounds of marijuana--tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).

In an interview with HCPLive® John J. Miller MD Medical Director Brain Health Website Seacoast Mental Health Center and co-chair of the 2022 Annual Psychiatric Times™ World CME Conference in San Diego explained how complicated the guidance for promoting cannabis is for patients with conditions like depression and anxiety.

“One of the biggest issues currently is that cannabis is a very vague and general term” Miller said. “Back in the early 60s when it was being used recreationally it was from the original plant. Those strains of cannabis had about 2% THC and 2% CBD.”

Miller said the CBD molecule is the part that has shown efficacy in treating conditions like psychosis and anxiety while also having inflammatory properties.

He also said 1 of the issues with current studies is they will use the term “cannabis” without breaking down the percentages of THC and CBD.

“A lot of the literature because it doesn’t differentiate the components of the cannabis it is hard to draw evidence based conclusions that we can apply clinically” Miller said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uZ2xvYmVzLmNvLmlsL2VuL2FydGljbGUtY29tcHVnZW4tY2hhbmdlcy1kcnVnLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1zdHJhdGVneS0xMDAxNDIxNDMz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Compugen changes drug discovery business strategy - Globes,"When predictive drug discovery company Compugen Ltd. (Nasdaq: CGEN; TASE:CGEN) held its IPO on Nasdaq in August 2000 the twin towers were still standing and the initial rough draft of the human genome sequence had just been published.

Compugen was a pioneer in bioinformatics which combined genome data with computer capabilities but enthusiasm for the discipline quickly waned as first the 'genome bubble' burst almost immediately after its IPO quickly followed by the bursting of the dot.com bubble.

Compugen not only survived back then but is also one of the only bioinformatics companies to have survived since then. It currently has a market cap of $128 million down 90% from a peak of $1.5 billion in 2020.

Only a biotech company could survive 30 years since it was founded without producing any revenue. Compugen has burned through losses of $440 million since it was founded (perhaps more than any other Israeli life sciences company). And still it is looked upon as a company with potential.

Last week Compugen reported a change in focus which includes ending its collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). The company has made such unexpected changes in direction twice previously not because of failures in clinical trials but following upheavals to make its business model in computational biology more precise. Israeli company Evogene (TASE: EVGN; Nasdaq: EVGN) formerly a subsidiary of Compugen has coped with similar challenges in the field of agritech.

Compugen changed its model for the first time in 2004. Prior to that the company would provide computer services to pharmaceutical companies and even recorded some initial revenue but understood that wasn't where the big money was because it was looked on as a service company. Compugen decided that in order to demonstrate how much its systems were worth and in order to receive a larger part of the value it was creating it needed to develop its own drugs. So many of Compugen's mathematicians were replaced by biologists. The company currently has 70 employees in its Holon headquarters.

The plan wasn't to bring products to market independently but to bring finalized products to the drug companies which would take them on to clinical trials. In 2009 Compugen chairman Martin Gerstel speculated that if the company could discover dozens of drugs and put them into the development pipeline of the big pharma companies at least a few of them would advance to stages that would yield major returns. By 2010 the company had announced some scientific discoveries and even signed first agreements with drug companies but progress was painstakingly slow.

At that time Compugen made sure not to enter any independent clinical trials so the $58 million it had raised in 2000 lasted it through until 2009 together with small amounts from collaboration agreements and the sale of Evogene shares which were then at a peak.

In 2010 Dr. Anat Cohen-Dayag was promoted to CEO and in 2011 the company announced another change in its business model: a focus on immunotherapy - in other words drugs that use the immune systems of the patient to battle against cancer and specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors drugs that prevent cancer from 'lurking' in the immune system or halting the attack by the immune system on the tumor. This stood out as the biggest possible opportunity for a computational biology company and it was clear that if the company had good products in this area the pharmaceutical companies would not be able to ignore it. To get matters into perspective Merck's Keytruda a cancer drug in this sector has annual sales of $14 billion.

The market rewarded Compugen for this decision and the share price began to rise. In 2013 the company's approach was ostensibly justified when pharma giant Bayer took on two of Compugen's cancer treatment drugs and invested $10 million in the company immediately and also made subsequent payments. The company's market cap jumped to $500 million.

In 2014 the company announced the discovery of a new immune checkpoint inhibitor called COM701 in the market with the greatest potential at that time. Compugen subsequently announced the discovery of two more TIGIT type immune checkpoint inhibitors while a company called Genentech devised them through other methods. TIGIT became one of the most interesting fields in the cancer market with all the big companies trying to develop drugs that would work in this way.

The two TIGIT discoveries put Compugen on the map in scientific terms and demonstrated that its system knew what it was doing. But there was still a long way to go in commercializing its knowhow. Compugen had to show that these actions genuinely changed the cancer process and that the drug it had developed to intervene in the mechanism really could combat the cancer.

In this way Compugen reached the stage where drug development burns through a lot of money. But it was in the hottest area of the industry so it was able to raise more money. The public injected $150 million into the company's coffers in a secondary offering and $32 million came from the agreement with BMS which has just ended.

A new approach with dangers

So today Compugen has its own unique product COM701 the TIGIT product it discovered at the same time as other companies and it also strongly believes in the powerful effectiveness of combining them to treat other types of cancers.

The agreement signed with BMS is designed to check this three-way treatment of COM701 and the TIGIT further developed by BMS and another product of BMS which it contributed to the agreement with Compugen while the company was responsible for financing the trials.

The enthusiasm for TIGIT products in particular and biotech in general saw Compugen's share price soar in 2029 fueled by investment from guru Cathie Wood's Ark Invest which held a 10% stake in the company making it the biggest shareholder.

But then another bubble burst and the TIGIT sector went out of fashion after the failure of a trial by pharma giant Roche.

So after burning through $440 million since it was founded mainly on clinical trials and quality employees the company has $100 million in its coffers. Compugen has now ended its agreement with BMS to save money during a period that it expects to be financially challenging but also for strategic reasons. Due to the fall in interest in its drugs including in the TIGIT field while believing that its product is in a good category and is better than other companies it wants to promote its products itself in categories that it believes can still prove themselves as having the most major value.

This is an approach that has risks and takes the company one stage back in its clinical trials program. But if it succeeds the rights to the product will be in Compugen's hands and it will be able to move forward with it in the way that it sees fit without depending on the pace of a large pharma company and its priorities.

In addition Compugen has other products in pre-clinical stages and the product from the Bayer collaboration in Phase I trials. ""The pace at which Bayer is advancing with Compugen's product is slow compared with what is happening in the field of cancer but no slow compared with the period in which it was begun"" says a source familiar with the field.

Taking into account developments in big data and computational biology in recent years does Compugen's system still have a competitive advantage? According to a source in the sector ""Compugen will struggle to invest what is required for its system together with the significant investment in clinical trials in a period of cuts."" Another source said 'It has experienced computational biology people and anyone in the market would be happy to take them if there were cuts.""

On the other hand in the biotech sector as Compugen has proven in the past even without a commercial product and revenue it is enough that 'there are signs of oil' in the right area. The past and present are not interesting only the future.

Her coworker has confessed to the killing,"Starr Brown a Black transgender woman was shot and killed in Tennessee last month and a coworker has reportedly confessed to the crime.

Police in Memphis say Brown was murdered in the early morning hours of April 19 after she finished her work shift at Checkers a drive-thru fast-food establishment according to local CBS affiliate WREG. She was seen on video driving away in her Pontiac G3 with coworker Alexander Williamson 20 just after 2:30 a.m. Brown’s body was discovered in her car several hours later in a wooded area on Rolling Woods Drive. She suffered a single gunshot wound to her left side.

On April 28 Williamson voluntarily walked into a police station and confessed to the crime local Fox affiliate WHBQ-TV reported. He reportedly gave a full confession but police provided no information about a possible motive or why he decided to confess.

Alexander Williamson Shelby County Sheriff's Office

Brown is the 11th known trans individual to die violently this year and the second known Black trans woman to be killed according to the Human Rights Campaign.

Jasmine Tasaki founder of WeCare Tennesse which supports trans women of color in the state decried violence against Black trans women and called for greater efforts on behalf of the trans community.

“It saddens me that we are living in a time where black transwomen are murdered with no outrage” Tasaki said in a statement. “Our community continues to suffer yet we find ways to go on. It is with deep hurt that I say Starr Brown’s name. She is now with the ancestors and can rest. It’s our duty to push harder for liberation for our people; we can only save ourselves.”

Brown was a victim of violence last year when shot while waiting for an Uber after work on October 18. She was accosted by two men around 3 a.m. She was able to use mace on the man with a gun but he wiped his face and shot her in the leg. She later told local ABC affiliate WATN-TV she felt lucky that the man didn’t shoot her in the back as she fled.

This is not the first time Williamson has been charged with murder. He was arrested in 2022 along with his brothers Artavious 23 and Ajaylin. 22 for the shooting death of a man who had been in an earlier dispute with Artvavious. He reportedly returned with his brothers to the man’s Memphis home where he shot and killed him after challenging him to a fist fight WHBQ-TV reported at the time. Williamson then 19 was charged with second-degree murder."

The Jack Daniel Distillery was founded in 1866 by Jasper ""Jack"" Newton Daniel and his first Master Distiller Nathan ""Nearest"" Green in Lynchburg Tennessee. Ever since then the distillery has been successfully operating in the same location. In fact today Jack Daniel's is one of the top-selling whiskeys in the world (via The Spirits Business).

As of 2021 the distillery spans about 3000 acres (via Jack Daniel's Bottles). Much of this land is taken up by close to 100 barrel houses where tens of thousands of barrels of whiskey are stored. Countless other buildings including the stillhouse where the whiskey is made are scattered across the property.

To keep this operation running smoothly the Jack Daniel Distillery requires a lot of labor. The jobs range from behind the scenes to front and center in the tasting room.

In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Live Simon predicted that the opportunity would be upward of $100 billion.

""If you look at cannabis today in the U.S. 93% of Americans want medical cannabis legalized and about 63% 65% want adult use"" he said. ""Today it’s legal in about 33 states plus D.C. So it’s out there that … that majority of people want cannabis [to be available] legally.""

OKLAHOMA MARIJUANA INDUSTRY HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS TO BECOME ‘WILD WEST OF WEED’

Simon stressed that the opportunities could be extended to cannabis-adjacent products like food personal care items and drinks.

""What will happen once the U.S. legalizes the big companies like Diageo Brown-Forman ABI even I think the Nestles and the Unilevers will want to be into the cannabis business because they know Gen-Z millennials that's very much what they want"" Simon said.

Simon’s comments come after Senate leaders led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. last month introduced a bill that would end the federal prohibition of marijuana allowing states to set their own laws without fear of reprisal from the federal government.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jYW5uYWJpcy0xMDAtYmlsbGlvbi1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS10aWxyYXktY2VvLTEyNDkxNDUxOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cannabis: 'The U.S. is a $100 billion opportunity' Tilray CEO says,"The U.S. market for cannabis is staggering according to Tilray (TLRY) CEO Irwin Simon — even as it awaits a green light from Congress.

""The U.S. is a $100 billion opportunity in cannabis"" Simon told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""If you look at cannabis today in the U.S. 93% of Americans want medical cannabis legalized and about 63% 65% want adult use. Today it's legal in about 33 states plus D.C. So it's out there that... a majority of people want cannabis legally.""

As one of the largest growers of marijuana in the world Tilray is looking to expand its market share by focusing on recreational- and medical-use cannabis.

But the opportunities aren't constrained to the drug Simon stressed. There's also a burgeoning market for cannabis-adjacent products in categories such as food personal care products and drinks.

""What will happen once the U.S. legalizes the big companies like Diageo Brown-Forman ABI even I think the Nestle's and the Unilever's will want to be into the cannabis business because they know Gen-Z millennials that's very much what they want"" Simon said.

Curaleaf (CURLF) CEO Matt Darin echoed Simon's sentiments saying: ""We believe the future is in innovation. And many of these new categories that are coming online are really driving a lot of the growth in the industry.""

Darin highlighted the beverages category in particular as a major driver. It's ""still a small component of the market"" he said ""but we see that as one category that's going to continue to increase over time as new innovation occurs and as they become more widely distributed throughout the country.""

Recent earnings suggest growth in the cannabis space — even as the legal status of weed continues to weigh down the industry.

Tilray reported an 8% sales growth in the fiscal fourth quarter sending the stock higher though the Canadian company remained unprofitable.

Meanwhile Curaleaf saw $338 million in revenue in the second quarter and record profitability.

""We're seeing some great momentum coming out of that earlier in the year where it was a little bit more challenging"" Curaleaf's Darin said. ""So we're really pleased with the results and the trends for the industry.""

'There's never been more bipartisan support'

Still the legalization question remains a hot-button issue for the industry. Simon said that federal reforms ranging from legalization to decriminalization are a matter of when not if.

""We're very encouraged by what's coming out of Washington D.C. currently"" Darin agreed. ""There's never been more bipartisan support for sensible reforms.""

Story continues

Currently 37 states and D.C. allow for some form of medical marijuana use while 19 states and D.C. allow for recreational adult use according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

In late July Democrats introduced a bill that would decriminalize the substance on the federal level though there are not yet enough votes for it to pass POLITICO reported.

Simon noted that legalization would ""absolutely"" make sense and pointed to Canada as an example of a country that has seen benefits from legislative action.

""If you step back and look at Canada for instance it's really the only country where adult-use cannabis is legal"" Simon explained. ""And over the last 3.5-plus years it's contributed about $20 billion in taxes over 150000 jobs about $6 billion in infrastructure that has been built out.""

""Look at the tax dollars that we're losing here on cannabis not being legalized and the tax dollars that can be in"" he added. ""All the medical benefits from cannabis today whether it's pain anxiety sleep in relation to cancer in regards to different drugs that it could substitute on. So there's a tremendous amount of benefits for cannabis [and] why it should be legalized.""

That said cannabis companies are moving ahead with or without Congress through other product lines and global expansion.

""Even if cannabis does not legalize for the next few years in the U.S. we're going to get tremendous growth out of our spirits business our beer business our Manitoba Harvest business"" Simon said. ""Europe medical cannabis is legal in 20 different countries. And then with Canada. Listen Canada is the same size as California. And we're not going to stop on the acquisition trail. We're going to look at additional acquisitions to fold in within Tilray brands.""

While the effort for legalization effort moves at a slow pace Darin noted that the existing companies are trying to get a leg up on the competition.

""It is important to be early movers"" Darin said. ""That's been Curaleaf's strategy since the beginning.""

Emergency services and firefighters removing debris from a flood channel near Las Vegas Boulevard discovered a man’s lifeless body laying in floodwater Thursday night Clark County Fire Department said.

Another body was found on Friday in a flood-control channel near the south end of the Strip.

It is unclear if the deaths were a direct result of the flash floods at this time.

Thursday night’s intense downpour consumed the iconic Strip’s casinos and restaurants with video footage showing the city’s most famous locations such as Caesars and Planet Hollywood unable to contain water pouring through the ceiling.

The Department Of Public Safety Las Vegas said emergency services had several responses as a result of the “heavy monsoon rainfall.”

The National Weather Service called this the most “restless” summer monsoon season in the city has faced in a decade. AP

“There were 3 total responses for stalled vehicles in flood waters” they said in a statement to The Post. “All occupants were evacuated to safety with no medical needs or patient transport required.”

“There were two other minor weather-related responses one for a downed tree and another for some ceiling damage at an apartment complex” the statement added.

Diners in Caesars’ indoor restaurant were showered with floodwater in video footage shared with The Post.

Caesars Entertainment declined to comment.

The National Weather Service called this the most “restless” summer monsoon season in the city has faced in a decade.

The city’s entire Strip suffered major water damage on Thursday night as videos shared on social media showed casinos turning into rain gutters.

The massive flooding has also caused the city to suffer major power outages as over 17000 NV Energy customers were left without power 8NewsNow reports.

The weather service says the last time summer was this wet was in 2012. It said the storms could occur through next week.

Las Vegas was hit with more brutal flooding and lightning on Thursday and Friday. AP

Las Vegas usually receives about 4.2 inches of rain per year. The monsoon season this year has delivered 1.28 inches of rainfall so far according to a tweet from Las Vegas City Hall.

“The sheer amount of water made one of my friends very nervous – she was very concerned about the possibility of more water coming in or a partial ceiling collapse” tourist Richard Henderson who witnessed the floods in Caesars Palace told The Post.

No major renovations have occured in that time frame and the concourses — where travelers gather at their flight gates — haven’t been updated since they were built more than 40 years ago. But the increasingly busy airport is about to embark on a major facelift cobbling together funding from a variety of sources.

More than 350000 passengers passed through the Reno airport in just May 2022 alone an 11 percent increase from the same time five years ago and a 16 percent increase from 10 years ago. The airport serves about 4.1 million passengers annually and is predicted to welcome 7.3 million a year by 2046 airport spokeswoman Stacey Sunday said in an email.

“We need to have the services and facilities in place to match this growth” Sunday said. “Doing nothing isn’t an option and we are excited to give people more of what they love about RNO.”

The Reno-Tahoe International Airport or RNO will undergo renovations to accommodate the increasing number of travelers coming through Northern Nevada. The renovations will include a new ticketing hall new loop road for dropping off and picking up passengers parking garage updates and possibly two new concourses.

The airport is relying on funding from various sources for the project including Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority’s cash revenue-backed bonds as well as income from airline rates and charges. It will also be using funds from fees paid by passengers and rental car companies.

So far RNO has secured funding for all the upcoming renovations except for the new concourses. State grants and federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law may be put toward the project as well.

Airport officials haven’t applied for state or federal funding though the money received from those sources will determine whether the existing concourses will be expanded or if two new concourses will be built Sunday said.

The renovations are happening in phases. The first update set to begin by mid-September is a $20 million to $30 million expansion to the ticketing hall. Besides making the ticketing hall bigger the renovations will feature touchless travel technology and new restrooms.

In 2024 a $175 million to $225 million four-story parking garage will be built to accommodate more rental cars and space for Reno residents leaving their cars at the airport while they travel.

The updates will be finished in 2028 ending with the construction of two updated concourses. The concourses which will include a larger gate sitting area more retail stores food options and an expanded Customs and Border Protection or CBP facility is likely to cost more than $300 million.

“We will work hard to maintain that as much as possible throughout construction but we know there will be impacts due to the construction” Sunday said.

Sunday recommends passengers check RNO’s website and social media accounts for updates as construction unfolds and advises passengers to arrive at least two hours before their scheduled flight.

Travelers may need extra time navigating certain areas including the loop road which features six lanes in front of the airport but will be reduced to three during construction. And when renovations begin inside the ticketing hall this fall there will only be two entrances and exits — one on the south end and one on the north end.

The economic effect

Despite the hassles travelers may experience during the renovations city officials said

RNO’s expansion will positively affect the entire Northern Nevada region as each flight generates local revenue because passengers spend money on hotels food and entertainment.

Though the airport has not generated an impact report since 2018 UNR estimated that RNO has a $1.3 billion impact on the Reno economy annually Sunday said.

In a phone interview Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve said Reno has grown from a little city to a mid-sized city — and the services to accommodate that need to adjust.

“Reno is really growing up so those services have to grow up” she said.

Schieve said the airport plays a role in diversifying Reno’s economy. Similar to other basic services transportation attracts tourists and businesses alike. The more a city can accommodate basic needs of people the more likely businesses are to invest in an area she said.

A more user-friendly airport also can help safety and security services for Northern Nevada residents because it can be used by medical and fire departments.

While it may seem like Reno is growing up it’s actually catching up said Mike Kazmierski the president and CEO of Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada. The airport renovations — similar to the roads housing and city development in Northern Nevada — are far overdue Kazmierski said.

“Most people don't realize we're actually growing [in terms of population] slower now than we were in any period over the last 50 years” he said.

Rather than a population boom what is changing is the development of Reno’s infrastructure.

After the 2008 recession hit Reno the city did not have the resources to develop the infrastructure needed as the population continued to steadily grow over the last 15 years.

Now that the city has resources it is working on those developments all at once.

“Right now we're starting to see the infrastructure get caught back up and the expansion of the airport is part of that” Kazmierski said. “Getting our infrastructure back up to where it needs to be in meeting the needs not just of the community now but … as we go forward.”

Companies are looking to the airport facelift as a boon to their businesses as well.

Caesars Entertainment — which operates the Eldorado Resort Casino the Silver Legacy Resort Casino and Circus Circus Reno — already invests in air travel said Ken Ostempowski the Northern Nevada general manager for the gaming company. People who are consistent Caesars Entertainment guests are offered charter flights to various destinations where other Caesars Entertainment casinos and hotels exist he said.

Ostempowski said the potential for additional charter flights could bring more guests to Northern Nevada bringing more revenue to the region with them.

“Tourism continues to be a positive story here” Ostempowski said. “People are starting to recognize the little known secret of Northern Nevada.”

Southern Nevada

Southern Nevada has also seen an increase in air travel as tourism bounces back. In May Las Vegas’ Harry Reid International Airport saw 4.64 million passengers just 36000 short of their record amount reached in October 2019.

In June the October 2019 record was broken when 4.7 million passengers passed through the airport.

Chris Jones the chief marketing director for the airport said air travel has resurged in a big way despite increasing ticket costs tied to gas prices and inflation that has cut into people’s discretionary income. He expects the number of seats purchased to continue growing through the rest of summer.

“I’ve been looking ahead at this for quite some time — June had more seats than May July has more seats than June … so I suspect with absolute credibility in the numbers and things that we're seeing so far that July will be a new record month” Jones said.

Jones said the increase in passengers has prompted discussion among airport staff about capacity needs but unlike the Reno-Tahoe International Airport Harry Reid International Airport is closely surrounded by big structures such as Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and UNLV leaving little room for expansion.

That’s why conversation tends to focus on the prospect of building a second major airport to service Southern Nevada. The second airport would be built near Jean a few miles from south Las Vegas and help with the excess airplane passengers Jones said.

Over 20 years ago Congress passed the Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Transfer Act to allocate about 6400 acres of public land to the development of an airport. In 2018 Clark County commissioners voted to give an additional 17000 acres for the development of an airport.

The next step would be for the Bureau of Land Management and the Federal Aviation Administration to complete an environmental impact report but that has not started yet Jones said.

Even after the environmental impact report is complete it will be many years before the second airport could be built he said. While the existing airport has limited land space the second airport runs into the problem of air space.

“You look out and you see sky but a lot of the air to the north is controlled by the Department of Defense because of Nellis [Air Force Base]” Jones said.“You’ve got mountains to the west. You’ve just got a lot of different factors that you’ve got to play around.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLW1vbnNvb24tZmxvb2RpbmctZGVhdGhzLWNhc2luby1kYW1hZ2Uv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLW1vbnNvb24tZmxvb2RpbmctZGVhdGhzLWNhc2luby1kYW1hZ2Uv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"2 dead casino damaged by flooding in Las Vegas: ""Wettest monsoon season in ten years""","Las Vegas slammed with another major flash flood as vehicles thread through water

The most ""restless"" summer monsoon season in a decade became deadly this week as intense lightning and thunderstorms flooded parts of southern Nevada and a leaky ceiling forced table games to stop at one Las Vegas Strip casino.

A man's body was found Friday by public works crews and firefighters removing debris from a flood channel near the Las Vegas Boulevard resort area where a person died about midnight despite being pulled by firefighters from floodwaters Deputy Clark County Fire Chief Billy Samuels said. The Clark County coroner did not immediately report the identities or causes of death in either case.

Water also flowed through a parking structure flood channel near The Linq hotel and High Roller observation wheel and social media posts showed water leaking from the ceiling onto gambling tables at the Planet Hollywood resort.

You’re not going to believe this but I’m not sure if it’s raining more inside @PHVegas or outside. @VitalVegas @LasVegasLocally pic.twitter.com/7LOI1kkcb1 — Sean Sable (@SeanSable) August 12 2022

""I'm not sure if it's raining more inside @PHVegas or outside"" wrote one person on Twitter along with video from the resort.

No other injuries were reported. Officials with Caesars Entertainment Inc. owner of both properties did not immediately respond to messages about damage.

The overnight storm was similar to another that swept through Las Vegas two weeks earlier late July 28.

Friday dawned to clear skies but the National Weather Service reported thunderstorms by afternoon north and east of the Las Vegas Valley. It said heavy downpours frequent lightning and gusty winds would be possible with any storms.

A flash flood watch was in effect through the day for southern Nevada and neighboring counties: Mohave in northwest Arizona and San Bernardino in California.

Meteorologist Brian Planz said about 1.25 inches of rain fell overnight in some areas west of the Las Vegas Strip and near the city of Kingman in northwest Arizona.

One gauge in Arizona's Hualapai Mountains logged almost 2.5 inches of rain on Thursday Planz said and some Mohave County desert roads prone to flash flooding became impassible because of running water.

Social media video showed water above hubcaps of cars in some Las Vegas intersections and washing into the doorway stairs of a bus plowing through flooding.

Winds were not a widespread factor late Thursday but the weather service recorded a gust of 64 mph at North Las Vegas Airport. No damage was reported.

Planz said 0.58 inch of rain was recorded at the official measuring spot at Harry Reid International Airport bringing the total to 1.28 inches during the June 15 to Sept. 30 monsoon season.

""That makes this the wettest monsoon season in ten years"" the weather service said over a Tweet chart labeled ""Restless 2022 Monsoon."" It tallied 3.63 inches of summer rain in the region in 2012 but only a trace in 2020.

⛈️ With 0.58 inches added to the tally yesterday the monsoon season in #Vegas has delivered 1.28"" of rainfall so far! That makes this the wettest monsoon in ten years! And we've still got a month and a half left to add to our total! #VegasWeather ⛈️ pic.twitter.com/qIDn5RZWiQ — NWS Las Vegas (@NWSVegas) August 12 2022

The Las Vegas area usually receives about 4.2 inches of rain per year.

Planz said forecasts call for more storms through next week fueled by warm air and moisture drawn north from the Gulf of California.

""There's really no sign of the monsoon letting up anytime soon so we're going to continue to see the chance of scattered showers and thunderstorms each afternoon and evening"" Planz said."

Just as Norwegian's management team opted at the time to retrench back to the airline's core European markets and get rid of its entire Dreamliner fleet others spotted an opportunity.

The new Oslo-based long-haul carrier Norse Atlantic Airways which started flying in June of this year has been rolling out services to several US destinations during the summer. Norse Atlantic is led by Bjorn Tore Larsen and counts among its board members and minority shareholders the former CEO of Norwegian Bjorn Kjos (who stepped down from his executive role at Norwegian back in 2019).

Although not affiliated with Norwegian the new carrier presents many similarities with the latter's now-discontinued long-haul operation. It's not just the practically identical business model but the fact it even took in some of the Boeing 787s that had previously flown for Norwegian just that this time they are painted blue instead of red!

Will Norse atlantic succeed this time where so many others have failed before?

One of the major challenges entrants to the long-haul market face is how to use larger planes without having the same feeder network many legacy airlines rely on. The mostly point-to-point business model the majority of low-cost carriers have is often a limiting factor. Unless fares are significantly lower than other available options most passengers are unwilling to face the risks and inconveniences of using different low-cost flights for connections.

But this is where Norse Atlantic differs. The Oslo-based carrier recently announced an agreement with three different low-cost carriers — one in the U.S. and two in Europe — designed to help feed each other's networks. With this arrangement travelers will now be able to book transatlantic journeys that combine a Norse long-haul flight with short-haul flights either in the U.S. or Europe on Spirit Airlines Easyjet or Norwegian Air all in one go via a dedicated website.

At each of Norse's transatlantic gateways including places like London and New York City passengers will find an array of options for connecting to their final destination. While passengers will still need to pass through customs collect luggage and check in again before their next flight Norse aims to minimize any concerns over missing flights by only offering connections with at least two-and-a-half hours of time between flights.

Is this service helpful?

Despite the potential issues that can come up for passengers with connections Norse Atlantic's new service comes with a key advantage.

Because travelers can book their whole itinerary through the carrier (or alternatively through the Worldwide by Easyjet website where it is also available) they will not be left out in the cold if they miss their connection. Passengers who miss a connection will be rebooked on the next available flight and offered accommodations if their new flight requires an overnight stay.

This customer service component of the experience is provided by Dohop an Icelandic firm that has also developed a software platform that links the booking systems of all the airlines involved in this partnership.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Screenshot courtesy of Fly Norse) 0 1 2 3

Dohop is also taking care of any issues that arise with customers on behalf of the airlines by communicating with them through various channels including email phone and messenger apps.

What about loyalty programs?

Although Norse Atlantic doesn't have its own loyalty program or any plans to create one soon the carrier's new partnership has created an opportunity for passengers to earn Free Spirit points or Norwegian Reward CashPoints if part of the itinerary is on either airline.

Know though that you won't be able to enter your loyalty program details when you book on Norse's connections site. You'll need to wait until the booking is confirmed and then go to the website of the airline that you want to earn points with to add membership details to your itinerary.

What can travelers expect in the future?

One key question that remains to be answered is what will happen to this arrangement now that JetBlue has announced plans to acquire Spirit. After all Norse's partnership with Spirit almost coincided with JetBlue's acquisition announcement making it natural to wonder what the news will mean for the newly formed arrangement.

However it's simply too early to tell.

Sources at Spirit declined to comment about this particular matter beyond stating that Spirit and JetBlue ""continue to be vigorous competitors and will operate as completely separate companies until the regulatory review process concludes.""

It's a different story on the other side of the Atlantic where Norwegian is recovering from its recent downsizing and catching steam again.

""This agreement is a win-win for both our customers and Norwegian"" said Esben Tuman senior vice president of external communications and public affairs at Norwegian. ""Our customers throughout Europe can now connect to Norse routes across the USA. Likewise inbound customers flying Norse from the USA can now seamlessly connect to the Norwegian network throughout Europe on one ticket.""

Assuming that Norwegian stays in the short-haul market and Norse does the same in the long-haul sector the result could be a situation that closely resembles what the previous iteration of Norwegian used to be just with two separate airlines instead of one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS90b3AtcmVzb3J0cy1ib3JhLWJvcmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which should you choose? 5 top Bora Bora resorts and how to book,"When I joined the TPG team back in 2019 one destination at the top of my bucket list was French Polynesia. Unfortunately COVID-19 had other plans.

I scheduled and then had to cancel trips to Tahiti several times throughout the pandemic. Once the country finally reopened to international travel I was able to nail down dates and change my airline tickets.

During my nearly two-week visit I spent time in Bora Bora Moorea Rangiroa and Tahiti. While all four islands were memorable I found one to be particularly captivating: Bora Bora.

Despite having lofty expectations for this dreamy destination the atoll — including its accommodations — managed to sail past the high bar I had set in my mind. Here's a look at five of the top resorts on Bora Bora for every type of traveler.

For many visitors one of the main draws of Bora Bora is the opportunity to stay in a dreamy overwater bungalow or a cliffside villa with sweeping ocean panoramas. I found no shortage of luxurious accommodations throughout my stay as I hopped from resort to resort. Here were some of my favorites along with what they offer different types of travelers.

Conrad Bora Bora Nui

Best for: Hilton Honors loyalists and solo travelers seeking privacy

I spent two nights at the Conrad Bora Bora Nui a stunning property with a mix of overwater bungalows and cliffside rooms facing the Pacific Ocean. Rates here start at $1060 or 120000 Hilton Honors points per night.

The hilltop villa I was assigned comprised a balcony with a small pool that was perfect for quick dips to cool off on a hot day not to mention panoramic views of the azure and turquoise ocean currents drifting away in the distance. The interior included a huge living area palatial bathroom and a canopied bed that epitomized tropical elegance. My calls to the ""Conrad Service"" button on the room phone were always answered promptly and had there not been so much to do around the resort and the lagoon I might have just spent my entire stay in my villa.

As luck would have it two old friends of mine happened to be staying at the Conrad too so they showed me around their overwater bungalow. Their room had a balcony with a sun deck and a plunge pool that was larger than the one in my villa and they could climb right down into the lagoon.

My friends and I tried several of the property's restaurants and bars including Banyan a contemporary restaurant serving satisfying (albeit unexciting) Chinese fare but it was Tamure Beach Grill I enjoyed most.

Guests dine right on the beach enjoying a Polynesian dance show and buffet-style dishes like tangy poison cru (fish marinated in lemon juice coconut milk and various vegetables) and roasted pig cooked in a traditional underground oven and presented during a dramatic ceremony at sunset.

Since I only spent a few days at the property I didn't get a chance to try the majority of the on-site amenities such as the Hina Spa or the 24-hour fitness center but I did make the most of my Diamond status in the Hilton Honors program. In addition to receiving late checkout on request free bottled water 1000 complimentary Hilton Honors points access to premium Wi-Fi and free continental breakfast every day of my stay I had exclusive access to a special ""Hilton Honors beach"" where I spent a decent amount of my downtime.

Few things instantly put your mind at ease like the sound of water gently lapping the shore with warm sand between your toes and the sun shining down on you.

Four Seasons Resort Bora Bora

Best for: Luxury leisure travelers and couples

I spent one night in an overwater bungalow at the Four Seasons Resort Bora Bora where cash rates for standard accommodations (which are overwater bungalows) start at $1549 per night. It was my first-ever visit to a Four Seasons property and now I understand why some people love the brand so much.

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

After checking in I was whisked away to my two-room bungalow via a resort golf cart. While receiving a tour of my bungalow overlooking the placid lagoon's aquamarine waters I couldn't wait to dive right in for a swim.

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

The bungalow itself was breathtaking too with a large bedroom plus a separate seating and dining area. Nespresso coffee machines and the brand's signature beds dressed in Dobby Sateen cotton sheets come standard as do in-floor glass tiles through which you can view the lagoon's waters and aquatic life below.

As you may expect the service was just as exceptional as the bungalow itself. Most requests can be made via the Four Seasons app so you can ask for more towels or book reservations in the spa or restaurants right from the in-room tablet. It would be an excellent option for couples on a romantic getaway since you practically don't have to leave your room to enjoy Bora Bora's singular scenery.

However if you manage to pull yourself away from the room you'll find a variety of amenities at your disposal including a large spa and fitness center complex tennis courts a dive center an infinity pool and even a beach volleyball court.

There are several dining options too ranging from Mediterranean-inspired Arii Moana to a seafood-focused beach grill. I ended up visiting Vaimiti an Asian-influenced restaurant in its own overwater bungalow for a casual solo dinner of fried pork gyoza with a black vinegar sauce and sesame oil and kung pao chicken with leeks peppers and peanuts both of which were delicious.

The only other option I was able to try during my short stay was Tere Nui the open-air breakfast spot. The buffet-style smorgasbord of breakfast dishes was seemingly endless offering anything you could possibly crave in the morning.

InterContinental Bora Bora Resort & Thalasso Spa

Best for: Laid-back beach seekers

The final resort I stayed at during my time in Bora Bora was the InterContinental Bora Bora Resort & Thalasso Spa.

Featuring 84 overwater bungalows with beach lagoon island or Mount Otemanu views the property checked all my boxes when it came to overwater living in an idyllic piece of paradise. I truly unwound during my two-night stay in a standard overwater villa which is bookable starting at $1017 per night or at least 120000 IHG One Rewards points.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

The villa was superb offering a living room an office in the entryway and a separate bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows that let in lots of natural light and provided postcard-worthy water views. I especially enjoyed the attached outdoor space which had a swimming platform for easy access to the lagoon.

Determined to fit in another quintessential experience during my Bora Bora sojourn — a massage in an overwater bungalow — I booked a treatment in what ended up being one of the coolest spas I have ever visited.

The InterContinental's Deep Ocean Spa focuses on thalassotherapy which incorporates nutrient-rich seawater into an array of spa services.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy) 0 1

The facility comprises several soaking pools and hot tubs but the massage rooms are undoubtedly the most interesting spaces at the spa. Each treatment room features a window built into the floor so you can watch tropical fish swim in the lagoon below during your massage which made it even more relaxing.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

The hotel's dining outlets were plentiful and impressive too. I enjoyed a five-course dining extravaganza at Le Corail Restaurant the property's signature restaurant. The service was wonderful and the food was just as beautiful to look at as it was delicious to eat. Although I was dining alone the meal was so extraordinary I will never forget it. The food was served at a leisurely pace that never felt too slow.

My top dishes were the appetizer of beef filet marinated in mango rum with Taha'a vanilla coconut jelly and the coconut surprise which included a black and white chocolate shell coconut heart and lemongrass foam and passion fruit velouté. The three varieties of butter were pretty amazing too.

Mind the dress code. The restaurant says ""We kindly ask that male guests wear long trousers a collared shirt and covered shoes and female guests wear a dress or blouse with pants or a skirt.""

Dinner at Le Corail Restaurant was a tough act to follow but the Reef Restaurant's massive breakfast spread the next morning did not disappoint. The mix of local items like fresh fruit and American-style breakfast staples was enough to fuel me up before I headed out for a relaxing day outdoors.

Intercontinental Bora Bora Le Moana Resort

Best for: Budget-conscious visitors

While I didn't get a chance to stay at InterContinental's other Bora Bora resort I did have an opportunity to check it out before an all-terrain vehicle excursion I had signed up for that was using the property's lobby as the meet-up point.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 8 Image courtesy of Intercontinental Le Moana Bora Bora 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

The Intercontinental Bora Bora Le Moana has 61 rooms including some overwater bungalows and some beach bungalows. There is a small infinity swimming pool and a nice little beach to explore. The great thing is the location is not far from one of the most beautiful beaches in Bora Bora Matira Beach.

There are only two restaurants — Vini Vini Bar and Restaurant Terrace and Noa Noa Terrace Restaurant — but you can access other nearby restaurants which will sometimes pay for your transportation. Ask the front desk for options.

There is no gym or spa but you can sometimes get a free shuttle to the sister Intercontinental property for gym or spa activities. Ask at the front desk.

The facilities looked a bit worn and reviews from colleagues who've stayed here are hit or miss. Still there's no denying that the resort's relatively affordable room rates make it a great option for travelers sticking to a tight budget. I found nights from as low as $521 a bargain compared to the other four resorts on this list.

However those with a stash of IHG One Rewards points may have difficulty redeeming a free night here. I couldn't find much award availability during my research which Katie Genter (TPG's resident IHG expert) confirmed after finding very few awards available when doing her own search. In fact Katie couldn't find a single four-night award available.

The limited availability is definitely a drawback but if you're lucky you may find rooms for about 120000 IHG One Rewards points per night. Keep in mind though that IHG prices its awards dynamically meaning award nights here will likely require even more points due to the high demand and if you do find saver availability it might be worth checking to see if award nights are also available at the InterContinental Bora Bora Resort & Thalasso Spa which is much pricier in terms of cash.

Given how affordable (by Bora Bora standards) cash rates for rooms are though I'd consider staying here whenever I find myself back in French Polynesia.

The St. Regis Bora Bora Resort

Best for: Marriott Bonvoy fans and fancy families

With cash rates starting at about $2300 a night but going as high as $3400 I could not swing a stay at the uber-exclusive St. Regis Bora Bora Resort. However if I had unlimited money (or points) I'd no doubt want to reserve a room here.

TPG points and miles reporter Kyle Olsen loved the property when he visited years ago calling it the best resort he's ever stayed at. Despite it being designed with couples in mind Kyle had an amazing time when he visited with his parents. He was especially impressed with the spacious rooms which all come with attached outdoor areas and measure at least 1549 square feet meaning there was plenty of room for everyone. Some even feature private plunge pools.

Others at TPG including The Points Guy himself Brian Kelly and former editor-at-large Zach Honig also enjoyed the property listing the large renovated rooms wide selection of activities and delicious seafood as highlights. However the service could be lackluster at times according to them and everything from the rooms to meals at the five on-site restaurants is expensive.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 The St. Regis Bora Bora Resort. (Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

The massive property features a swim-up bar pool and an adults-only pool. With three beaches you'll never want for a place to swim or sunbathe.

There are six restaurants or bars to get food and drink including the quite well-known Lagoon Restaurant by Jean-Georges. The Iridium Spa is on an island in the middle of the hotel's famous lagoonarium where you can also snorkel undisturbed in schools of local fish.

There is free access to nonmotorized activities like stand-up paddle boarding and kayaking. There's also a gym a kids club and even an artist-in-residence with a small museum.

If you're hoping to trim resort costs by redeeming Marriott Bonvoy points know that you'll need a lot of them to cover a stay here. During off-peak dates in February Kyle was able to find rooms available for as few as 70000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night. Based on my own research though award nights are tough to find. On the few dates I found with availability the property was charging 187400 Marriott Bonvoy points per night.

Expand your search to options using a combination of points and cash and you'll find more availability. I came across redemptions ranging from $339 plus 120000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night to a whopping $942 plus 140000 Bonvoy points per night depending on the dates I selected. While these prices are tough to stomach they are not that surprising given Bora Bora's reputation as a pricey piece of paradise to visit.

Bottom line

I always thought Bora Bora would be a truly magical place to visit and my trip there did not disappoint. While you'll likely spend a considerable amount of money (or points and miles) to vacation here once you factor in flights to this remote tropical paradise and accommodations in a high-end option overlooking the lagoon if there is ever a destination to splurge on I would have to say that Bora Bora is it.

When you're not taking advantage of all your luxe resort has to offer you can explore the tranquil waters full of marine life or get your heart racing during an ATV excursion on land among other activities. Or you could just soak up some sun from the deck of your overwater bungalow and call it a day.

Regardless of what you end up doing the variety of experiences and truly world-class accommodations should ensure that your trip there will be just as enjoyable as mine was.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS91cGdyYWRlcy1vbi1zcGlyaXQtYWlybGluZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to upgrade your seat on Spirit Airlines,"Unlike most other discount carriers Spirit Airlines has a much more comfortable seat at the front of its planes. And Spirit's marketing of this seat may be the most honest in the travel industry. Dubbed the ""Big Front Seat"" you get what you'd expect: a big seat in the front of the plane. And it's pretty comfy.

You won't get free drinks or free checked bags with the Big Front Seat. And there aren't any free Spirit upgrades to the Big Front Seat even for elite members. But you can buy your way to a nicer seat.

An upgrade to a Big Front Seat isn't as cheap as it used to be but you may still find the cost reasonable. Even if you're traveling on a small budget and want to buy a Spirit upgrade you may find an exit-row seat that's in your price range. Here's what you need to know to give yourself the best chance at an affordable upgrade to more legroom when flying Spirit Airlines.

Buy a Spirit upgrade to the Big Front Seat

There are two ways to get a Spirit upgrade to the Big Front Seat. You can purchase a Big Front Seat assignment outright either during the booking process or after you complete your booking. You can also use Spirit's bidding system to bid on a Big Front Seat which I'll discuss in a subsequent section.

Discount carrier Spirit Airlines charges a fee for just about everything including seat assignments. You'll see a seat map with prices attached to each empty seat during the booking process.

Once you select a seat and pay for it you're all set. Spirit advertises a price range of $12 to $250 to select a Big Front Seat. In practice we typically see a range between $50 and $150 with many popular routes charging $100 or more per flight segment for the Big Front Seat.

As a general rule with Spirit seat assignment fees are nonrefundable. So make sure you're very likely to take your trip before committing to an upgrade.

The Free Spirit® Travel More World Elite Mastercard® doesn't offer any discounts or benefits regarding Spirit upgrades. But you can still utilize many other credit card travel credits to cover seat selection fees. For example the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers a $300 annual travel credit and The Platinum Card® from American Express offers an airline fee credit (although you'd need to enroll and select Spirit as your airline of choice before making your purchase).

Buy a Spirit upgrade to the exit row

There are several ways to pay for an upgrade to the exit row. The first similar to the Big Front Seat is to pay for an exit-row seat during seat selection. Spirit lists the price range for paid seat assignments from $1 to $50 (excluding the Big Front Seat). Typically you'll pay $25 to $35 to select an exit-row seat.

The other way to upgrade to an exit-row seat is to purchase one of the bundles Spirit offers during the booking process. Generally speaking you'll be offered two bundles during the booking process. Both the more affordable ""Just For You"" bundle and the pricier ""Bundle It"" bundle include the ability to pick any seat on the plane (excluding a Big Front Seat).

(Screenshot from spirit.com)

For folks who plan to bring a carry-on or checked bag bundle pricing that includes an exit-row seat can provide good value.

Bid on an upgrade to a Big Front Seat or exit-row seat

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Until recently the only way you could grab a Big Front Seat or exit-row seat on Spirit was to purchase it. However Spirit has rolled out a bidding system that may allow you to snag a Spirit upgrade for slightly less cash. TPG's Zach Griff tried bidding on a Big Front Seat and saved 40% on the advertised price.

After you book your flight Spirit has a webpage where you can bid for an upgrade to the exit row or a Big Front Seat. You won't hear whether your bid was successful until within 48 hours of departure (it may be even closer to departure).

Interestingly the terms and conditions of the Spirit bidding system also mention something called ""Instant Level Up."" Instant Level Up is an option where Spirit may offer you the opportunity to purchase an upgraded seat immediately during the bidding process. Spirit's website notes that the Instant Level Up option is only available on select routes.

Get a free Spirit upgrade to exit-row seating with elite status

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

If you fly Spirit frequently and earn elite status with Spirit Airlines you'll enjoy a few perks for your efforts. Don't confuse these perks with status on United or American as you won't find yourself with a free Spirit upgrade to the Big Front Seat. But with enough Spirit flying you may be able to snag a free upgrade to the exit row.

The Free Spirit program has two elevated levels you can earn: Gold and Silver. Free Spirit Silver members have a chance at a free upgrade to an exit row but it'll take a bit of luck. Three hours before departure Free Spirit Silver members can upgrade for free if an exit-row seat is available. Meanwhile Free Spirit Gold members get a much more useful benefit: They can select exit-row seats when booking.

Bottom line

Spirit has options if you want a more comfortable seat but many of them will cost you money. The Big Front Seat is the closest you'll get to a Spirit upgrade and you won't get it for free regardless of whether you carry the Spirit credit card or have elite status in the Free Spirit program.

Now that Spirit has more long-haul flights the comfort of an exit row seat can be worth the extra cash. I'm intrigued by Spirit's bidding system for upgrades to the exit row and Big Front Seat. Maybe when air travel slows down just a bit bidding on an upgrade will be a good way for travelers to save a few bucks on the comfort they crave.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL2ZyYW5rZnVydC1haXJwb3J0LWhvdGVsLXJvdW5kdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Battle of the Frankfurt Airport hotels: Which Hilton or Marriott is best?,"If you're flying through Frankfurt Airport (FRA) during this summer of European travel disruptions chances are you've thought about the nearby hotel options in case your travel plans go awry while at this busy hub.

Although it's never great to get stranded abroad at an airport the good news is that there are four convenient lodging options within walking distance of the airport's Terminal 1 from which Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners as well as some other major carriers fly.

Marriott Bonvoy members can choose from either the Frankfurt Airport Marriott or the Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel and Conference Center while those with Hilton Honors accounts might look toward the Hilton Frankfurt Airport or the Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport. All four are solid choices but we wondered how they stacked up against each other.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

To answer that question we spent a night hotel hopping among the four of them. Here's who each of these four hotels will be best for — and what you can expect at each one.

The Marriott match-up

First up our take on Marriott Bonvoy's conjoined hotels just across from the airport's Terminal 1.

Frankfurt Airport Marriott Hotel

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

Best for: Tired travelers willing to spend more for a cushy stay without a long journey between Terminal 1 and a bed.

Location: Frankfurt Airport Terminal 1. Simply take an escalator up from the departures level walk across an enclosed pedestrian bridge and make a right into the shared entrance of the Marriott and the Sheraton then veer off to the left toward the Marriott's lobby. The time from hotel to terminal? A mere two minutes.

The price point: At 170 euros ($173) for a one-night Deluxe King room stay in the first week of June the price was well worth the experience. Award nights through Marriott's Bonvoy loyalty program will cost 31000-41000 points apiece depending on the date.

The vibe: The lobby was beautiful and had a chic and classy vibe compared to the hectic hallways of Frankfurt Airport. The warm neutrals and mixture of suede leather and wood materials presented a comfy — and somewhat sexy — respite from the hustle and bustle of travel. The sitting area looked like the living room of a well-off Manhattanite who had just a little bit too much money to spend on furniture.

The dining area felt fresh and even worthy of an Instagram post thanks to the sophisticated contrast of the green leather seating and the yellow glassware the brass fixtures and the airiness of the skylit space. Just beware the mid-morning rush when large groups of travelers tend to clog the area waiting to check out.

It truly felt like a little haven away from the chaos of travel which we all know too well. Though the hotel shares some common public areas with the Sheraton around the corner it still felt individualistic and approachable and the staff was accommodating enough to enable an early check-in.

The rooms: The decor was straightforward but with little quirks like quotes by Goethe (a Frankfurt native) on the walls and the industrial nature of the design felt like a deliberate allusion to the nearby airport. A decent-size desk was excellent for getting some work done during a layover and the in-room Krups espresso machine with complimentary coffee pods and accompaniments can be a jetlag-busting lifesaver.

The gray-tiled bathroom lay somewhere between institutional and oasis-like with a basin-style sink a backlit vanity and half-glassed-in shower whose steady water pressure made sudsing up with the provided thisworks products a refreshing experience.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 8 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Drinking and dining: The hotel's public amenities many of which are shared with the adjacent Sheraton felt upscale and private providing a nice respite from the crowds circulating throughout the busy airport. The Eatery Kitchen and Bar which connects the Marriott with the Sheraton is open for lunch and dinner and is centered around a bright atrium with plenty of counter and restaurant-style seating to either side of the central bar. At one end there was a Starbucks outlet for caffeine on the go though the restaurant serves food and drinks throughout the day and evening including fresh items like Caesar salad with grilled chicken ($26) pan-fried hake with Dijon sauce ($31) and a Marriott signature burger ($25).

Guests can partake of breakfast at the Sheraton including a copious selection of rolls assorted sausages and a crowd favorite chocolate museli though expect a hefty bill of 32 euros ($33) per person if you don't get free breakfast through elite status.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 9 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Overall: The lobby was chic the service was spot on and the food options were varied and fresh especially after a decent amount of travel and eating on the go. The room decor was more playful than you might expect and though the hotel was more expensive than the Sheraton the upsell is well worth it.

Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel & Conference Center

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

Best for: More budget-minded Bonvoy loyalists looking for a better-priced but just as convenient option as the Marriott.

Location: You can access the hotel from Terminal 1 the same way you get to the Marriott only head right instead of left to get to its lobby.

The price point: We paid 149 euros ($152) for a one-night stay in early June in a standard king room. (Cash rates are now considerably higher though that might be the summer rush.) Points redemptions range from 22000 to 30000 points per night for a standard room in the next few months.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

The vibe: Despite a new and attractive lobby this large hotel — it was originally 1008 rooms before the Marriott was carved out of it in 2020 — has guestrooms and hallways that are drab (but certainly functional). The maze of corridors were dimly lit and spartan with the exception of room number signs featuring an airplane motif — an obvious reminder that yes you are staying at an airport hotel.

This hotel shares common areas a fitness center and a restaurant with the Marriott. It's an example of some brand synergy in the Marriott portfolio that was made possible by the company's 2016 acquisition of Starwood — of which Sheraton was a part.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 9 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The rooms: Standard rooms live up to that categorization measuring approximately 291 square feet with standard if quickly aging accouterments like king-size beds with blonde wood frames woven fabric headboards and well-worn white linens. Business travelers can get some work done at awkwardly placed (yet well-powered) elliptical wooden desks and stay ahead of jetlag thanks to the provided tea and coffee supplies (no espresso machines here). The wall-mounted televisions have streaming capabilities. Sparse by comparison the almost clinical (and glaringly lit) bathrooms wouldn't look out of place in a hospital ward and have hard-to-navigate shower-tub combos though the (somewhat confusing) mix of Le Grand Bain and Acca Kappa bath products are an overall plus.

Dining and drinking: The Sheraton shares a lobby with the Marriott along with the Eatery. Its signature burger is a sizzling patty placed on a tasty sourdough roll with a bowl of crispy fries. Though tempting the berry tarte flambee ($14) looks more like a berry-topped pizza than the Alsatian delight it's meant to be.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

Overall: The Sheraton tends to be priced much lower than the Marriott -- often 100 euros ($101) less per night -- but shares the same location and amenities. If you can forgo a newer fresher room then this hotel is a great value.

The Hilton head-to-head

Next up we checked into Hilton's sibling properties at the Squaire a dramatic spaceship-like office building with a few shops and restaurants that is connected to the airport and its train station via an indoor walkway.

Hilton Frankfurt Airport

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

Best for: Hilton Honors members who don't mind spending 10 more minutes walking to the airport along with spending a few extra euros on a slightly elevated hotel experience

Location: The Hilton Frankfurt Airport is located in the architecturally singular Squaire Germany's largest office building which itself is built on top of the Frankfurt Airport's long-distance train station. It's about a 10-minute walk from Terminal 1 and about a five-minute walk past the entrance to the Marriott and Sheraton via the enclosed pedestrian bridge that connects the airport and the train station. There are a few more escalators and turns to navigate but great signage makes it easy to get between the hotel and airport. The building has a mall-like atmosphere with some stores and restaurants. A Burger King and Starbucks are located right outside the hotel entrance with a Rossmann drugstore nearby for purchasing any needed travel essentials.

(Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy)

The price point: Rates in early June were 161 euros ($164) for a one-night stay in a standard queen room. (Cash rates are now considerably higher.) At check-in an upgrade to a standard king room was offered for just 5 euros ($5.09). This hotel participates in the Hilton Honors program with award stays that range from 32000 to 70000 points per night for a standard room in the coming months.

The vibe: The architecturally interesting lobby almost feels like something out of a futuristic science fiction movie. It's also a bit sterile: The airy open space could use a bit more furniture and lacked much seating. The lobby bar was closed during our stay in early June and was only used for a few hours each evening to host the hotel's evening reception for elite Hilton Honors members. Re-opening that bar might work wonders for livening up the lobby.

In contrast to the two Bonvoy properties this hotel never felt particularly crowded despite being located so close to one of Europe's busiest airports. One big downside to the design is that the stunning glass-enclosed lobby isn't air conditioned which creates a greenhouse effect — making it very hot in the late spring afternoon sun.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 12 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

The rooms: Rooms are bright and large if slightly impersonal with neutral-toned woods and upholstery — though the boldly patterned carpeting and bright red modernistic wingback chairs provide a little character. The large glass desks feel outdated at this point but provided plenty of room to work with a flatscreen TV mounted right above. Bathrooms are spacious and include both a soaking tub with tiled backsplash and a separate walk-in shower stocked with fragrant Crabtree & Evelyn products. Sizable closets well-stocked minibars and easy-to-use hot water kettles with instant coffee complete the business traveler's trifecta of in-room amenities. My exterior-facing room had a view of the autobahn and ironically the Sheraton.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 8 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Drinking and dining: The hotel's main eatery is Rise restaurant located near the massive lobby. At the time of our stay Rise had limited hours and offered different buffets throughout the day. The 34 euro ($35) breakfast buffet was both expensive and extensive — a good value for those with Hilton Gold status and above who receive a food and beverage credit as part of their elite perks and a pricey splurge for everyone else. The buffet's vast selection of breakfast breads cold cuts pancakes sausages and yogurts should have options for every appetite. However more budget-conscious travelers might want to skip this indulgence and grab a much less expensive breakfast sandwich at the Burger King or one of the other grab-and-go establishments nearby.

Overall: Aside from its singular setting there's not much to distinguish the Hilton Frankfurt Airport from a Hilton anywhere else in the world. The decor is somewhat bland and the in-room amenities are fine if unremarkable. That said this could be a decent use of points when room rates soar during busy times of year and a bargain at other times.

Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

Best for: Thrifty travelers who want to earn or burn Hilton points at an affordable rate.

Location: Follow the directions above for Hilton Frankfurt Airport but turn left immediately before entering the lobby of the Hilton.

The price point: The rate for a queen room was 151 euros ($154) with a Hilton Honors discount or 27000-50000 points per night which is not expensive but perhaps not merited by the amenities and accommodations on offer. The general atmosphere felt aloof and the color combinations of bright green accents with red and brown sprinkled throughout come off as both generic and odd. It made the design feel like an afterthought which also made the hotel feel impersonal. This is definitely a pass-through hotel but if you only need it for a quick stay then maybe it's the winner.

The vibe: Small and stark the lobby had a few squared-off sofas for lounging by the no-nonsense check-in desks but did not feel like a place to hang out. The hotel does deserve a plus for glass elevators that whisk you up to guest rooms through the central atrium.

The rooms: Rooms feel slightly smaller and more basic than at the next-door Hilton. The office chairs felt like Staples castoffs while solid wooden desks and bed frames aren't quite offset by the dim accent lighting. The bathrooms are more compact than at the Hilton with shower-tub combinations rather than separate installations (though you can still enjoy the same Crabtree & Evelyn products). Fancy a preflight cup of coffee? You'll find the same instant coffee kettle setup as at the Hilton.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

Drinking and dining: The Restaurant is closed at the moment for lunch and dinner (this is described as all-day dining on its website but with its hours listed as 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.). You can visit it for breakfast when it offers an American buffet for 25 euros ($26). There are also paid grab-and-go options from the Pavillion Pantry which offers a selection of snacks and sweet treats. Hilton Garden Inn guests also can venture over to the neighboring Hilton to eat according to a front desk manager.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

Overall: If you just need a quick rest before or between flights and don't care about other amenities the Hilton Garden Inn Frankfut Airport is just fine. However if you're going to spend any time in your room or want a convenient on-site restaurant (without having to venture out into the Squaire) then you'll probably be better off at the Hilton.

Checking out

If you're traveling through Frankfurt Airport you certainly have some solid hotel options in case you get stuck there unexpectedly.

The Frankfurt Airport Marriott has an unbeatable location and is the newest of the hotels; a beautiful spotless property with a thoughtful design.

The Hilton Frankfurt Airport is a farther walk from the terminal but also a winner with nice-enough design and highly functional rooms. Food and beverage options at this property are pricey and limited but many other options abound just outside the front door.

The third full-service property the Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel & Conference Center is co-located with the Marriott and also is very convenient though its dark dated design and sterile bathrooms leave a bit to be desired.

Finally budget-conscious travelers should be satisfied with the Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport which is at a lower price point than its full-service neighbors but does not sacrifice the convenience.

If you end up staying at one of these properties we sure hope you're there willingly and not because an airline meltdown sent you there. But in any case we're glad to report that you shouldn't have a problem enjoying a decent stay at any of them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9zcGlyaXQtYWlybGluZXMtcGV0LXBvbGljeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spirit Airlines pet policy: How to fly with a pet on Spirit,"Looking to take your pet with you on your next trip?

Spirit Airlines' pet policy

(Photo by GabrielPevide/Getty Images)

According to the Spirit pet policy domesticated dogs and cats can fly on Spirit Airlines flights throughout the U.S. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. And while small ""household birds"" (excluding such things as chickens and ducks) and small domestic rabbits are allowed to fly in-cabin on Spirit these pets can only fly domestically (not to or from Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands).

Additionally Spirit doesn't allow any animals to fly as cargo. So unfortunately larger dogs can't fly on Spirit according to the Spirit Airlines dog policy.

All pets must be at least eight weeks old and fully weaned from their mother. Additionally health certificates are required for pets flying to the U.S. Virgin Islands and a rabies vaccination certificate is required when traveling to Puerto Rico.

While Spirit doesn't allow any pets to fly on international flights service animals can fly internationally.

When flying with an approved pet on Spirit you may choose any seat except the first row and the emergency exit row. Your pet must remain in its carrier for the entire flight can't require attention and must be ""harmless inoffensive and odorless.""

Booking your pet on a Spirit Airlines flight

(Photo by Bread and Butter Productions/Getty Images)

Spirit Airlines charges a fee of $125 one-way to bring a pet with you in the cabin. Reservations are recommended but not required. However it is probably best to reserve a spot for your pet on the plane as soon as possible since Spirit doesn't allow more than six pet carriers per flight. To add a pet to your reservation contact Spirit directly.

When checking in at the airport with your pet the Spirit Airlines pet policy states you'll need to visit the ticket counter (curbside or self-service check in isn't allowed). When you visit the ticket counter a Spirit agent will inspect and approve both your pet and its carrier.

Spirit Airlines' pet carrier requirements

(Photo by vasiliki/Getty Images)

When traveling on Spirit you may bring two similar pets if they can fit in one pet carrier. The carrier must be large enough to allow the pet (or pets) to stand and turn around. Only soft-sided carriers are allowed — although the type that allows the pet's head to poke outside is prohibited — and the dimensions cannot exceed 18 inches by 14 inches by nine inches.

You must place the carrier under the seat in front of you and keep it there for the entire flight. Additionally per the Spirit pet policy the pet and carrier have a combined weight restriction of 40 pounds.

Due to Spirit's baggage policy your pet carrier will count as one of the items you're allowed to bring on board. So you can only bring a personal item (for free) or a carry-on item (with the associated fee) — not both — in addition to your pet carrier.

Bottom line

Thanks to the relatively generous Spirit Airlines pet policy you can bring your dog (as long as it's small enough) cat rabbit or bird with you on most flights. And despite Spirit charging a pretty penny for anything ""extra"" during your travels the fee to bring your pet with you is similarly priced to the other major U.S. airlines (although on the higher end of the scale)."

Like diamonds they control the release of their precious resources making purchasing and owning one a special and exciting opportunity. BMW USA Classic Manager Thomas Plucinsky noted “I only need the fingers on one hand to count the few factory race cars that have left the ownership of BMW in recent years.”

It just so happens that the rare opportunity to own one of these race cars is upon us. As part of its continuing 50th birthday celebration BMW M Motorsport will be selling the 2020 Rolex 24 At Daytona GTLM class-winning #24 BMW M8 GTE (Chassis Number 1809). This piece of recent racing history will be on display in the BMW USA Classic garage during Monterey Car Week August 17th – 20th.

Aside from rarity what makes owning one of BMW M Motorsport’s race cars so special? Plucinsky commented “The BMW M8 GTE represented a money-is-no-object factory GT race car. It is truly an engineering masterpiece. The new owner of BMW M8 GTE No. 1809 will be the steward of a very important piece of BMW history in America and can count on support from BMW in the years to come to ensure its condition and value are maintained at the highest level.” If I’m hearing this correctly BMW M Motorsport is including an extended warranty for whoever purchases this particular M8 GTE.

Even with an extended warranty it’s understandable to have concerns about buying a used car. To put your concerns at ease BMW M Motorsport had none other than Bill Auberlen the driver with the most races in a BMW and most victories in IMSA history test the M8 GTE at Palm Beach International Raceway. By “test” they mean it passed a multi-point inspection–just like at Carmax! I don’t know about you but I’m feeling more confident about this purchase now.

Victor Leleu Experiential Marketing Manager and former BMW NA Motorsport Manager said “Chassis number 1809 has an exceptional provenance having been built in preparation for the 2020 season and owns the distinction of winning its very first race – the Rolex 24 At Daytona – with drivers John Edwards Augusto Farfus Jesse Krohn and Chas Mostert. From that auspicious start it went onto scoring an additional five podium finishes to help BMW and BMW M Team RLL earn the Michelin Endurance Cup and finish second in the GTLM class Driver Team and Manufacturer points standings. 1809 also raced the Rolex 24 again at the start of the 2021 season finishing third.”

To go along with that provenance BMW M Motorsport will include “engineering notes press and marketing materials and of course the 2020 Rolex 24 trophy.” I always find it exciting when the seller has a binder of receipts and the original window sticker–it really shows they care. In addition “ it will be delivered with a vehicle running kit containing special tools needed to operate the car plus a spares package which includes an extra set of wheels and the typical consumables.”

It’s rare it’s well engineered it passed a Carmax-style Aulberlen multi-point inspection it comes with the original window sticker and it comes with an extended warranty. What else could you ask for? I suppose if you ask nicely BMW M Motorsport may be able to talk to their manager to see if they can throw in some all-weather mats to sweeten the deal. —Mike Bevels

It's Day 3 of our 4-night cruise and the weekend is flying by.

I can't believe we are able to be whisked away to Mexico over the weekend - one of the many reasons I love cruising and living in the south. It was so easy to get to the cruise port from my home that this really makes the perfect weekend getaway. With only 4 days to see and do everything we've been trying to squeeze in as much as possible.

Angie and I had another busy day both ashore in Cozumel and onboard Carnival Ecstasy!

The morning started early again for me. Between the combination of announcements noisy neighbors and loud people walking by the room I've had a hard time getting a good night's rest. I am pretty sure I could hear the shower from our neighbor's cabin blasting against our wall this morning. I normally sleep like an angel on cruises but not this one.

I think there are a few factors playing into this. First the walls are paper thin on this old ship and that's evident by how much noise we hear. Second I have to remember that people are here to party have a good time and drink lots of booze - so it’s not surprising to have a rowdy and loud clientele.

Angie sleeps with earplugs and hasn’t been woken up by any of the noises that I hear. So I’ll report tomorrow if using earplugs helps to solve my issue. Hoping for a restful night tonight!

Breakfast

We planned to get up in time for breakfast in the dining room which ended by 9:00 a.m this morning. This breakfast menu was different than the Sea Day Brunch but still looked like it had a nice selection of breakfast items.

Angie checked us in for breakfast on the app and our table was ready almost immediately. We made our way upstairs and seated ourselves at the table that the app assigned us to.

I started with a yogurt and granola - I’ve really enjoyed the granola on this ship; it tastes homemade! Angie and I both ordered breakfast sandwiches and a small plate of French toast and waffles to try.

The breakfast sandwiches were very good. Angie agreed the Sea Day french toast was better and the waffle was subpar again so we didn’t eat much of it.

Beach Club in Cozumel

Today we made a reservation to go to Del Mar Latino Beach Club which offers all-inclusive day passes to an exclusive small beach club.

When we got off the ship we were greeted by Carnival Breeze and Grandeur of the Seas. This is the oldest ship in Royal Caribbean’s fleet so she looked similar to our old ship. Carnival Breeze is 20 years newer and substantially bigger but our ship still looked nicely maintained even when compared to the others in port.

As we made our way along the port a big rain cloud popped up and it started to sprinkle. This quickly turned into a downpour so we waited it out in the duty free shipping terminal. It rained pretty hard but it cleared up quickly.

The resort website said it was within walking distance of the cruise port. Our phones said it would take 20 minutes to get there if we walked. We thought it was only 1/3 mile but I think that’s likely from the Royal Caribbean dock which looked closer.

Either way it was a quick walk there once we knew where we were going. Luckily I have cell service which we used to navigate to the Del Mar Latino Beach Club. This helped us feel confident as we walked along the street. Even though there weren’t many people walking we felt safe and got there within 20 minutes from getting off the ship.

Del Mar Latino Beach Club

When we arrived to the beach club one of the hostesses checked us in and we paid the day pass balance. It was only $39.95 per person and included unlimited drinks and food all day. There was a large pool overlooking the sea surrounded by loungers. There’s also a bar with high-top tables where you can order food.

We started the day with a mojito and piña coladas while it continued to rain for a bit. Once the rain stopped we dipped in the pool and tried a variety of drinks (margarita Miami vice tequila sunrise and dirty monkey). The service was great and all the drinks were delicious!

Angie and I ordered some food as it was getting closer to lunchtime. I loved the quesadilla and chicken tacos. Angie had chicken strips and French fries which also hit the spot after our drinks in the sun.

The only regret I have is not bringing a towel from the cruise ship. We thought these would be provided since we didn’t see it mention anywhere to bring your own towel. They were available to rent for $5 but we just did an old fashioned air dry instead.

It was great that the beach club was limited to just 30 people. It never felt crowded and it had a quiet laidback vibe. I loved how close the club was to the cruise port. There was another beach club we walked by on the way back to the ship that had a much louder atmosphere and many more people which could be fun as well.

For the price we paid we were super happy with the experience and I would definitely return in the future. If you prefer going to the beach this probably isn't a great option for you because there's not a beach. There are stairs to access to the ocean but we didn't get take advantage of this.

After spending about 4 hours at the resort we decided to make our way back to the ship. Luckily the rain cleared in the afternoon and we didn't get caught in any pop-up storms.

I decided to buy some cute little bottles of Mexican Vanilla to bring home and give as gifts in the duty free store.

Back Onboard

Once onboard I decided to take a nap while Angie worked on cruise blog social media content. There’s something about taking a mid-day nap in an inside cabin after a fun day in port. Gotta love a room that can be pitch black at any time of the day!

As Carnival does best there were multiple announcements during my nap. Most of them were calls for missing guests over the intercom. Apparently three people were almost left behind today - which is something I don’t normally see when I cruise but doesn’t surprise me with this crowd.

We were told by our dinner mates that they saw two people slumped over in a rickshaw/tuktuk both who had to be escorted back on the ship. They also thought they saw the pilot bring out another passenger to the ship as we had barely left port.

During my nap Angie tried out Music Trivia - she didn’t prevail unfortunately with a 12/30 score. We are hoping to try more trivia tomorrow. It's nice they have themes that are definitely geared towards younger people. We've noticed themes like 2000s music Harry Potter trivia The Office trivia Friends trivia and more.

Although I could have kept napping it was time for dinner so I rallied out of the bed and we were on our way.

Evening Onboard

Dinner tonight was delicious and service was much quicker which we all appreciated.

It’s a little hit or miss if our waiter brings us everything we ask for. I am sure they are understaffed like most cruise ships these days and he has two large tables. For instance I ordered a caprese salad with my appetizers and didn’t get it. This has happened both nights but it’s not a huge issue for us. No one's going hungry and everyone at our table is laidback so no one makes a stink over it.

Angie and I both tried the BBQ flatbread for an appetizer which we liked. Angie had the chicken wild rice soup and I tried the French onion - both good! For dinner Angie had the creamy stuffed chicken and I had the lasagna. For dessert the classic chocolate cake for me and apple pie for Angie. She didn’t care for the apple pie but the chocolate cake is a home run every night.

We ended the evening with a comedy show at Punchliner Comedy Club which was much better than the previous nights. There's a new comedian who we really enjoyed even for a family-friendly show. Also rowdy granny didn’t interrupt or make an appearance tonight so the show had a much better flow than the day prior.

After the comedian we made our way to the theatre for a classic viewing of the Love and Marriage game show. It was a riot with three couples who made it really fun.

After the Love and Marriage game show I came back to the cabin to get working on the live blog. Angie decided she wanted to go back to the adult's comedy show. She said they scanned cards to make sure everyone was over 18 to attend. The show was similar to the family friendly one with more colorful language.

It's nice that Carnival cruises offer nightly comedy shows for both families and adults-only. I remember enjoying this on my last Carnival cruise and this is still one of my favorite nightly activities.

Tomorrow we are at sea and heading back to Mobile. Angie and I plan to go to Sea Day Brunch again because we loved it so much the first day. We have a busy day planned making sure we try everything the ship has to offer!

Stray Observations

Not that this is any kind of scientific metric but Angie and I agreed that we haven't heard much coughing on this cruise at all. The dropped testing requirement was a welcome change for short-term cruises but I wasn't sure if it would change the vibe onboard. I am always listening for coughing on cruises as an indicator of Covid-19 potentially spreading. But we haven't heard much coughing if any at this point in the cruise. Hope this continues tomorrow and we stay healthy after returning home.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWNyaXRpYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3J1aXNlLWNyaXRpYy1leGNsdXNpdmUtbmV3LWNhcm5pdmFsLWNvcnAtY2VvLWtleXMtaW4tb24taGFwcGluZXNzLXdvbnQtcm9jay10aGUtYm9hdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise Critic Exclusive: Carnival Corporation CEO Josh Weinstein,"Josh Weinstein loves cruising. That's really important especially because he recently took the reins of Carnival Corporation whose nine cruise lines comprise the biggest cruise brand in the world.

But for Weinstein Carnival Corp.'s president and CEO since August 1 2022 it's not just about the numbers. He's a cruise fan and has been from the beginning when he took his first cruise as a new Carnival Cruise Line employee. That sailing was nearly 20 years ago when he was working for the company's legal team.

Ask Weinstein about that cruise and he lights up. You can hear the excitement in his voice as he speaks about that family cruise when he was finally able to connect what he was doing for Carnival with what it means to the people onboard the company's cruise ship. He calls it a ""light bulb"" moment and it continues to shape his decisions and direction even today.

""I remember being on a cruise experiencing it as a guest and seeing other guests and seeing our crew members interact with these folks"" Weinstein said. ""And we create happiness. That's our job. Our job is to make people happy. It was like an epiphany for me and as satisfied as I was with being part of a pretty fantastic team that has been something that's stayed with me for the last 20 years.""

In an exclusive interview with Cruise Critic the first outlet he's spoken with since taking over the CEO job Weinstein talks about how happiness drives his decision making what his long-term vision for the company is and why it's so important for each of the company's nine brands to maintain distinct personalities.

Married and the father of three teenagers Weinstein said he loves cruising for many of the same reasons we all do. It's a convenient way to see the world requiring packing and unpacking only once and he loves connecting to the people he sails with. He also talks about how cruising is ideal for group and extended family cruising allowing everyone to tailor the cruise experience for themselves.

Former Leadership Casts Big Shadow But Weinstein's No Rookie

Weinstein 48 has big shoes to fill. He's at the helm of a company that has seen only three CEOs before him: Founder Ted Arison his son Micky Arison who led the company for more than 30 years and Arnold Donald a beloved figure who was named CEO in 2013 when Micky Arison stepped down.

When Donald announced in April that he'd be leaving the CEO role this summer it had industry insiders buzzing. After all Richard Fain had recently left his position as head of Royal Caribbean Group (replaced by Jason Liberty) and Donald had been a steady hand as the cruise giant worked toward recovery through a pandemic that was harder on the cruise industry than on any other segment of travel.

To outsiders Weinstein as a replacement for Arnold Donald may have been a bit of a surprise but for those in the know it seemed like a no-brainer. Weinstein is a veteran of Carnival Corporation having started with the company two decades ago as legal counsel. He's had various roles since including almost a decade as the company's treasurer. He was president of Carnival U.K. leading Cunard and P&O Cruises for three years before being named chief operating officer. Weinstein took over as COO in June 2020 and is widely credited for helping lead the company through the global health pandemic.

Weinstein feels prepared for the role in part because he's learned from all the people he's worked with along the way including Donald CFO David Bernstein former Carnival Cruise Line President Bob Dickinson and current Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy.

""All of them just approach things differently think about the world differently"" Weinstein said. ""Their leadership styles are incredibly different. I think I've gone through a process over my career and a bit of a learning curve about. ... But I think what's common with all of them is they are so unique and they're so authentic. Every single one of them they are who they are and they don't try to be something that they're not.

""I can't be Bob Dickinson and I don't want to be. I can't be Arnold and I don't want to be.""

Weinstein's approach to leadership is part of the reason the company tapped him for the role and is so confident in his ability to steer Carnival Corporation toward a bright future.

Donald and Weinstein worked closely together over the years and Donald credits him with being ""very bright"" praising his transparency and openness.

In an interview with Cruise Critic in May 2022 Donald said of Weinstein ""he's different than me which is important and good. ... He's going to come at things a little bit differently.""

The fact that Weinstein's never held a similar position to his current role doesn't faze him. It's not the first time he's taken on a job for which he didn't have the background experience. He was named treasurer in 2007 and at the time he had no accounting finance or economic experience. But he learned relying on his team to help him learn how he could best support them. He said the same thing happened again when he led the UK team and when he was named COO.

""Part of the portion of the journey I had is that folks kept putting me into new roles that I had no background in"" Weinstein said adding ""I found myself working with some just incredibly talented folks ... who are just experts in their field and tremendous leaders and I get to learn from all of them.""

Carnival Corp's Nine Brands to Remain Distinct

Weinstein's background with a diversity of responsibilities and exposure to all of the company's brands has him uniquely positioned to lead. With a portfolio that includes Carnival Cruise Line Princess Cruises Holland America Line Seabourn Cunard Line P&O Cruises P&O Australia Costa Cruises and German-brand AIDA Carnival Corporation has cruise lines that satisfy nearly every taste.

In his first video message to his new employees Weinstein highlighted the importance of maintaining the distinct brands that authentically cater to their unique guest audiences. It's a cornerstone of Weinstein's long-term vision for the company.

""The same person who is looking for a three-night holiday on Carnival and fun boisterous loud in a very positive way is not necessarily the same person that's going to be looking to go on a Seabourn cruise to Antarctica"" Weinstein said.

Being able to provide options for all traveler tastes -- or at least as many as possible -- is both good for guests and good for business. Weinstein calls it the ""virtuous cycle"": Helping guests find the right line for them and delivering onboard on that promise makes it more likely they'll return again and again.

To that end Weinstein will continue to put much of the information-gathering and decision-making around each brand in the hands of those closest to them those who know the brands well.

Happiness is at the Core of Carnival Corp.

If you ask Weinstein what gets him excited each day his response will revolve around ""happiness.""

The surprisingly simple concept applies across the business to passengers and to employees. For guests it means delivering the best experience possible making sure smiles are big and expectations are exceeded.

""And all of our brands do it differently right? Because that idea of what is it that creates happiness for somebody who's on a Carnival cruise versus an AIDA cruise? It's all different and that's great. It should be different because it's a different target audience just like we've been talking about"" Weinstein said. ""But that's what we do and that's gotten me out of bed every single day for the last 20 years.""

But passenger satisfaction is just part -- albeit a big part -- of the equation. Weinstein says his aim is to keep employees happy as well because what he loves about cruising is the same thing that has many of us sailing again and again: the people. His goal is to create and maintain a workplace that offers a culture that encourages diversity personal and business growth and continuous training.

His ultimate goal is making Carnival the employer of choice in the travel and leisure industry.

""And trying to care for ... one another make sure that we are giving our team members the resources that they need training tools career growth not only to come start with us but stay with us becoming a more-inclusive environment seeking out different people's perspectives at all levels"" Weinstein said. ""All of those things will help us to achieve that. There's no silver bullet. It's just consistent improvement and focus on the people and what they need to succeed. That is a huge pillar for us as a company for me personally.""

Up First: Changing a Way of Thinking

As Weinstein thinks about the future one area of focus is on shifting mentality moving from a mindframe that helped the company successfully get back to service during the pandemic to one that drives a return to strong profitability.

Like virtually the entire cruise industry Carnival Corporation took on debt -- to the tune of roughly $35 billion -- during the pandemic. So the shift in mentality is certainly an understandable one.

The entire cruise industry was paused in March 2020 and for most brands cruising only started its slow return in late spring/early summer 2021. Ninety percent of the Carnival Corp. fleet is sailing and the remainder is expected to return by the end of the year Weinstein said. Speaking of the incredible uphill battle the cruise industry faced in return to service Weinstein is effusive in his praise of the determination perseverance resiliency and creativity that went into getting to this point.

""I can't understate how monumental that is"" he said. ""And at the same time it's hard to do but we have to almost compartmentalize that now and say 'Great we did whatever we needed to do to get back into service.' Now that we are here we can take a breath. ... It's our job to say 'Right now we get back to business.' ""

Part of the ""getting back to business"" connects directly to the company's drive to make people happy something Weinstein notes Carnival -- and the industry -- was unable to do for a year. But now delivering happiness will serve as a springboard to generate ""incredible amounts of revenue.""

With the elimination of CDC restrictions which held back a full cruise return for more than two years Weinstein believes the company is poised for profitability. Like the rest of the cruise industry Carnival Corp. had a number of rules in place including testing and vaccination mandates which the company is now ""responsibly relaxing.""

And that same thinking that has helped the company through the pandemic that creativity determination inclusivity and empowerment will now help secure Carnival Corporation's short- and long-term future.

""It's all just tools in the tool belt that are going to make us that much more successful in the future"" Weinstein said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLWRyb3BzLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtcmVxdWlyZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line drops COVID-19 vaccine requirement for most sailings,"Carnival Cruise Line is joining Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line in dropping its COVID-19 vaccine requirement.

But like the latter lines it'll still make you show proof of one for some sailings.

The world's second-largest cruise line late Friday said that effective Sept. 6 it no longer would require passengers to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccine for all voyages except those departing from Australia and cruises that are 16 nights in length or longer.

Unvaccinated travelers who want to sail out of Australia or on a 16-night-plus voyage will be able to apply for a vaccine exemption.

Carnival also announced that vaccinated passengers no longer will have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test to board its ships in most places. The line said testing will still be required for vaccinated passengers in advance of cruises to Canada Bermuda Greece and Australia per local regulations in those countries and on voyages of 16 nights or longer.

In addition all unvaccinated passengers will still have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test before sailing. The test must be taken within three days of embarkation.

A few caveats to the new rules that Carnival spelled out in its announcement:

All of the new policies are subject to local destination regulations.

Passengers under the age of five will be exempt from all vaccination and testing requirements on sailings from the United States.

Passengers under the age of 12 will be exempt from all vaccination and testing requirements on sailings from Australia.

Voyages of 16 nights and longer will continue to have vaccination and testing requirements that are specific to the itinerary.

""These guidelines will make it a simpler process and make cruising accessible for those who were not able to meet the protocols we were required to follow for much of the past 14 months"" Carnival President Christine Duffy said in a statement.

Duffy added that Carnival is in the process of updating its website communications and internal processes and sharing more details with passengers and travel agents to reflect the new policies.

""We appreciate the patience of our guests and travel advisor partners as we update all materials but the end result is a very positive one for all who are looking forward to cruising with us"" she said.

Carnival's announcement came just two days after the world's largest cruise line Royal Caribbean and sister line Celebrity Cruises announced they were dropping their COVID-19 vaccine requirement for many but not all sailings effective Sept. 5. Norwegian Cruise Line and sister lines Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Oceania Cruises on Monday dropped their vaccine requirements for many sailings effective Sept. 3.

Carnival sister brand Princess Cruises on Friday also announced that it would remove its vaccine requirement for most voyages of fewer than 16 days effective Sept. 6.

According to the Spirit pet policy domesticated dogs and cats can fly on Spirit Airlines flights throughout the U.S. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. And while small ""household birds"" (excluding such things as chickens and ducks) and small domestic rabbits are allowed to fly in-cabin on Spirit these pets can only fly domestically (not to or from Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands).

Additionally Spirit doesn't allow any animals to fly as cargo. So unfortunately larger dogs can't fly on Spirit according to the Spirit Airlines dog policy.

All pets must be at least eight weeks old and fully weaned from their mother. Additionally health certificates are required for pets flying to the U.S. Virgin Islands and a rabies vaccination certificate is required when traveling to Puerto Rico.

While Spirit doesn't allow any pets to fly on international flights service animals can fly internationally.

When flying with an approved pet on Spirit you may choose any seat except the first row and the emergency exit row. Your pet must remain in its carrier for the entire flight can't require attention and must be ""harmless inoffensive and odorless.""

Spirit Airlines charges a fee of $125 one-way to bring a pet with you in the cabin. Reservations are recommended but not required. However it is probably best to reserve a spot for your pet on the plane as soon as possible since Spirit doesn't allow more than six pet carriers per flight. To add a pet to your reservation contact Spirit directly.

When checking in at the airport with your pet the Spirit Airlines pet policy states you'll need to visit the ticket counter (curbside or self-service check in isn't allowed). When you visit the ticket counter a Spirit agent will inspect and approve both your pet and its carrier.

Spirit Airlines' pet carrier requirements

When traveling on Spirit you may bring two similar pets if they can fit in one pet carrier. The carrier must be large enough to allow the pet (or pets) to stand and turn around. Only soft-sided carriers are allowed — although the type that allows the pet's head to poke outside is prohibited — and the dimensions cannot exceed 18 inches by 14 inches by nine inches.

You must place the carrier under the seat in front of you and keep it there for the entire flight. Additionally per the Spirit pet policy the pet and carrier have a combined weight restriction of 40 pounds.

Due to Spirit's baggage policy your pet carrier will count as one of the items you're allowed to bring on board. So you can only bring a personal item (for free) or a carry-on item (with the associated fee) — not both — in addition to your pet carrier.

Bottom line

Thanks to the relatively generous Spirit Airlines pet policy you can bring your dog (as long as it's small enough) cat rabbit or bird with you on most flights. And despite Spirit charging a pretty penny for anything ""extra"" during your travels the fee to bring your pet with you is similarly priced to the other major U.S. airlines (although on the higher end of the scale).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzE0L2J1c2luZXNzL3NvbWVydmlsbGUtc3RhcnR1cC1oYXMtY29vbC10YWtlLWFpci1jb25kaXRpb25pbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Somerville startup has a cool take on air conditioning,"Transaera and a handful of other startups is working to design air conditioners that require dramatically less energy. This month the company plans to announce that it has raised an initial funding round of $4.5 million. One of its backers is Carrier Global Corp. the publicly traded Florida company whose founder is credited with inventing modern air conditioning systems in the early 20th century.

As the planet warms more people want it. According to the International Energy Agency a Paris-based intergovernmental organization the demand for AC could triple by 2050 driven largely by consumers in China India and Indonesia. And cooling technologies like AC and electric fans account for about 20 percent of the energy consumption in buildings the IEA notes. That produces more carbon dioxide emissions which accelerate warming which spurs more demand for cooling. It’s quite the negative feedback loop.

Transaera’s founder Sorin Grama is one of the godfathers of Boston’s clean energy startup ecosystem. In 2007 he cofounded a company called Promethean Power Systems which developed and sold a new kind of milk chiller in India one that doesn’t require a dirty diesel generator to keep the milk collected from farms cold. In 2010 looking for a workspace where Promethean could build and test its prototype chillers Grama helped start Greentown Labs in a vacant building that once housed a printing operation. Greentown is now the country’s biggest incubator for clean energy companies with about 125 tenants — including Transaera.

After extracting himself from the day-to-day operations of Promethean Grama says he began “casting about for some new ideas to work on but eventually I came back to cooling.” Grama met an MIT professor Mircea Dincă who was studying a kind of porous crystalline material called a metal-organic framework or MOF. Grama and Dincă cofounded Transaera in 2018 and supported their early work with about $2 million in state and federal grants from agencies that included the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center.

Gram and Dincă decided to focus on air conditioning in part because of the Global Cooling Prize competition which ponied up $3 million in prize money to incentivize startups and large companies to design radically more efficient air conditioners. (Transaera was not one of the two winners but it was one of eight finalists.) A key to their design was using the MOF material as a kind of sponge to pull moisture — aka humidity — out of the air.

Holding up a small test tube of MOF powder Ross Bonner Transaera’s chief technology officer says that the powder inside has “roughly the same surface area as a football field.” MOF is a kind of desiccant — not unlike the silica gel that is used in packaging food or electronics to keep moisture out. But when MOF absorbs water molecules it “doesn’t hold onto the water tightly” Bonner explains. Using heat that is already circulating in the air conditioning unit he says it can release those water molecules trapped by the MOF material as water vapor. The vapor is expelled from the unit.

Grama explains that the MOF material is what makes Transaera’s air conditioner more energy efficient; today’s air conditioners require more electricity to pull water from the air and turn it into a liquid. “It’s beneficial from an energy standpoint but it’s also a feature: without water there are no drips no mold and no leaks” he says. The company’s objective is to deliver the same cooling power as a traditional air conditioner with half the energy usage Grama says. The air conditioner also uses a refrigerant called R32 to cool the air which is more environmentally friendly than those commonly used today. (Refrigerants are a potent greenhouse gas that can leak during use or when the device is improperly disposed of.)

MOF powders have only been around for about 20 years and a big part of Transaera’s “secret sauce” is how the MOF material is applied to a surface inside the air conditioner so it can act as a sponge. “The challenge is to make the coating rugged and durable enough to survive for the life of the device so it won’t come right off” Grama says.

The cost and scalability of using MOF material in air conditioners in high-volume production could be an issue says Michael Holman a vice president who focuses on energy and manufacturing at Lux Research a Boston-based analyst firm. “I know there are lots of claims from different firms to have innovations that will solve this but we haven’t really seen it proven yet” Holman writes via e-mail.

Transaera envisions developing this technology and licensing it to companies that already have manufacturing facilities and distribution channels — among them are Carrier and Windmill a New York startup.

Energy Impact Partners one of the investment funds that is putting money into Transaera discovered the company through the Global Cooling Challenge. Ashwin Shashindranath a partner at EIP says he was attracted to the company because its technology can be used in a variety of products — not just air conditioners for homes but rooftop units for commercial buildings and built-in wall units found in hotels.

“The air conditioning space is dominated by large companies incumbents that have been working on evolutionary technology changes over time ― and nothing revolutionary” Shashindranath says.

With temperatures in many parts of the world setting records “This is the summer that air conditioning is getting the attention it needs” Grama says. “You’re seeing investors more interested” in a sector that was once considered “kind of a backwater.”

But that will create competitors for Transaera — among them Florida-based Blue Frontier which announced a $20 million funding round earlier this month. Its focus is rooftop air conditioners for big buildings and among its investors is Breakthrough Energy Ventures an investment vehicle created by Bill Gates in 2016.

Carmichael Roberts based in Boston helps choose the startups that Breakthrough puts money into. As “air conditioning makes the transition from a luxury product to a utility product” in many developing economies Roberts says there is a real need for new approaches to energy efficiency. But air conditioning is a conservative market where price matters — a lot he adds.

“This just means it is going to take real breakthroughs to make headway” Roberts says.

Several airlines seek to tap growing demand for biz and education travel

After a hiatus of more than two years more international flights to and from China restarted this month after the country's aviation regulator decided to relax rules－this bodes well for the recovery of a sector hurt by COVID-19 and subsequent losses industry experts said on Friday.

Direct flights between China and the United Kingdom resumed on Thursday after a gap of more than 18 months following negotiations between the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the UK's Department for Transport the British Embassy in Beijing said on Wednesday.

Air China took the lead by restarting direct flights between Beijing and London on Thursday followed by China Eastern Airlines that relaunched services from Shanghai to London on Friday while China Southern Airlines announced flights from Guangzhou to London from Aug 17.

Flights to other European destinations also resumed. Hainan Airlines announced restoration of direct flights between Beijing and Berlin on Friday. This is the Hainan-based carrier's fourth regular intercontinental flight to resume service from Beijing or surrounding areas since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out according to Securities Daily.

""The resumption of these international flights resulted from China's constantly optimized measures for containing COVID-19 which has boosted confidence of carriers to restore more outbound flights"" said Zheng Hongfeng founder and CEO of aviation data and solutions provider Vari-Flight.

The CAAC said on Sunday that any flight with five detected COVID-19 cases will be suspended for one week when the confirmed cases account for 4 percent of all those onboard and for two weeks when the confirmed cases account for 8 percent of those on board.

The decision took effect on Sunday. It adjusted the suspension standard from the number of people to the proportion of all passengers onboard. This change allows carriers to speed up their international flight resumption Zheng said.

International long-haul flights are usually operated with larger passenger aircraft so it is more reasonable to take the percentage of affected cases into consideration said Qi Qi an associate professor at Guangzhou Civil Aviation College.

There is urgent demand for travel related to business overseas education and family visits so relaxation of international flights will be good news for certain people said Lin Zhijie an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc.com one of China's biggest civil aviation websites.

As measures are eased on international trips aviation firms at home and abroad have sped up their international operations Lin said.

Air China announced it will gradually restart flights between Shanghai and London Beijing and Seoul Beijing and Frankfurt and Beijing and Tokyo from Friday.

For its part China Eastern Airlines restored a couple of direct flights to international cities earlier this month. The Shanghai-based carrier said it will raise the number of its international flights per week to 45 from 40 at the moment.

""In addition to our existing flights between overseas destinations and China Juneyao Air has started an evaluation on relaunch of more international flights and we will restore flights once the time is ripe"" said Cheng Xi vice-general manager of the commercial department with Juneyao Air.

Owing to the uncertainties of the COVID-19 outbreaks it remains a challenge for the aviation industry to strike a balance between contagion containment and staying profitable Lin said.

""The recovery may take place gradually and steadily"" Zheng said adding international passenger flights across China surged about 30 percent in July from the level of May but a mere 3 percent from the pre-pandemic level."

Millipedes With More Than 1000 Legs? – Mother Jones,"This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.



A blind cave-dwelling weevil an ant that protects the caterpillars of one of Australia’s rarest butterflies and the first millipede to actually have more than 1000 legs were among 139 new species described by scientists at CSIRO in the past year.

Other discoveries formally named and described in scientific journals include 131 insects and other invertebrates four fish three plants and a frog.

One of the invertebrates—a parasitic flatworm now known as Enenterum petrae—was discovered inside a specimen of a fish collected from Lizard Island on the Great Barrier reef and named in honor of CSIRO scientist Daniel Huston’s new daughter Petra.

Dr. David Yeates an insect expert at CSIRO said formally describing species in scientific journals was a critical part of protecting biodiversity.

Like taking children to a buffet the ants carry the caterpillars…to fresh bull-oak leaves both protecting them and letting them feed.

A newly named ant—Anonychomyrma inclinata—has a remarkable relationship with one of Australia’s rarest and most striking butterflies the Bulloak jewel. Like taking children to a buffet the ants carry the caterpillars in their jaws from their daytime hideaway underneath bark to fresh bull-oak leaves both protecting them and letting them feed.

Yeates said ants would often eat caterpillars but this new species works more like a babysitter. For the ant’s efforts Yeates said the caterpillars release a sugary substance “like ant opium” that the ants feed on. “It’s a neat little relationship. [The caterpillar’s gland] appears to have evolved just to feed and appease the ants” said Yeates.

About 100 of the new species the CSIRO scientists helped to describe are Australian. Most of the scientific papers involved collaborations between CSIRO and other organizations and institutions. They include the first millipede to actually have more than 1000 legs found 60 meters underground in a mining area in Western Australia; a new mountain frog; and four new marine fish.

Among the insects was a new genus of beetle undarobius that has two species that are the first weevils found in Australia to have evolved to live in caves. The species were discovered in lava caves at Undara Volcanic national park in north-eastern Queensland. Yeates said the weevils did not have eyes—a common evolutionary trait for cave dwelling organisms—but were likely a relic of their ancient rainforest cousins.

CSIRO experts say only about a quarter of Australia’s flora and fauna have been formally recorded but the process was vital in understanding and protecting the country’s vast ecosystems.

John Pogonoski a CSIRO fish scientist helped name four new species of marine fish including three brightly colored anthias rarely seen because they live deeper than divers usually go. Pogonoski said the new silverspot weedfish heteroclinus argyrospilos lives as deep as 100 meters below the surface and was described from only two known specimens collected by a CSIRO research vessel between 2000 and 2005.

“Working together with our research community to name species is incredibly important—it is the first step in Australia understanding and managing its biodiversity” Yeates said. “As a country we are still in the very exciting phase of species discovery.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGJpYmxlLmNvbS9jb21tdW5pdHkvd2FsZXMtY291cGxlLXNpbGVuY2Utb2YtdGhlLWxhbWJzLW1vdGgtMjAyMjA4MTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Couple stunned after finding Silence of the Lambs caterpillar in their garden,"A couple were shocked to discover several super rare death’s-head hawkmoth caterpillars – best known for their appearance in Silence of the Lambs – in their garden in Wales.

Ian and Sharon Williams found a number of the caterpillars ‘destroying’ some shrubs in their garden and shared snaps on social media to try and find out what they were.

Ian was quickly flooded with responses from people who were able to shed some light on exactly what the beasts were.

Advert

In the Silence of the Lambs the moths – which often display a skull-shape on their backs – are used by serial killer Buffalo Bill as his calling card.

Ian told the BBC it was his wife who first spotted the caterpillars in their garden in Brynmenyn Bridgend. He said: ""I was in the kitchen and I heard a scream my wife was actually cutting this bush in our garden back.

""That's when we discovered it it was lucky it didn't get cut in half.”

Advert

Ian admitted that he didn’t know very much about moths and caterpillars but now jokes he’s a bit of an expert after a large response to his photos on social media.

In a post on Twitter he asked: “What’s this bad boy mate? Got 3 of them destroying a bush in our garden in leafy Brynmenyn Bridgend.”

He joked: ""I've been party to all these replies now so I am now the leading authority on this moth.”

And it actually turns out that it’s a bit of a rare find with Dr Sarah Christofides from Cardiff University's school of biosciences telling the BBC she would be ‘really really excited’ and ‘really pleased’ if she happened to find one in her own garden.

She explained: ""Generally hawkmoths are very big moths – and they're not as common as perhaps some of the smaller ones you get.

Advert

""If you look at an adult death's-head hawkmoth you'd see what an incredibly beautiful animal it is.""

So beautiful in fact that one of them even made its way onto the poster for the 1991 Oscar-winning movie.

Dr Arthur Morris a research associate at Cardiff University mirrored Dr Christofides sentiments telling the outlet that it was ‘really unusual’ to see one in the UK and that he himself had never managed it.

Ian said he’s since been keeping a close eye on his shrubbery to see if any more of the caterpillars are hanging around but as yet hasn’t seen any.

Dix

For the Record-Courier

The Moebius Nature Center a not-for-profit facility located next to Sunny Lake Park that is dedicated to environmental conservation and the Rotary Club of Aurora are undertaking the planting of hundreds of oak trees in Aurora over the next two years and welcome our support.

The Ashes to Oaks effort is led by Dr. Bill Shaul a physician who was inspired to launch the campaign by the work of nationally renowned conservation biologist Dr. Doug Tallamy from the University of Delaware.

Shaul cites some pretty grim statistics that have inspired the oak tree planting initiative. They include:

The loss of hundreds of millions of ash trees throughout North America due to the Emerald Ash Borer.

An estimated 30-billion birds lost in North America during the past 50 years. Much of the loss scientists say is due to a loss of insects particularly caterpillars.

The loss of nearly 10 million birds within species that depend on insects in their diets. In contrast there has been no change in the numbers of birds that do not depend on caterpillars to feed their young.

According to Shaul a key link has been shown to exist between oak trees and most of our native songbirds. The reason he writes is that oak trees more than any other native plant or tree are the major habitat for hundreds of species of caterpillars. Caterpillars have more nutritional value for birds than almost any other kind of insects.

Nutrients in the leaves of oak trees are consumed by caterpillars and then consumed by songbirds so the oak tree leaves are essential to the health of the birds

Another advantage of oak trees Shaul writes is their ability to trap and remove from the atmosphere more carbon dioxide than any other native tree. Furthermore he writes oak trees can stabilize the soil and improve watersheds.

Shaul and other volunteers at the Moebius Nature Center are planting oak saplings in small groves of three to eight trees to ensure their long-term survival. They have received encouragement and support from Aurora Mayor Ann Womer Benjamin and the Aurora Tree Commission.

Those interested in volunteering in the effort may contact Shaul at theshauls@msn.com. Tax deductible donations for the purchase of trees may be made to the Moebius Nature Center at kim@mymnc.org.

Other ways to support the caterpillar and insect population include:

Avoid the use of outdoor lighting all night long. Yellow LED lights or motion detectors are better alternatives if security is necessary.

Avoid spraying for mosquitos because the spray tends to kill more moths and other insects important to a healthy bird population than it does mosquitos.

The city’s office market witnessed positive signs in the first half. (Photo: tphcm.chinhphu.vn)

– Ho Chi Minh City’s office market witnessed its first positive signs in the first half of this year since being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic for the previous two years experts said.A report from CBRE said that for leasing relocation accounted for more than 50% of total transactions and the remaining transactions were for expansion renewal and new letting at about 27% 12% and 10% respectively.There were no more contractions as there were in 2020 and 2021 the company said.In the first half the company said there was one new Grade B office building CMC Creative Space in District 7. The total net leasable office supply in HCMC was roughly 1.5 million sq.m.The average vacancy rate of Grade A decreased by 1.6 percentage point quarter-on-quarter and 2.1 percentage point year-on-year to 10.1% mainly due to major absorption in District 7. Meanwhile the average vacancy rate of Grade B remained at 9.7% almost the same as last year.Information technology (IT) and service industries accounted for more than 50% of total transacted areas. IT firms with growing business and investment continue to expand their leasing and quickly finalize their decisions within three to six months.With the recovery of manufacturing after the pandemic sourcing companies are coming back to Vietnam and actively seeking office space making up a rising percentage of new leases. All these brands are from the US including outdoor and sports equipment CBRE said.Cushman and Wakefield confirmed that despite many changes in behaviour and habits of office users in the past two years Vietnam’s office market including HCM City in the first half of 2022 showed recovery and growth.Forecasts for demand continue to look positive largely due to growth in office-based employment weaker adoption of flexible working practices and the enduring vital role of offices. The future workplace will be an ecosystem that offers many options for employees both in terms of workspace types working time and amenities around the office according to the real estate service firm.The second quarter report from the company saw office rental price remain relatively stable even at final units in prime location buildings. Grade A and Grade B average rents were 59.9 USD per sq.m per month and 34 USD per sq.m per month up 1.9% year-on-year and 1.2% year-on-year respectively.Trang Bui general manager of Cushman and Wakefield commented: “Demand for Grade A and B office rose due to the growing number of newly registered businesses and expansion needs from foreign investors. Most companies expect a quality space equipped with expansive view of the city centre one that can enhance the brand attract clients and talents alike. However the past five years has seen no new supply of Grade A office space and the number of projects to be launched in the next two years is scarce: The Hallmark [handover expected at end of this year) The Sun Tower [handover expected in 2023]. The supply shortage situation is also in mid-range segment as there are only a few buildings completed and ready to be leased this quarter: CMC Creative Space [District 7] Pearl 5 [District 3].”The report from CBRE said that HCM City expected to welcome nearly 30000 sq.m of net leasable area (NLA) in the second half of 2022 from three Grade B buildings and two Grade A building. Along the Sai Gon River previously delayed buildings due to COVID had resumed construction and a well-planned and magnificent skyline for this area was shaping up.

SOPA Images/Contributor

The head of Instagram Adam Mosseri is relocating to London.

The company is reportedly looking to hire more staff for Instagram's product team in the UK capital.

Meta employees are generally paid less in London than in Instagram's base in San Francisco.

The head of Instagram Adam Mosseri is relocating to London. The move is due to ""the global nature"" of Mosseri's role a spokesperson from Instagram's parent company Meta told Insider.

London is the company's largest engineering hub outside the US and has a dedicated Instagram product team the spokesperson added.

Mosseri will reportedly be seeking to hire more staff in the UK offices according to The Guardian. Any staff hired in the UK capital can expect to earn less than their counterparts in San Francisco however.

The reasons for this pay disparity include a higher cost of living paired with an inflated level of demand for tech specialists in the US city.

Across Meta San Francisco-based workers make more money than employees in London.

Meta's average product manager in London earns $146605 base salary a year according to data from the employee review site Glassdoor. Product designers at the company make an average salary of $115150 a year according to the same data.

In San Francisco three product managers hired by Meta in the last year were paid between $180000 to $210000. While a product designer hired in 2022 was paid a base salary of $185792 according to publically disclosed foreign labor data.

This salary disparity is not unusual said Chris Abbass who heads up Talentful a recruitment service for tech companies that operates in San Francisco and London.

""Inflation and demand for tech specialists are pushing up salaries across all geographies but there is still a huge difference between London and San Francisco"" he said.

Despite Meta being one of the highest-paying tech companies around the world hiring in London tends to be cheaper than doing so at the company's headquarters in San Francisco.

He added: ""The sheer volume of high-growth tech companies in San Francisco creates massive demand for highly skilled workers which pushes up salaries faster than in other geographies.""

The cost of living is also a factor in the pay disparity. San Francisco is ranked the 14th most expensive city in the world by Numbeo a site that provides a crowdsourced summary of the cost of living across major cities. London is listed as the 40th most expensive city on its cost of living index.







Even locals claim you need $1.7 million to be ""financially comfortable"" in San Francisco and $5.1 million to be considered wealthy by Bay Area standards according to an Insider report which cited the data from a Charles Schwab survey earlier this year.

""Californians' costs of living are often higher — they can expect to drive more pay more for food and rent pay private medical bills and so on which puts more pressure on businesses to raise salaries"" Abbass said. ""The infrastructure and the social support are also a lot weaker in America.""

The average monthly cost of living for one person in San Francisco is $1351.37 excluding rent costs according to Numbeo. Meanwhile a single person in London can get by on an average of $1100 per month before rent according to data.

London residents also benefit from a stronger social support system than the US with free healthcare and better transport infrastructure than San Francisco.

But even with those socio-economic differences accounted for Abbass said there is still a significant gap between London and San Francisco salaries for skilled tech roles mainly due to the sheer number of high-growth tech companies in the US city.

London may be home to an exciting and fast-growing tech scene particularly for fintech companies but San Francisco has historically been the leading hub for major tech companies such as Meta. Salaries for skilled tech workers in the city have been inflated by this demand for years.",,,,,,,,,,,,

What happens when you push a small snowball down a hill… And what does this have to do with growing wealthy?

When you push a small snowball down a hill it continuously picks up snow. When it reaches the bottom of the hill it is a giant snow boulder.



Source: Calvin & Hobbes

The snowball compounds during its travel down the hill. The bigger it gets the more snow it packs on with each revolution. The snowball effect is a metaphor for compounding. It explains how small actions carried out over time can lead to big results.

In the same way investing in high-quality dividend growth stocks can generate large amounts of dividend income over long periods of time. Investors looking for the best dividend growth stocks should consider the Dividend Aristocrats a group of 65 stocks in the S&P 500 with 25+ consecutive years of dividend growth.

The Power of The Snowball Effect

Before we discuss how to harness the power of the snowball effect we must understand the power of compounding.

The snowball metaphor visually shows the power of compounding.

“The most powerful force in the world is compound interest”

– Attributed to Albert Einstein

Here’s the power of compound interest:

Imagine you invested $1 that compounded at 1% a day. In 5 years your $1 would grow to over $77 million. You would be the richest person in the world by year 7.

Keep in mind that compounding is not a get rich quick scheme. It takes time – and lots of it. There are no investments that compound at 1% a day in the real world.

The stock market has compounded wealth (adjusting for inflation) at ~7.1% a year over the long run. At this rate an investment in the stock market has historically doubled every 10.1 years.

It takes more time to compound wealth in the real world – but that doesn’t make the principles of compounding any less powerful.

Take Warren Buffett as an example. Warren Buffett is worth over $100 billion. Warren Buffett’s wealth comes from the tremendous benefits of the snowball effect through time.

Warren Buffett compounded his wealth through a specific type of investment.

Specifically Buffett invests in:

Shareholder-friendly businesses With strong competitive advantages Trading at fair or better prices

“All there is to investing is picking good stocks at good times and staying with them as long as they remain good companies.”

– Warren Buffett

The next section of this article discusses how to harness the power of the snowball effect by investing in the same type of businesses Warren Buffett does.

How You Can Harness The Snowball Effect

You can harness the power of the snowball effect by investing in the same type of businesses that have made Warren Buffett so wealthy over time.

Looking at Berkshare Hathaway’s portfolio its top 5 stocks (as of its most recent 13F filing) make up 74.7% of the portfolio:

42.09% is invested in Apple Inc. (AAPL)

11.26% is invested in Bank of America (BAC)

7.67% is invested in American Express (AXP)

7.01% is invested in Chevron Corporation (CVX)

6.71% is invested in Cola-Cola (KO)

These 5 Warren Buffett stocks represent a compounding machine. Do you know what’s interesting about these 5 business?

All 5 are well-established businesses that pay dividends.

Apple has a 0.7% dividend yield

Bank of America has a 2.7% dividend yield

American Express has a 1.4% dividend yield

Chevron has a 3.4% dividend yield

Coca-Cola has a 3.0% dividend yield

The average dividend yield of Berkshire Hathaway’s top 5 stocks is 2.2%. Warren Buffett holds a concentrated portfolio of businesses with above-average dividend yields and long histories of dividend payments to shareholders.

Investing in this type of business is the surest way to benefit from the snowball effect.

The good news is you don’t even have to search for these businesses. There is a list of 44 businesses with 50+ years of consecutive dividend increasescalled the Dividend Kings list.

Nothing says long-term success like 50 or more years of paying rising dividends in a row.

Coca-Cola (one of Buffett’s biggest investments) is a Dividend King. There are many other well-known stocks in the Dividend Kings list including:

Procter & Gamble (PG)

3M (MMM)

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

You may read this and think: “these businesses may have a history of success but isn’t their run over”?

Investors have wasted tremendous sums of money chasing ‘the new hot stock’. You cannot benefit from the snowball effect by investing in businesses that are unproven. Steady dependable results lead to wealth multiplication.

What would happen if you had invested in some of the most well-known Dividend Kings in 1990?

The 7 example businesses below all had 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases by the end of 1990. They were well-known blue-chip stocks in 1990.

It didn’t take a genius to buy and hold them…

But the results speak for themselves. Five examples of the snowball effect in action are below. All examples assume dividends were reinvested.



Example #1: The Coca-Cola Company (KO)

Coca-Cola compounded investor wealth at over 14% a year (including dividends) over the last 30 years. Coca-Cola was the largest soda brand in the United States in 1990… And had a 98 year operating history at the time. It was not a start-up.

Coca-Cola stock ended 1991 at a share price of $4.94 per share adjusted for splits and reinvested dividends. The stock closed at $58.76 per share on December 31st 2021. That means the stock generated annualized returns of 8.6% per year over the 30-year period from 1991-2021.



Example #2: Lowe’s Companies (LOW)

Lowe’s is the second-largest home improvement store in the United States behind only The Home Depot (HD). In 1991 Lowe’s was one of the largest home improvement stores in the United States. It had a dividend history of over 25 consecutive years of increases even then.

Investors in Lowe’s 30 years ago have done very well…

Lowe’s ended 2021 trading at an adjusted price of $256.59. With an adjusted price of $0.76 to end 1991 (accounting for stock splits and reinvested dividends) Lowe’s stock delivered compound annual returns of 21% per year over the past 30 years.

This means a $1000 investment 30 years ago would be worth just over $336000 to begin 2022.

Example #3: Procter & Gamble (PG)

Procter & Gamble was just as well-known in 1990 as it is today. The company has an iconic brand portfolio with names like Tide Bounty Gillette and Charmin (among many others).

The company was founded in 1837. In 1990 Procter & Gamble had been around for 153 years… Not exactly a young company.

Still long-term investors in Procter & Gamble have done well. The stock has produced 30-year annualized total returns of 11.9% a year.

Example #4: Colgate-Palmolive (CL)

Colgate-Palmolive traces its history back to 1806. Both the Colgate and Palmolive brands are easily recognized.

In addition to these brands Colgate-Palmolive owns the Speed Stick Soft Soap and Hill’s brands (among many others).

Colgate-Palmolive has paid dividends since 1893. The company has paid increasing dividends for over 50 consecutive years. In 1991 the company had a streak of 28 consecutive dividend increases.

How did 1991 investors do?

Colgate-Palmolive generated a compound annual returns of 11.5% during this 30-year period.

Example #5: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Johnson & Johnson is currently the largest health care corporation in the world. The company is one of the most stable businesses in the world as well.

This stability is reflected in Johnson & Johnson’s long history of dividend payments to shareholders. This ‘slow and steady’ business has been a boon for shareholders over the long-run.

The company generated compound returns of 11.2% a year for shareholders during this time period.

The company’s low stock price volatility only adds to its appeal. Investors have historically generated excellent returns with Johnson & Johnson stock without as many gut-wrenching ups and downs as compared to other stocks.

Snowball-Effect Stocks For The Next 25 Years

All 5 examples above trounced the market despite being well established businesses with long dividend histories.

But…

What stocks will be the next snowball effect compounders?

There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Anyone holding the serial compounders above should continue to do so.

For those looking to enter into new positions in snowball effect stocks should look for the following:

Above average dividend yield Below average price-to-earnings ratio Long dividend history

The biggest constraint of the 3 is the long dividend history. We will start by selecting only from the Dividend Aristocrats List.

To be a Dividend Aristocrat a stock must have 25+ years of consecutive dividend payments and be in the S&P 500. There are currently 65 stocks that match this criteria.

Out of the 65 Dividend Aristocrats we will screen for:

A dividend yield above the S&P 500’s 1.7% yield A price-to-earnings below the S&P 500’s ratio of 18.8

We will then sort these by expected total return. Total return is the expected earnings-per-share growth rate plus the current dividend yield as well as the net impact of any positive or negative changes in the price-to-earnings multiple.

The 10 highest expected total return Dividend Aristocrats with above market dividend yields and below market price-to-earnings ratios are listed below:

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK): Expected return of 19.9%

V.F. Corp (VFC): Expected return of 17.1%

3M Company (MMM): Expected return of 17.0%

Lowe’s Companies (LOW): Expected return of 15.3%

T. Rowe Price Group (TROW): Expected return of 14.8%

Target Corporation (TGT): Expected return of 14.7%

Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): Expected return of 14.5%

Pentair plc (PNR): Expected return of 14.3%

Franklin Resources (BEN): Expected return of 14.2%

Leggett & Platt (LEG): Expected return of 12.2%

The 10 stocks listed above best match the criteria to best take advantage of the snowball effect.

‘Snowball stocks’ have strong and durable competitive advantages. Evidence of their competitive advantages is seen by their long operating history and consistent dividend increases.

Long-term investing in great businesses with shareholder-friendly managements at fair or better prices will very likely produce compound wealth gains over time.

Remember the snowball effect when choosing your investments.

The U.S. energy giant extended its rights over two oil blocks at a ceremony on Friday in Abuja. It also renewed production-sharing contracts with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited(NNPC).

“We are pleased to announce the renewals of our OMLs 133 (Erha) and 138 (Usan) deepwater leases for a further 20–year period. This includes extensions of Production Sharing Contracts with our partner NNPC Limited

The permits for the so-called Oil Mining Leases 133 and 138 were due to expire in 2026 and 2027 but were renewed early under sweeping legislation passed last year known as the Petroleum Industry Act. The licenses contain deep-water fields from which the Nigerian government is eager to extract more oil and gas.

“These extensions enable us and our partners to unlock the potential value in these OMLs and to bring forward additional investment” ExxonMobil said.

Three other deep-water leases were renewed at the same ceremony in “a major step” toward boosting production the NNPC said on its Twitter account.

Nigeria’s oil production output has been declining consistently over the past 18 months with the government blaming rampant theft from the onshore pipelines that crisscross the Niger Delta.

Other companies with interests in the five extended licenses and production-sharing contracts include Chevron Corp. Equinor ASA Total Energies SE Shell Plc and Cnooc Ltd.",,,,,,

Construction is nearing completion on the St. Charbel Maronite Church in Doha Qatar with plans to open its doors to worshippers in 2025 coinciding with the Catholic Church’s Jubilee Year according to Father Charbel Mhanna from Qatar’s Maronite parish.

In an interview with ACI Mena CNA’s Arabic-language news partner Mhanna explained that with a capacity of about 3000 people St. Charbel will be the country’s largest church open to all Catholics. Once completed it will be Qatar’s second Catholic church joining the existing Church of Our Lady of the Rosary.

While precise statistics on the Christian population in Qatar are lacking Mhanna estimates there are close to 1 million Christians there of which about 70% are Catholic. Approximately 12000 belong to the Maronite rite which is in full communion with the pope.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvbWF5L3NvdXRoZXJuLWJhcHRpc3QtY2h1cmNoLWRlY2xpbmUtc2JjLWFubnVhbC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvZmlsZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SBC Membership Falls to 47-Year Low But Church Involvement Is Up | News & Reporting,"Despite years of record-setting declines shrinking the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) to its lowest membership in nearly half a century Southern Baptists have begun to see some signs of life within their 46906 churches.

Worship attendance small group attendance and baptisms were up last year in the SBC’s annual statistical report released Tuesday while membership fell below 13 million.

2023 marks 17 straight years of decline for the country’s biggest Protestant denomination. It’s down 3.3 million from its peak with the steepest drops coming during the pandemic. The SBC lost 1.3 million members between 2020 and 2022 alone.

Beyond COVID-19 disruptions Southern Baptists have recently confronted some contentious issues within their convention responding to sexual abuse and clamping down on female preachers which have led some congregations to leave the SBC (including prominent megachurch Saddleback Church).

But statistics indicate that church departures aren’t a significant driver of membership decline; the SBC was down 292 churches last year just 0.63 percent of its total.

In 2023 membership fell by 241000 its smallest decrease since 2018. Yet attendance at SBC churches increased 6.5 percent reaching above 4 million a week for the first time since the pandemic.

Attendance at small groups and Bible studies ticked up 4 percent to 2.4 million.

With fewer Americans than ever attending church and religious disaffiliation on the rise leaders see even small increases in engagement and discipleship as worth celebrating.

It’s the first time in over a decade that SBC worship attendance has grown two years in a row though it still lags behind pre-pandemic numbers. Back in 2019 SBC churches saw over 5 million show up each Sunday.

“Outreach and discipleship are difficult today. They require time and commitment when our culture offers numerous distractions and alternatives. The pandemic was discouraging as fewer people engaged in these activities” said Scott McConnell executive director of Lifeway Research which releases the annual report.

“But as people have re-engaged and new people are participating there is much to celebrate in Southern Baptist churches today while we invite more to join.”

Baptisms the key metric for Southern Baptists also grew for the second year in a row.

“God has been stirring the waters and an upswing in baptisms has solidly begun” wrote SBC president Bart Barber a pastor in Texas.

“Not only have we experienced a second year of increased baptisms but we have also witnessed a year-over-year gain—25.94 percent more baptisms than in 2022—that leaves no room for doubt about what God is doing among our churches.”

Kevin Ezell president of the North American Mission Board said the baptism trend is widespread across regions. Out of 41 state conventions 35 reported more baptisms in 2023 than 2022.

“Pastors are the difference makers here” he said in a statement. “Despite all the distractions and challenges out there they are keeping the focus on evangelism and encouraging new believers to follow up with baptism.”

The report’s release falls about a month before the SBC’s annual meeting which gathers over 10000 messengers in Indianapolis in June. They are slated to address new mechanisms for overseeing abuse reform and reporting as well as clarifications to cooperation agreements and guidance around women in ministry.

The SBC’s current membership of 12982090 is the lowest since 1976. The membership size peaked at 16.3 million in 2006.

One bright spot leaders say is the generosity of members and churches who spent nearly $800 million on missions last year up 9 percent.

“We are sharing the gospel with more people gathering for worship and Bible study in increasing numbers giving billions to support churches serving communities across our country and sending millions to support mission enterprises around the world” said Jeff Iorg the SBC Executive Committee president-elect.

“Southern Baptists are not a perfect people” he added. “But we are a movement making a positive difference in our world and our most recent statistical report underscores this reality and motivates us to press forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvY2xpbnRvbi1jaHVyY2gtaG9zdC1jb21tdW5pdHktYmFieS0xODU4NTYwMTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clinton church to host community baby shower resource fair Saturday,"CLINTON Md.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty."

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Sutradara Fajar Bustomi mengatakan bahwa “12 Cerita Glen Anggara” bukan sekadar film yang bercerita tentang cinta remaja melainkan juga film yang penuh makna dan penuh sensasi rasa yang ingin ditawarkan kepada penonton bioskop.“Lagi-lagi film saya bertemakan remaja tapi kali ini bukan hanya cinta-cintaan saja tapi penuh makna. Kalau sebelumnya banyak 'hahahihi' (komedi) saja tapi yang berikutnya ini lebih dalam. Mungkin kita akan tertawa bareng mungkin akan merenung bareng dan yang lebih sensitif akan menangis bareng” kata Fajar saat gala premiere film tersebut di Grand Indonesia Jumat (12/8) malam.Menurutnya cerita dalam “12 Cerita Glen Anggara” merangkum segala spektrum emosi. Ia berharap penonton bisa ikut merasakan kebahagiaan kesedihan hingga keharuan ketika menonton bersama keluarga teman atau kekasih.“Ini yang ingin saya tawarkan ke penonton film Indonesia. Kadang kita punya uang (untuk) mencari waktu liburan ke bioskop apa yang ingin kita dapatkan? Itu maksudnya. Tertawa bersama teman-teman keluarga pacar haru bersama nangis bersama dan merenungi apa yang ada di layar” katanya.Ditulis oleh Alim Sudio “12 Cerita Glen Anggara” didasarkan pada novel berjudul sama karya Luluk HF yang menjadi sempalan (spin off) film “Mariposa” (2020). Film ini merupakan karya kedua produksi bersama antara Falcon Pictures dan Kharisma Starvision Plus setelah “Mariposa”.Film ini bercerita tentang Glen Anggara (diperankan oleh Junior Roberts) yang berusaha mewujudkan daftar 12 keinginan Shena (diperankan Prilly Latuconsina) salah satunya mewujudkan keinginan untuk menjadi pacar gadis itu. Mulanya Glen tidak memahami hingga pada akhirnya ia menyadari makna di balik keinginan Shena.Senada dengan Fajar Alim juga mengatakan bahwa film ini menyoroti bagaimana perjalanan karakter Glen untuk menemukan makna hidupnya justru saat dia berusaha memenuhi semua keinginan Shena. Ia memandang “12 Cerita Glen Anggara” sebagai suatu karya yang berbicara tentang harapan.Ia berharap film tersebut dapat memberikan makna bagi penonton terutama bagi yang ditinggalkan oleh orang-orang yang disayangi bahwa masih ada harapan untuk terus melanjutkan hidup dan mewujudkan impian dari orang-orang yang meninggalkan.“Ini adalah film tentang harapan bahwa kita yang masih hidup ketika kita melakukan sesuatu untuk orang lain. Pada akhirnya itu akan memberikan kebaikan juga untuk kita kita akan menemukan makna dalam hidup. Itu kenapa (judulnya) jadi ‘12 Cerita Glen Anggara’ (bukan ‘12 Keinginan Shena’)” kata Alim.Film “12 Cerita Glen Anggara” segera tayang secara serentak di bioskop tanah air mulai 18 Agustus. Film ini juga direncanakan akan diputar di Malaysia sekitar tiga minggu setelah penayangan perdananya di Indonesia.

New Delhi: Networking giant Cisco has admitted a cyber-security breach via the “successful compromise” of an employee’s personal Google account saying that no data was compromised.

The attacker conducted a series of sophisticated voice phishing attacks under the guise of various trusted organisations attempting to convince the victim to accept multi-factor authentication (MFA) push notifications initiated by the attacker the company’s own Cisco Talos threat research arm revealed in a blog post.

The incident occurred in May and since then the company had been working to remediate the attack.

“During the investigation it was determined that a Cisco employee’s credentials were compromised after an attacker gained control of a personal Google account where credentials saved in the victim’s browser were being synchronised” wrote Cisco Talos.

The company said it has not identified any evidence suggesting that the attacker gained access to critical internal systems such as those related to product development code signing etc.

“The threat actor was successfully removed from the environment and displayed persistence repeatedly attempting to regain access in the weeks following the attack; however these attempts were unsuccessful” said Cisco.

According to the company the attack was conducted by an adversary that has been previously identified as an initial access broker (IAB) with ties to the UNC2447 cybercrime gang Lapsus$ threat actor group and Yanluowang ransomware operators.

Lapsus$ is a threat actor group that is reported to have been responsible for several previous notable breaches of corporate environments.

Cisco said it implemented a company-wide password reset immediately upon learning of the incident.

The company did not observe ransomware deployment in this attack.

In many cases threat actors have been observed targeting the backup infrastructure in an attempt to further remove an organisation’s ability to recover following an attack.

“Ensuring that backups are offline and periodically tested can help mitigate this risk and ensure an organisation’s ability to effectively recover following an attack” said the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ndWxmLXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS83MjI2NDgvb29yZWRvby1jaXNjby1leHBsb3JlLW5ldy10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMtdG8tZW5oYW5jZS1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLWVuc3VyZS1kaWdpdGFsLWluY2x1c2lvbtIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ndWxmLXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS83MjI2NDgvb29yZWRvby1jaXNjby1leHBsb3JlLW5ldy10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMtdG8tZW5oYW5jZS1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLWVuc3VyZS1kaWdpdGFsLWluY2x1c2lvbi9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ooredoo Cisco explore new technologies to enhance customer experience ensure digital inclusion | Gulf Times,"

He leaves his wife Lucille (Lu) List Morris five of their six children; 12 of their 13 grandchildren and one great-grandson: Tom and his wife Marion and their children Mack (Adele Hayward) and Dillon; Hans and his wife Kate and their daughter Lucy; Fritz and his wife Heather and his children Jack Shay and Siobhan; Monika and her husband Marwan Kreidie and their children Ellie Franz and Noor; and Ted and his wife Susan and their children Miles Charlie and Isabel. He was predeceased by his daughter Alicia of New York City and his grandson Mac (son of Hans and Kate) of Lee Mass. Mac’s wife Jenny of Lee Mass. and their son Billy also survive him as does his sister Tricia Morris (Duffy Herman) of Maui Hi.

Jack had been active in public relations as a consultant and corporate executive for more than 40 years retiring from Citigroup Inc. as its corporate spokesman in 2000 and becoming a consultant until 2007. In his last years with Citigroup he was liaison with the New York Philharmonic tours to Europe (2000) and Latin America (2001). His consulting included assignments for the global law firm of Shearman & Sterling and the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in his career he had been with CPC International the firm of Rubenstein Wolfson & Co. as a partner and J.P. Morgan and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. Earlier he had been a journalist during U.S. Army service and later with the Associated Press in Connecticut The Courier News a daily newspaper then in Plainfield NJ and Medical Economics magazine.

He has been active in a number of professional organizations heading the Wisemen public affairs group and participating in the Public Relations Society of America as an accredited member chairing its Financial Relations Section and in 1999 being named an emeritus member.

He was born on April 16 1931 in Baltimore MD where he was raised by his German immigrant grandparents while his mother (Joan Jurish Morris) was working in New York. He was eventually adopted by his stepfather Vincent E. Morris and moved to White Plains NY as a teenager. He graduated from White Plains High School and from Dartmouth College after service in U.S. Army in the Occupation of Germany 1952-53. He was an instructor in Dartmouth’s Great Issues course in 1956-57 the first year of his marriage to Lu a Music major at Manhattanville College who became secretary to the Music Department.

Jack was given to saying: “I was just a poor boy from Baltimore who got lucky in life and in love as Lu’s husband with our six children and 13 grandchildren and reveling in their love.” He had Lu read Heathen Days H.L. Mencken’s autobiography before they were married so that she could better understand his Baltimore upbringing.

Jack and Lu came to Old Greenwich in 1985 having lived previously for 22 years in New Rochelle NY. They have been active in the community including as members of St. Catherine of Siena Church and Riverside Yacht Club. Among his community activities he has been on the board of Greenwich United Way a member of the Commission on Aging of the Town of Greenwich and chairman of the Landmark Recognition program of the Greenwich Historical Society. On March 1 2019 they moved to Edgehill a senior independent living and continuing care community in Stamford. Shortly before his death he was elected president of Edgehill’s residents’ council.

In lieu of flowers please be generous to a cause that is important to you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvYW5zaHUtamFpbi1kaWVk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anshu Jain: The bank CEO who turned his phone off on holiday,"Anshu Jain the former CEO of Deutsche Bank who has died of cancer aged just 59 had plenty of reasons to be well-liked.

Under his leadership Deutsche didn't just pay well it paid extravagantly. Jain himself reportedly earned up to $30m a year in the peak years of the late 1990s and early 2000s; Deutsche Bank traders routinely earned $10m-$20m a year. Some earned even more: Christian Bittar a 36 year-old French rates trader who was one of Jain's favourites earned $140m for a single year shortly before the financial crisis (and before he was subsequently jailed for manipulating euribor). Under Jain Deutsche's traders were paid and praised; in 2007 he flew the Rolling Stones in to play for them at a concert in Barcelona.

But it's not for his generosity that Jain is being lauded today: it's for his character. Despite being one of the best paid bankers of a generation Jain is celebrated as a humble intellectual aesthete - who also really really wanted to win.

James Davies the current head of Deutsche's investment bank for the Americas says he first met Anshu playing cricket where Jain was knocked to the ground by a ""first ball bouncer"" only to stand up and face the next ball. ""The qualities he showed on the pitch - leadership courage loyalty and a fierce desire to win were the hallmarks of his attitude on the trading floor"" says Davies.

Garth Ritchie the former head of Deutsche's investment bank says Jain will be remembered for his ""intellect & competitive nature"" and that he's grateful for all the ""teaching the coaching"" and the ""gimme putts"" that Jain gave him.

Although Jain liked earning money as a marker of a success he didn't fit the stereotype of the lavish-spending banker. He lived in a ""comparatively modest"" house in West London while he was at DB and was born into the ascetic Jain religion. He didn't eat meat or animal products. He loved wildlife and wildlife photography. His father seems to have been similar: Anshu reportedly bought his father a BMW and paid a driver but his father didn't use them and bought himself a Tata Nano instead.

While Jain could be intensely competitive (and often set-up people competing for the same role at Deutsche Bank) friends of Anshu testify to his kindness humanity and generosity. One says he helped his wife when she fell ill in 2018 and shared all the research and contacts he'd made during his own struggle with cancer.

Jain left Deutsche Bank in 2015 and became president of Cantor Fitzgerald in 2017 the same year he was diagnosed with cancer. Despite his illness he continued appearing at public events speaking at the World Economic Forum in 2020. When his cancer was diagnosed in January 2017 he was given a year to live but his family said he outlasted this “through a combination of exhaustive personal research tactical skill amazing caregivers and sheer force of will.”

Yet Jain knew how to relax too. Andrew Kent the former European head of equity index volatility trading says that Anshu told him he always turned his phone off when he was on holiday on safari so that he could enjoy time with his family.

Anshu is survived by his wife and two children Aranya and Arjun. Arjun works in venture capital after starting his career in JPMorgan. Aranya works in publishing after a year in cross asset sales at Goldman Sachs.

No specific dates for the investments were given and the Saudi firm didn’t respond to questions about whether it still owned them. The value of all those depositary receipts dropped rapidly after the war began when trading in Moscow was halted and western sanctions were imposed on Russia.

Alwaleed whose grandfather was the founder of modern Saudi Arabia is one of the country’s richest men and most high profile international investors. More recently he has been eclipsed by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund chaired by his cousin Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman which acquired a 16.9% stake in Kingdom Holding Co. in May.

Prince Alwaleed was also detained at the Saudi capital’s Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2017 along with other princes and government officials as part of what the state called an anti-corruption probe. No formal charges were ever presented and he was released after 83 days having reached an undisclosed “confirmed understanding” with the government.

Kingdom Holding invested 1.37 billion riyals ($365 million) in Gazprom’s American depositary receipts in February the biggest stake of those disclosed so far this year. It also invested 196 million riyals in Rosneft’s global depositary receipts the same month and 410 million riyals in Lukoil’s American depositary receipts between February and March.

Other investments

Kingdom Holding invested $3.4 billion in global equities and depositary receipts since 2020 based on the filing a rare bit of disclosure by the company. The largest stake was an investment valued at 2.5 billion riyals in Spain’s Telefonica SA between April to August 2020.

It also disclosed stakes in Uber Technologies Inc. TotalEnergies SE Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and BHP Group Ltd. acquired mostly in 2020 and 2021. The most recent deal it disclosed was a 178 million riyal stake in Hercules Capital Inc. made in June. The venture capital firm’s shares have risen 17% since the start of July.

Prince Alwaleed 67 became one of the highest profile Saudi investors after taking stakes in companies such as Citigroup Inc. and Apple Inc. He’s supported Prince Mohammed’s modernization efforts including giving women the right to drive.

More recently he’s announced the sale of a stake in his Rotana Music label to Warner Music Group Corp. and he raised $2.2 billion by selling part of his stake in the Four Seasons hotel chain to Bill Gates’ Cascade Investment LLC.

Alwaleed is known for long-term investments and is a fan of famed investor Warren Buffett. He once called himself the Oracle of Omaha’s Arabian equivalent.",,,,,,

At the start of Friday’s series opener with the San Diego Padres the image sent the Washington Nationals manager deep into his own memory. Martinez remembered Soto helping lead the Nationals to a title in 2019. He remembered Soto’s huge hits through that World Series run. Going back a bit he might have recalled a 19-year-old Soto not yet a major leaguer impressing with a seasoned plate approach during an exhibition in spring training.

A few months later Soto was promoted into the Nationals’ lineup and stayed there. At least until the club traded him to the Padres along with first baseman Josh Bell on Aug. 2.

“Whenever I think about it yeah it’s really sad” Martinez said this past Sunday in the visiting manager’s office at Citizens Bank Park. “Ever since the trade I’ve just felt grateful that I managed Juan and also bummed he’s not here anymore. You go through your head and say to yourself ‘If this is different … if this is different … if this is different … maybe …’ But we got some great young players back for him. Now all I can do is look at the future.”

Like Martinez many around the organization have been unpacking the deal in the days since. And in conversations with eight of them — most of which happened on the condition of anonymity because the people are not authorized to speak publicly — common perspectives emerged.

There is frustration that the club reached a point at which trading Soto a 23-year-old superstar felt like the best path forward — a product of lapses in player development misses in the draft underperformance among once-reliable players past trades to remain competitive for many years and key injuries including repeated health issues for pitcher Stephen Strasburg through the first three seasons of a seven-year $245 million contract. But once the deal was finalized there was also excitement about landing a six-player package of outfielders Robert Hassell III and James Wood left-handed pitcher MacKenzie Gore shortstop C.J. Abrams right-handed pitcher Jarlin Susana and first baseman/designated hitter Luke Voit.

Many in the front office feel these sentiments can coexist. When Soto didn’t take a 15-year $440 million extension offer in early July a small group of front office members started to look at teams that could even put together a haul for Soto let alone part with one. That list included the Padres Los Angeles Dodgers St. Louis Cardinals Tampa Bay Rays New York Yankees Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays according to multiple people familiar with the process. ESPN reported the Texas Rangers were in initial discussions too.

But it took the Padres and General Manager A.J. Preller to meet the Nationals’ immovable asks. Some teams such as the Yankees didn’t have prospects Washington coveted according to two people with knowledge of the club’s thinking. Other teams such as the Cardinals were not as aggressive as publicly characterized according to three people.

On Aug. 1 Preller acquired all-star reliever Josh Hader from the Milwaukee Brewers and didn’t move any prospects the Nationals wanted. Deep into that night Preller and Mike Rizzo Washington’s general manager went back and forth. Joining Rizzo in the Nationals’ war room were Mike DeBartolo assistant general manager in charge of baseball operations; Mark Scialabba the assistant GM who coordinates in-person scouting of possible acquisitions; Ted Towne the team’s chief financial officer; De Jon Watson director of player development; and James Badas assistant director of baseball operations. Max Ehrman a high-ranking member of the analytics department also joined them at points.

Throughout the weeks-long process Rizzo kept saying he would hold on to Soto if the deal wasn’t right according to multiple people familiar with the situation. Trading him over the winter was another avenue. So was seeing if potential new owners might be able to keep Soto in D.C. for the bulk of his career though multiple people said the club never solicited input from prospective buyers.

By 3 a.m. Eastern time with about 15 hours until the trade deadline the two sides had the framework for a deal. Hassell Wood Gore and Abrams four top prospects were essentially the demand for Soto. As Rizzo later explained Susana was added when Bell joined the Nationals’ package. Voit was one of the three major leaguers Washington would have accepted — along with Wil Myers and Eric Hosmer who would veto going to the Nationals with his no-trade clause. Voit padded the return and helped balance the money for San Diego.

“From the beginning Preller seemed like the GM who was going to make a big move like this” said one person with the Nationals. “But once the Hader deal happened I think there was a sense that they were going all-in and he wasn’t going to let the deadline pass without getting Juan Soto. In that way it was like a perfect storm.”

The next morning Soto received a call from his agent Scott Boras with the news. They had spent much of the past year discussing the Nationals’ offers and Soto’s potential worth on the open market. In the months before the coronavirus pandemic began the team offered extensions worth $110 million and $180 million according to three people with knowledge of the matter. ESPN previously reported those efforts. Then they dangled a 13-year $350 million offer early in the year; a contract with a total value of $415 million in the spring; and the final $440 million offer in July.

According to multiple people with Washington there was hope that at the very least $440 million would kick-start discussions with Soto and his camp. But when that didn’t happen when Boras never countered Rizzo’s willingness to field trade offers intensified.

During the all-star break Boras told the New York Post the offer was not in the “range of consideration.” The average annual value of $29.3 million was well below what Soto and Boras are seeking. That only confirmed the Nationals’ doubts about signing him to a long-term extension before he could reach free agency after the 2024 season. And if they couldn’t they viewed this deadline as a chance to move Soto one of the best to play for the Nationals to restock a thin farm system and potentially accelerate a rebuild that has them angling toward a third consecutive last-place finish.

That and Preller’s aggressiveness were how Soto wound up in the opposite dugout Friday night.

“It was pretty tough to go through it” Soto said of leaving Washington. “But at the end of the day I really understand that it’s a business and you got to do the best for yourself. They just did the best for them. And I’m happy with them whatever no hard feelings or anything like that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9tbGIvcGhpbGxpZXMvb3BpbmlvbnMvY291bGQtcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLXBoaWxsaWVzLXN0ZWFsLWphY29iLWRlZ3JvbS1uZXcteW9yay1tZXRzLW9mZnNlYXNvbi1mcmVlLWFnZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could the Phillies Steal deGrom from the Mets this Offseason?,"The Philadelphia Phillies could make a surprise push for Jacob deGrom this offseason when he opts out of his contract with the New York Mets.

The best pitcher in baseball will be a free agent this offseason.

Two-time Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom plans to opt out of his contract with the New York Mets following the 2022 season. On his current contract he would earn $30.5 million to pitch for the Mets next season. The right-hander seems confident he could command much more on the open market.

If and when he does hit free agency deGrom will have no shortage of suitors. While he has missed much of the past two seasons with injuries he is still the most talented pitcher on the planet. In 200 career starts he has a 2.50 ERA.

Over the past 100 years just two pitchers have started that many games with an ERA of 2.50 or lower: deGrom and Clayton Kershaw.

Although the Mets ace comes with some serious risk his upside is unparalleled. Any contending team with money to spend and a free space in their starting rotation should give deGrom's agent a call.

The Philadelphia Phillies are one such team.

After the season Zach Eflin Kyle Gibson and Noah Syndergaard will all become free agents. The Phillies will need to find two more starting pitchers to slot into the rotation alongside Aaron Nola Zack Wheeler and Ranger Suárez.

Philadelphia will also have significant money to spend this offseason. In addition to Eflin Gibson and Syndergaard the contracts of relievers Corey Knebel Brad Hand Jeurys Familia and David Robertson will all be gone after the season.

Position players Didi Gregorius and Odúbel Herrera will be off the payroll too. Jean Segura could also hit free agency if the team chooses not to pick up his club option for 2023.

With those ten players leaving the Phillies will have approximately $76.5 million in luxury tax payroll coming off the books. That's more than enough to sign deGrom and fill their other holes without going over the second CBT threshold.

So Philadelphia has both the roster space and the payroll flexibility to sign deGrom. What's standing in their way?

For one thing many sources expect Dave Dombrowski will instead use his new budget to go after one of the premiere shortstops on the market. In that scenario the Phillies would slide Bryson Stott over to second base and officially move on from Segura.

A move like that makes a lot of sense. Stott is a much better defensive player at second than he is at short and there is an abundance of shortstop talent available this offseason. Players like Trea Turner Dansby Swanson and Carlos Correa would all be terrific additions to Philadelphia's lineup.

At the same time there remains a solid chance the team decides to stick with Stott at shortstop. He has been improving defensively at the position and his bat is slowly starting to come alive against big league pitching.

If the Phillies are happy with Stott at short Dombrowski would be wise to focus his resources on starting pitching instead. And if he's in the market for starters why not go after the best possible option?

Truth be told there is another major reason Dombrowski might avoid the best pitcher on the market: he has only made 14 starts in the past two years. No one doubts deGrom's abilities but many will be scared off by his injury history. It's a perfectly reasonable cause for concern.

Philadelphia has always been hesitant to award long contracts to pitchers let alone pitchers at high risk for injury. If deGrom is looking for a long-term contract this franchise probably won't be the one to give it to him.

Be that as it may the Phillies might actually be better suited than most teams to weather an injury. They already have two aces in Nola and Wheeler so they would have arms to anchor the rotation even if deGrom goes down.

They also have two top pitching prospects in Mick Abel and Griff McGarry who could be knocking on the big league door by next summer. If deGrom gets hurt midseason it could be the perfect opportunity to give Abel or McGarry a big league cup of coffee.

Furthermore there is the fact that deGrom is so good he does not even need to pitch a full season in order to be a valuable asset to the team. He made just 12 starts in 2021 and still earned a Cy Young vote. He ranked among the top ten NL pitchers in both FanGraphs WAR and Baseball Reference WAR that season.

Simply put deGrom would make Philadelphia a better team. If his injury issues are behind him he could make them one of the best teams in baseball. He's a bit of risk but he's the kind of gamble worth taking.

The Phillies are not going to be the favorites to land deGrom. They already have two of the best starting pitchers in baseball so another ace isn't atop their list of needs. There is also the possibility that ownership wants to get back under the luxury tax for next season and deGrom could be asking for a record-breaking average annual value on his next contract.

This organization is usually cautious when it comes to free agent pitchers and deGrom's injury history will surely give the front office pause. Plus with so many talented arms in the farm system Dombrowski might prefer to spend his budget on position players instead.

Despite all that there is still a chance deGrom is wearing red pinstripes next spring. As the Nick Castellanos signing this past offseason proved Dombrowski is full of surprises and ownership is willing to go over the luxury tax for the right players.

A rotation fronted by deGrom Nola and Wheeler could be the greatest one this team has ever assembled — and that's really saying something. With that rotation Philadelphia would be back in contention for the NL East crown and they would be practically unstoppable in the postseason.

Long story short it's unlikely the Phillies sign deGrom. And it would be a big risk if they did. But it would also be one of the most exciting and impactful free agent signings in franchise history. Sometimes those are the kinds of moves a good baseball team just has to make.

Read more

NEW YORK — If Bryce Harper’s work goes well on Sunday he will take batting practice on the field at Citizens Bank Park on Monday according to interim manager Rob Thomson. Harper hasn’t taken batting practice on the field since he was hit by a Blake Snell pitch on June 25 fracturing his left thumb. He will take some flips and overhand batting practice in the batting cage on Sunday.

Thomson called it a “huge” step for Harper who has been on the injured list since June 26. If Monday’s batting practice goes well the Phillies will simulate velocity for Harper in the batting cage using high-speed pitching machines. If that goes well he’ll start a rehab assignment with one of the Phillies’ advanced-level minor league affiliates.

The Phillies aren’t sure when Harper will be able to rejoin the team but they are optimistic it’ll be sooner rather than later.

“It’s getting there” Thomson said. “He’s making progress. It’s good. And like I said if everything goes well today he’ll be on the field tomorrow taking BP.”

Before he got hurt Harper was the Phillies’ hottest hitter. Over 64 games he batted .318/.385/.599 at the DH spot (Harper was diagnosed with a small tear in his right ulnar collateral ligament in mid-May and has been unable to play right field since then).

Schwarber out of the lineup again

For the third straight day Kyle Schwarber was out of the Phillies starting lineup as he recovers from a mild right calf strain. Schwarber pinch-hit for Matt Vierling on Saturday night and could be available to pinch-hit again on Sunday afternoon. Thomson still doesn’t think that Schwarber will require an injured list stint.

“(He feels) the same as yesterday” Thomson said. “He’ll be available to pinch hit. He’s going to run a little bit more today. I don’t know when he’ll be back to DH role or outfield role yet but at least he can give us one at-bat.”

Could we see Bryson Stott at leadoff? Maybe

Rookie shortstop Bryson Stott only has two games worth of experience batting leadoff but he has made the most of them. Against two of the best pitchers in baseball — Max Scherzer and Jacob deGrom — Stott has gone 4-for-8. He was one of only two Phillies hitters to get a hit off of deGrom on Saturday night.

“The at-bats the defense can’t say enough about him” Thomson said. “He’s really played well. And with not much of a heartbeat. He’s really calm really poised he’s played really well.”

Thomson said they’ll have to have “discussions” about where Stott will hit moving forward but wouldn’t rule out the possibility of it being in the leadoff spot.

“For me it is (a possibility)” Thomson said. “He’s showed that he can do it.”

Schwarber has batted leadoff 79 times this season and likes batting there which will have to be a consideration.

“I think guys should hit where they feel comfortable if that’s the right spot” Thomson said. “If a guy is a nine hole hitter and he says he feels more comfortable in the three spot I’m probably not going to put him there you know what I mean.”

Jimmy Buffett’s “Escape to Margaritaville” the “SpongeBob SquarePants” musical and film adaptations from “Mean Girls” to “Beetlejuice” to “Mrs. Doubtfire” are a long way from “The Sound of Music” and “West Side Story.”

But actor Veronica Stern finds old charm in new musical “Anastasia.”

“I love Golden Age musicals” Stern told the Herald. “I grew up watching them. I watched ‘West Side Story’ a million times and ‘Guys & Dolls.’ A lot of contemporary musicals have you belt really high like in rock ’n’ roll. Those can be really cool but ‘Anastasia’ is very unique because it is a contemporary musical but it has such a Golden Age feel to it.”

Stern makes her Boston debut during the second week of the run of “Anastasia” at the Citizens Bank Opera House from Aug. 17 to 28. Playing the lead role of Anya — an amnesiac orphan looking to uncover her royal roots between fall of the Russian aristocracy and the fanfare of Paris in the ’20s — Stern steps into a dream part (a dream earned after years of hard work).

“‘Anastasia’ is the story of a woman searching for her identity and is full of mystery and wonder adventure and romance” Stern said. “I grew up with princesses and grew up wanting to play one on stage but Anastasia is so unique because she stands by herself in a way that a lot of (film and theater) princesses don’t. It’s important to tell a story like this in 2022.”

Current lead Kyla Stone who will be with the production in its first week in Boston made history as the first Black actor to play Anya in “Anastasia.” As a woman of color Stern says she will bring her own experience to the role when she takes over in the second week and continues on with the tour which will hit two dozen more cities in 2022 alone.

“I don’t think this story is necessarily one of color” Stern said. “Anyone can play Anastasia. It’s the story of a woman trying to find herself and we are all trying to find ourselves to figure out who we are.”

As someone who began her career during a pandemic Stern is thrilled to be on a national tour of this size — “it’s an experience that’s pretty unbelievable” she said. Thankfully she graduated from the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music in 2021 right as the theater industry began opening back up.

Stern is young talented and deserving — Broadway World named her one to watch in 2022. But she knows that a break like this is a thrill at any age.

“I went to school for four years to study to do this but it doesn’t matter if this happens at 23 or 32 or 92 it’s always a really special thing to get to do this” she said.

It also doesn’t hurt to be 23 and love classic MGM musicals like someone who is 92.

Guest columnist

Jim Boyer is a farmer based in Ringsted.

A few months ago President Joe Biden warned food shortages are “going to be real.” He may just be onto something for the first time in a long time. Americans should take note. Already food banks are turning up empty shelves and food prices are out of control. These are both ominous signs.

Here’s the real question: If the Biden administration’s disastrous handling of the still-unsolved baby formula shortage is any indication does he have a plan to mitigate potential food shortages? Logic would dictate that supporting America’s farmers would be the first step. To not do so would be like hearing a thunderstorm is coming and not closing your windows.

It appears Biden has taken the second route. “We’re in a crisis right now” John Boyd Jr. the president of the National Black Farmers Association warned back in May. In June he called out Biden for “promis(ing) me a meeting last year” to discuss inflation with no follow-up.

American farmers are seeing “increased costs across the board” from fertilizer and pesticides to equipment repairs and seasonal labor. Diesel costs are through the roof amid Biden’s war on American energy. Glyphosate — the active ingredient in in one of America’s most widely used weed killers — is up 250% from a year earlier in part because of “supply chain challenges” Biden promised to fix. According to another survey the Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer from April 30% of farmers struggled to get herbicides 27% farm machinery parts 26% fertilizers and 17% insecticides.

All of this could mean less food when crops are harvested in the long-term. And American farmers are getting financially clobbered as a result. A recent study from Texas A&M University found farmer profits will drop by 60% in 2022 in part because of higher input costs.

While financial incentives to farm are being eviscerated the question then follows: Who is supposed to swoop in and pick up the plow? I think I speak for all distraught mothers who haven’t been able to get baby formula: Dear God please not Biden or anyone in his administration.

Already supposed Biden “actions” prove the point. The Biden administration just last month proposed what essentially boils down to more expensive weed control that farmers warn would only hurt them.

Let’s hope the looming food shortage crisis that Biden says will “be real” doesn’t turn out to be the Biden Baby Formula Shortage 2.0. The baby formula shortage has shown that when it comes to matters of hunger — potentially life and death — the Biden administration just can’t seem to muster the urgency required to act swiftly and effectively to protect the American people.

A potential food shortage would be different in that it’s arguably been precipitated by the Biden administration. In 2020 Biden did say after all: “We don’t have a food shortage problem — we have a leadership problem.”

If this crisis were indeed to hit American shores let’s not forget who is to blame.

The tournament is co-sanctioned with the LPGA Tour giving the former Oklahoma State star access to join the LPGA.

Stark started the final round 2 shots behind Amanda Doherty and quickly seized control with a 31 on the front nine at Galgorm Castle. She had nine birdies through 14 holes and turned a tight race into a rout.

She finished at 20-under 271 5 shots clear of Allisen Corpuz who closed with a 68.

The tournament was held at Galgorm Castle and Massereene played concurrently with a European Tour event. The men and women competed separately but for the same prize fund with Stark collecting a career-high $225000 from the $1.5 million purse.

Ewen Ferguson went wire-to-wire in the men's event shooting a 1-under 69 on Sunday to win by 3 strokes over Borja Virto and Connor Syme.

Stark 22 won two times on the LET late last year. She was the runner-up and low female player in the Asian Mixed Stableford and then captured the Women's New South Wales Open and the Amundi German Masters.

She can take immediate LPGA membership or wait until 2023 for her rookie year. The LPGA Tour has nine tournaments left on its schedule before the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in November.

The tournament is co-sanctioned with the LPGA Tour giving the former Oklahoma State star access to join the LPGA.

Stark started the final round two shots behind Amanda Doherty and quickly seized control with a 31 on the front nine at Galgorm Castle. She had nine birdies through 14 holes and turned a tight race into a rout.

Stark finished at 20-under 271 five shots clear of Allisen Corpuz who closed with a 68.

The tournament was held at Galgorm Castle and Massereene played concurrently with an official European tour event. The men and women competed separately but for the same prize fund with Stark collecting a career-high $225000 from the $1.5 million purse.

Stark won two times on the LET late last year. She was runner-up (and low female) in the Asian Mixed Stableford and then captured the Women’s New South Wales Open and the Amundi German Masters.

Apart from that he ordered the criminals to kidnap his estranged wife and inject her with heroin so she would drop divorce proceedings.

Ilg now faces five to eight years of prison time. The US authorities will announce the exact punishment in November 2022.

The FBI Prevented the Crimes

Despite his profession Ronald Ilg was willing to cause significant harm to one of his former colleagues. In 2021 he contacted numerous killers on the notorious Dark Web insisting that they injure or even break the hands of the victim. To conceal his identity he used the pseudonym “Scar215” and the password “Mufassa$$.”

Initially Ilg transferred $2000 worth of bitcoin to the criminals and provided them with the victim’s picture and address. He also insisted on evidence once the beating was done and assured that there will be another task in the future:

“I would like to see evidence that it happened. If this goes well I have another more complicated job for an entirely different target with entirely different objectives.”

The subject of his next crime was his estranged wife who had already filed divorce papers against him. He paid nearly $60000 in BTC to the Dark Web wrongdoers so they could kidnap her and inject her with heroin. Under the effect of the drugs Ilg expected she could return to their failed marriage life and drop the divorce plans.

Fortunately for the victims the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) detected the scheme and obtained copies of the former doctor’s messages with the hitmen. During a voluntary interview with the agency he falsely claimed he wanted to commit suicide. He also sent a letter to a key witness in the case against him – begging her to marry him so he could control the whole process.

“This case demonstrates how violent offenders exploit cyberspace and cryptocurrency to further their criminal agendas. Mr. Ilg solicited and paid for multiple dark web hitmen to target the two victims in this case. Mr. Ilg also wanted to target additional victims if the hitmen followed through with the plan to harm these first two victims” US Attorney Waldref commented on the crimes.

For his part Michael Heiler – top agent at the FBI – assured that the organization will continue looking for such crimes trying to prevent them before it’s too late.

The Department of Justice will reveal Ronald Ilg’s sentence on November 8. He could go behind bars for 60 to 96 months.

The Similar Case of Jessica Sledge

Earlier this month the Ameican authorities sent the 40-year-old resident of Pelahatchie Mississippi – Jessica Sledge – to Federal Prison for a period of 10 years. Her crime: she paid $10K worth of bitcoin to a Dark Web hitman who had to kill her husband.

Like the aforementioned case the FBI detected the murderous plot and brought Sledge to justice. Apart from the 120 months of jail time she was slammed with a $1000 fine while law enforcement agents will strictly monitor her actions for a term of three years after she gets released."

The globe is in the grips of a climate crisis as temperatures soar and rivers run dry and yet it’s never been a better time to make money by digging up coal The energy-market shockwaves from Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine mean the world is only getting more dependent on the most-polluting fuel. And as demand expands and prices surge to all-time highs that means blockbuster profits for the biggest coal producers.Commodities giant Glencore Plc reported core earnings from its coal unit surged almost 900% to $8.9 billion in the first half — more than Starbucks Corp. or Nike Inc. made in an entire year. No. 1 producer Coal India Ltd .’s profit nearly tripled also to a record while the Chinese companies that produce more than half the world’s coal saw first-half earnings more than double to a combined $80 billion.The massive profits are yielding big pay days for investors. But they will make it even harder for the world to kick the habit of burning coal for fuel as producers work to squeeze out extra tons and boost investment in new mines. If more coal is mined and burned that would make the likelihood of keeping global warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius even more remote.It’s a remarkable turnaround for an industry that spent years mired in an existential crisis as the world tries to shift to cleaner fuels to slow global warming. Banks have been pledging to end financing companies divested mines and power plants and last November world leaders came close to a deal to eventually end its use.Ironically those efforts have helped fuel coal producers’ success as a lack of investment has constrained supply. And demand is higher than ever as Europe tries to wean itself off Russian imports by importing more seaborne coal and liquefied natural gas leaving less fuel for other nations to fight over. Prices at Australia’s Newcastle port the Asian benchmark surged to a record in July.The impact on profits for the coal miners has been stunning and investors are now cashing in. Glencore’s bumper earnings allowed the company to increase returns to shareholders by another $4.5 billion this year with the promise of more to come.Gautam Adani Asia’s richest person capitalized on a rush in India to secure import cargoes amid a squeeze on local supply. Revenue generated by his Adani Enterprises Ltd . jumped more than 200% in the three months to June 30 propelled by higher coal prices.US producers are also reaping bumper profits and the biggest miners Arch Resources Inc. and Peabody Energy Corp. say demand is so strong at European power plants that some customers are buying the high-quality fuel typically used to make steel to generate electricity instead.The wild profits threaten to become a political lightning rod as a handful of coal companies cash in while consumers pay the price. Electricity costs in Europe are at record highs and people in developing nations are suffering daily blackouts because their utilities can’t afford to import fuel. Earlier this month United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres lashed out at energy companies saying their profits were immoral and calling for windfall taxes.Coal’s advocates say the fuel remains the best way to provide cheap and reliable baseload power especially in developing countries. Despite the huge renewable rollout burning coal remains the world’s favorite way to make power accounting for 35% of all electricity.While western producers cash in on the record prices — with companies such as Glencore committed to running mines to closure over the next 30 years — top coal consumers India and China still have growth on the agenda.The Chinese government has tasked its industry with boosting production capacity by 300 million tons this year and the nation’s top state-owned producer said it would boost development investment by more than half on the back of record profits.Coal India is also likely to pour a large chunk of its earnings back into developing new mines under government pressure to do more to keep pace with demand from power plants and heavy industry.China and India worked together at a UN conference in Glasgow last year to water down language in a global climate statement to call for a “phase down” of coal use instead of a “phase out.”At the time few would have predicted just how expensive the fuel would become. Just a year ago the biggest international mining companies — excluding Glencore — were in a full retreat from coal deciding the paltry returns were not worth the increasing pressure from investors and climate activists.When Anglo American Plc spun off its coal business and handed it over to existing shareholders one short seller Boatman Capital said the new business was worth nothing. Instead the stock — known as Thungela Resources Ltd . — skyrocketed gaining more than 1000% since its June 2021 listing with first-half earnings per share up about 20-fold.Glencore itself snapped up a Colombian mine from former partners Anglo and BHP Group. The nature of the deal and rising coal prices meant Glencore essentially got the mine for free by the end of last year. In the first six months of this year it made $2 billion in profit from that one mine more than double its entire coal businesses earnings in the same period last year.The earnings look set to keep rolling in as analysts and coal executives say the market will remain tight.“As we stand today we don’t see this energy crisis going going away for some time” Glencore Chief Executive Officer Gary Nagle said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9jb3VudGRvd24tMjA0Ny13aWxsLWluZGlhLWZpbmFsbHktYmUtYS1wbGVhc2FudC1oZWFsdGh5LWFuZC1zYWZlLWNsaW1hdGljLXRlcnJpdG9yeS10by1saXZlLWluL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzNTYxNjgwLmNtc9IBogFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9jb3VudGRvd24tMjA0Ny13aWxsLWluZGlhLWZpbmFsbHktYmUtYS1wbGVhc2FudC1oZWFsdGh5LWFuZC1zYWZlLWNsaW1hdGljLXRlcnJpdG9yeS10by1saXZlLWluL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MzU2MTY4MC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Countdown 2047: Will India finally be a pleasant healthy and safe climatic territory to live in?,"

India is among the most polluted countries in the world. Nearly 60% of its energ y demand is met through coal and fossil fuel groundwater levels are depleting and the need to fulfil the aspirations of a billion people often requires making way for roads housing and industry even in pristine areas.And yet 25 years from now India holds a clear promise of transformation simply because the ball has been set rolling by the global urgency and consensus on climate change its tangible impact on our lives and new market demands dictating a green shift.India has one key advantage — the bulk of its future infrastructure and industry is yet to be built. The shifts are happening slowly but steadily. The largest railway network in the world is racing to go net zero by the end of this decade.The country is looking at a 500GW renewable energy mobilisation within a decade or less. It’s betting strongly on new and green technology for all-round decarbonisation and industry is playing ball. Top corporate groups from Ambani to Adani have announced big funding for green hydrogen plans which could — within this decade — change the way energy production and consumption operates in India and in fact across the globe.Policy and politics must keep pace.This month India will commit globally that by 2030 it will reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% from 2005 levels and achieve 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil-fuel-based resources. Parliament is set to approve a law that will mandate energy-sensitive building construction.The electric vehicle policy promises to make way for the largest fleet of vehicles running on clean fuel. A National Clean Air Programme is in place to reduce particulate matter air pollution in 122 cities by 2024.Last month India banned 19 categories of single-use plastics.

The just-introduced tax on windfall energy profits of oil refiners like Reliance Industries is not only levied on the diesel they export but also on the supplies they make to fuel retailers within India sources said. The government on July 1 levied Rs 13 per litre additional excise duty on diesel exported out of India. A Rs 6 a litre tax was also imposed on petrol and ATF exported out of India. Alongside it imposed export restrictions subject to meeting domestic sales of 50 per cent for petrol and 30 per cent for diesel exports In subsequent fortnightly reviews the government scrapped the export tax on petrol and jet fuel (ATF) and more than halved the export tax on diesel to Rs 5 per litre.The windfall tax was targeted mainly at Reliance Industries Ltd and Russian oil major Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy  who the government believed were making a killing on exporting large volumes of fuel made from discounted Russian oil at the cost of the domestic market three sources with knowledge of the matter said.Post July 1 refiners exporting petrol and diesel would have had lower realisations and for continued exports they had to shore up domestic supplies either through supplies to state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) bulk sales or retail.But the state-owned fuel retailers like Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd BPCL ) who have a sizeable dependence on supplies from standalone refineries to feed their vast retail network started paying for petrol and diesel bought from Reliance and others after deducting the newly imposed additional excise duty.Sources said for sales to OMCs refiners realize international prices as refinery transfer prices are 80 per cent of import parity and 20 per cent of export parity (the average of 80 per cent of the price at which petrol or diesel be imported and 20 per cent of the rate at which these fuels can be exported).The 2.5 per cent customs duty on petrol and diesel is also considered for calculating the trade parity price.Post July 1 the OMCs started reducing export taxes from this calculation resulting in lower realisation they said.This principle was applicable to all supplies bought from standalone refineries of Reliance Industries Nayara Energy Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd ( CPCL ) and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd.Reached for comments a top finance ministry official said the government has not imposed any tax on domestic supplies by refineries.""OMCs must be doing it on their own and rightly so. The pricing is always based on an alternate market or source. If the alternate market for these refiners is export where they have to pay the tax to the government a similar deduction on supplies made elsewhere is justified.""The Indian fuel retail scene is dominated by state-owned firms Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) BPCL and HPCL.While IOC - the market leader - is largely self-sufficient in producing petrol and diesel in its own refineries and its subsidiary CPCL BPCL and HPCL do not have oil refining capacity commensurate with their retail operations. And so BPCL and HPCL depend on supplies from standalone refineries - the units that process crude oil into fuel but either have no retailing business or a very limited presence.Reliance which operates two refineries - one only for exports and the other for the domestic market has 1470 petrol pumps out of 83685 petrol pumps in the country. Nayara Energy has 6635 pumps.These outlets of the private sector heavily restricted sales beginning March/April as they couldn't afford to sell petrol and diesel at a loss since public sector competition froze rates to help the government contain inflation.This diverted traffic to public sector petrol pumps which were also flooded with bulk users like state road transport corporation buses. Bulk users flocked to petrol pumps as rates there were subsidised in comparison to the market price they otherwise would have to pay.Simultaneously the private refineries started ramping up exports to capture the supply deficit created by the war in Ukraine The deadly combination resulted in petrol pumps in several locations going dry prompting the government to clamp down.This clampdown has helped resort supplies but standalone refineries lost heavily.Sources said initially the export duty was applicable on all exports including from Reliance's SEZ but in subsequent revisions the tax on only-for-exports refineries was dropped."

But why celebrate such a seemingly minor change? Because colored plastics are a major barrier to recycling.

Companies that buy recycled plastic bottles and containers prefer clear plastic. It's the easiest thing to process into new containers said Jeff Smithberger director of solid waste for Mecklenburg County.

""They certainly don't want green or brown or blue or another color mixed in with it because it's just so time intensive to try to separate out those colors. It seems like there's always one or two of the colored types of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastics mixed in with a regular clear load"" Smithberger said in an interview.

More Coca-Cola brands also changing

In its announcement  Coca-Cola also said it will shift all of its current green bottles to clear in the coming months including the Fresca Seagram's and Mello Yello brands. And it pledged begin using 100% recycled plastic in most Dasani water bottles in the U.S. and all Dasani bottles in Canada.

Manufacturers usually don't worry about whether a container can be recycled. Colors are part of their marketing. Sprite is closely associated with green for example. And blue green or orange is part of the branding for many laundry detergents.

So Smithberger applauds Coca-Cola's decision to ditch the green.

""This is a real win for the recycling community and for the sustainability aspect of Coca-Cola. to make their products in clear colored plastic packaging that then can be more readily recycled"" he said.

Pressure on marketers to change

Mecklenburg County is a part of a nationwide effort called the Product Sustainability Group that has been lobbying big consumer product makers to start worrying about recycling and this is a small win. For Smithberger the question is who's next?

David Boraks / WFAE Jeff Smithberger at the Mecklenburg County recycling center.

""There are a few other bottling companies for us to challenge to 'dew' the same thing"" he joked in an email referring to one of Sprite's biggest competitors that also uses a green bottle.

""We would like to believe that the discussions that we've had and others in the Product Sustainability Group have had with manufacturers are starting to pay off because we know that consumers want these products at the end of their life to be used for a better and higher order"" Smithberger said in the interview.

Coca-Cola says recycling more will ensure there's more PET available to reuse.

""Demand for rPET (recycled PET) currently exceeds supply so the first step to scaling up use of 100% rPET across our portfolio is building a sustainable pipeline of high-quality material” Chris Vallette Coca-Cola's senior vice president of technical innovation and stewardship said in a press release. “We do this by working with communities to boost PET recycling and collection; collaborating with recycling partners; and finally securing rPET to help ensure the material for our bottles is used again and again.""

The announcement affects all of Coca-Cola's operations including those at Charlotte-based Coca-Cola Consolidated  the largest Coke bottler that operates in 14 states. Julian Ochoa is CEO of R3CYCLE  which is helping Coca-Cola Consolidated turn bottles back into bottles.

“Taking colors out of bottles improves the quality of the recycled material” Ochoa said in Coke's press release. “This transition will help increase availability of food-grade rPET. When recycled clear PET Sprite bottles can be remade into bottles helping drive a circular economy for plastic.”

So that prompts another question for our local recycling guru Jeff Smithberger: Can plastic actually be recycled over and over?

He laughed and said: ""We've never seen anything that's been recycled to the 100% mark. So we don't know. But we certainly hope that it will be continually able to be recycled.""

Smithberger said there are limits to how much any material can be recycled. ""We do know that certain paper products do not have an infinite life in recycling"" he said. ""Something that may today be a cardboard box may end up being something that's more of a brown roll of paper later on just because fiber length changes.""

""I think the jury's still out on whether or not we can continually recycle plastic over and over to the same type and grade. But we'll certainly be watching and working with the manufacturers. But we want to certainly give it a chance"" he said.

Recycling only goes so far

If we're going to continue using plastic bottles we need more recycling. The federal EPA estimates that only about 9% of plastics from municipal trash pickups are recycled. Some types of plastic have a better track record: 29% of PET and HDPE (high-density polyethylene) plastic bottles are recycled every year according to the EPA. That's still lower than aluminum beer and soft drink cans (50%) and glass beer soft drink wine and liquor bottles (about 40%) the EPA says.

But a change of color doesn't really solve the bigger problem — a growing stream of plastic coming into the market. Even if producers and recyclers solved the color sorting problem most plastic from the municipal solid waste collection still doesn't go for recycling the EPA says. Instead most goes to landfills and some is burned for energy which emits greenhouse gases.

""Coca-Cola's recent announcement is yet another blatant greenwashing attempt from one of the world's worst plastic polluters"" Kate Melges of the Plastics Project at Greenpeace told NPR reporter Becky Sullivan . ""We are in the midst of a massive plastic pollution crisis and we cannot recycle our way out of it.""

Environmentalists want to see a shift away from plastic which in production transportation and disposal creates greenhouse gases that cause global warming.

Meanwhile some plastic doesn't even make it into recycling bins or landfills. Millions of tons of plastic water and soft drink bottles wind up waterways lakes or oceans every year. There it breaks up into tiny particles called ""microplastics."" Another argument for alternatives.

Starting Aug. 1 the Coca-Cola Co. which produces Sprite will package the lemon-lime drink in clear plastic bottles in North America the company announced Wednesday.

By bottling Sprite in clear plastic Coca-Cola says the bottles will be able to be recycled more times. One goal the company says is to increase the supply of recycled plastic that the company can then use to make future bottles.

""Taking colors out of bottles improves the quality of the recycled material"" Julian Ochoa the CEO of R3CYCLE a plastic recycling company working with Coca-Cola said in a statement.

Sprite's green plastic bottles were already recyclable. But colored plastic bottles are typically separated from clear plastic bottles during the recycling process in order to keep the recycled plastic from becoming discolored Coca-Cola said. The green Sprite bottles were more often recycled into things like clothes and carpeting which are more difficult to recycle again.

Environmental groups say single-use plastic is the problem

Environmental organizations say the problem with Sprite bottles is not the color but the material: single-use plastic.

""Coca-Cola's recent announcement is yet another blatant greenwashing attempt from one of the world's worst plastic polluters"" said Kate Melges who leads the Plastics Project at Greenpeace. ""We are in the midst of a massive plastic pollution crisis and we cannot recycle our way out of it.""

Coca-Cola produces more than 100 billion plastic bottles every year according to data it provided in 2019 to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation making it one of the world's largest producers of single-use plastic waste.

Soft drink bottles are usually made of a type of plastic called polyethylene terephthalate or PET. PET is lightweight food-safe and recyclable — but like other plastics PET can take hundreds of years to decompose.

In the U.S. only about 29% of PET plastic is recycled according to the EPA.

""Bottles with recycled content will still be thrown away sent to landfills or littered"" said Matt Littlejohn of Oceana an ocean conservation organization.

Concerns about single-use plastic have led to calls for food and beverage companies to increase sustainability by avoiding the creation of new plastic where possible.

Coca-Cola has previously pledged to boost sustainability

Coca-Cola has previously made a variety of sustainability pledges including promises to increase the portion of its packaging that can be recycled — currently 90% with a goal of 100% by 2025 — and to increase the percentage of recycled material used to make its packaging — currently 23% with a goal of 50% by 2030.

In recent years Coca-Cola has experimented with bottles made entirely of recyclable PET — also called rPET — along with the use of plant-based material.

""Demand for rPET currently exceeds supply so the first step to scaling up use of 100% rPET across our portfolio is building a sustainable pipeline of high-quality material"" said Chris Vallette Coca-Cola's senior vice president of technical innovation and stewardship.

The clear Sprite bottles were first introduced last year in a smaller 13.2-oz bottle in a handful of regions across the U.S.

Other Coca-Cola drinks that come in green plastic bottles — including Fresca Seagram's and Mello Yello — will also transition to clear plastic bottles.

In the statement the company also announced that its brand of bottled water Dasani will be packaged in bottles made entirely from recycled plastic. Coca-Cola estimates that will save more than 20 million pounds of newly created plastic compared to 2019 — a savings that represents a tiny fraction of the company's overall plastic production.

Environmental organizations like Greenpeace and Oceana have called on the company to move from single-use plastic bottles to refillable bottles.

Coca-Cola says its goal is for at least 25% of its beverages globally to be sold in reusable or returnable containers by 2030. That includes drinks sold at soda fountains and in glass bottles. Refillable and returnable packaging made up 16% of sales in 2020 the company says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVzc2FuZGpvdXJuYWwuY28udWsvZnAvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2Zvb2QtYW5kLWRyaW5rLzQ2NTk1OTgvY29jYS1jb2xhLWZvdXItc3VwZXJtYXJrZXQtYnJhbmRzLXVsdGltYXRlLWNvbGEtdGFzdGUtdGVzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We compare king of pop Coca-Cola against four supermarket brands in the ultimate cola taste test,"Coca-Cola has long marketed itself as the ‘real thing’ but what happened when we put the king of the fizz up against a clutch of supermarket-brand wannabees in a taste test for the ages.

We got our panel of expert tasters to see whether Coke really is it or whether far cheaper alternatives can give it a run for its crown.

We also took the winning supermarket cola out on to the streets to see if the public preferred it to Coca-Cola.

Supermarket colas may lack the branding power of the world’s best known soft drink but fame might not be all it’s cracked up to be.

And as the supermarket brands sell for a fraction of the price there’s a lot to be gained from switching sodas.

We’re back with our sixth instalment of Battle of the Brands our weekly series aiming to help readers grab a food shop bargain as the cost of living crisis continues to affect everyone across the country.

This week Coca-Cola is in the spotlight as it goes up against some supermarket favourites. But what wins out?

Who knows you may even find yourself preferring the alternatives – and your wallet would likely thank you for it too.

The items and supermarkets we tried against Coca Cola include:

Aldi Vive Cola

Asda Cola

Morrisons Cola

Tesco Classic Cola (winner)

Coca Cola

Price: £1.70

Much to the surprise of the team this was Karla’s first taste test of full-sugar Coca-Cola.

Unfortunately it was a bit of a disappointment – all she could taste was sugar. That is hardly surprising considering that The Coca-Cola Co decided to retain Coke’s high sugar levels after the UK sugar tax was introduced a few years back.

Other colas reduced their sugar content which is why Coca-Cola is sweeter – and more expensive – than rivals.

Overall however the team preferred the taste of Coca-Cola. Everything else just didn’t seem quite right.

Overall team scores:

Value for money: 2/5

Nutritional value: 1/5

Taste: 4/5

Mouthfeel: 4/5

Price: 60p per two litres

The Tesco cola was deemed not as “synthetic” as the other supermarket colas which is certainly damning with faint praise.

While not as popular with the team as Coca-Cola Tesco’s attempt was at least a decent try compared to the other options on the table.

Overall team scores:

Value for money: 4/5 Nutritional value: 2/5 Taste: 2.5/5 Mouthfeel: 3/5



Public’s verdict

Some of our previous battles came out fairly even but Coca-Cola walks it this week. Tesco’s cola was powerless against the mighty soda king and almost everyone we spoke to knew exactly which was which.

Tesco’s chances weren’t helped by the sheer coincidence of one of our tasters coming from Atlanta the home of Coca-Cola. But even without that Coca-Cola would have easily won.

Tune in next week where we’ll be putting Kellogg’s cornflakes up against supermarket brands to find out if their versions are better.

Mario Cristobal Miami

Marta Lavandier/AP Miami head coach Mario Cristobal supervises the warm-up period at the team's football facility Friday Aug. 5 2022 in Coral Gables Fla.

Miami wasn't exactly discreet in its quest to land Mario Cristobal but in the end new athletic director Dan Radakovich got his guy. The former offensive lineman won two national championships with the Hurricanes and returns to his alma mater looking to add another one to the trophy case. But it's been a long time for Miami. Cristobal has proven he can win previously guiding Florida International and Oregon to conference crowns but now he's being asked to restore this once-proud national powerhouse program to its glory days.

Scott Frost Nebraska

Rebecca S. Gratz/AP Nebraska head coach Scott Frost watches from the field during the second half of the team's annual red-white spring game Saturday April 9 2022 at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln Neb. The white team defeated the red team 43-39.

It's now or never for Nebraska alumnus Scott Frost. Unlike Cristobal Frost is on borrowed time with the Cornhuskers. The former Nebraska quarterback hasn't won more than five games at his alma mater and is 15-29 in four seasons. Athletic director Trev Alberts seems lukewarm on Frost affirming that the 47-year-old would be back in 2022 but reducing his salary by $1 million and lowering the buyout. Frost is on notice – show some improvement or find a new job.

Brian Kelly Louisiana State

John Bazemore/AP LSU head coach Brian Kelly speaks during a news conference at the Southeastern Conference media days Monday July 18 2022 in Atlanta.

After 12 years at Notre Dame Brian Kelly decided to take the money and run. Louisiana State lured him to the bayou with a 10-year $95 million contract. The last three LSU coaches (Nick Saban Les Miles and Ed Oregeron) led the Tigers to a national title. Now it's his turn to try.

Billy Napier Florida

John Bazemore/AP Florida head coach Billy Napier speaks during a news conference at the Southeastern Conference media days Wednesday July 20 2022 in Atlanta.

Billy Napier was a winner at Louisiana going 40-12 with a pair of Sun Belt Conference championships in four seasons. But can he replicate that success at Florida? He certainly has the pedigree serving under Saban at Alabama and Dabo Swinney at Clemson. Napier's success will likely begin on the recruiting trail where he'll need to make up lost footing from the rather large hole that predecessor Dan Mullen left him to fill.

The Trojans have been down and out in South Central for some time now but the splash hire of Lincoln Riley from Oklahoma seems to have reinvigorated alumni and fans alike. Riley was 55-10 in five seasons at Oklahoma winning four Big 12 Conference titles and punching a ticket to three consecutive College Football Playoff berths in each of his first three years there. There will be a short window for him to make an early impression at USC.

Videos by American Songwriter

The festival which has been held in Mexico’s Rosarito Beach since 2018 spans Friday (August 12) through Sunday (August 21) weekends only.

On Saturday (Aug.13) officials said the festival will continue despite those reports of violence fires and roadblocks in nearby areas. The news comes amidst a Tijuana consulate order that U.S. government employees shelter in place until further notice.

Media reports from nearby areas have alerted residents to cars on fire and police activity in Tijuana Mexicali Rosarito Ensenada and Tecate as recently as Friday night (Aug 12). Reports also indicated that in Ciudad Juarez there were multiple businesses torched and 11 people killed.

According to reports the violence seems to have been enflamed over a dispute between rival cartel gangs.

Festival officials wrote on social media that they were cognizant “of the unfortunate events.”

They added “Safety is our number one concern when organizing an event of this size” the post read. “We have been working diligently with city state and federal officials and have been advised that these events were isolated and that all safety measures are being taken in the surrounding areas in Baja to ensure you have a safe and memorable experience.”

The post continued “As always look out for your friends and if you see anything please call local authorities and direct all communication directly us Baja Beach Fest (email [email protected].).”

According to an email sent to Rolling Stone organizers of the festival said things at the festival itself were going well. The email read “Last night Baja Beach Fest safely transported 3500+ festival attendees to and from Tijuana and Rosarito with no issues” the email said. “We have increased the amount of shuttle busses available in Tijuana for all fans who might be experiencing transport issues (based on availability).”

Organizers added that highway and toll roads were clear and there were no reports of border crossing issues and hotels in the nearby towns mentioned above hadn’t reported problems.

As of Saturday no acts had cancelled—headlines for the weekend included Daddy Yankee Brandi MS and more. Though Rolling Stone reports that performers off the record noted feeling fearful of the violence.

Dominican musician Tokischa who performed Friday tweeted “As a person I never imagined I’d be escorted by the police so I can go from Tijuana to Rosarito back & forth cuz there’s a cartel curfew my respect to everyone that’s been going through all this in Mexico.”

Differing reports from attendees have expressed concern wondering why the festival was continuing while others said everything was being blown out of proportion.

Jason Sanders kicked four field goals including a 53-yarder that put the Dolphins ahead for good with just under seven minutes remaining.

Kyle Trask drove the Bucs into position to potentially win the game but Jose Borregales' 49-yard field goal attempt hit the right upright and bounced away as time expired.

The Bucs announced Thursday that Brady who practiced the previous day against the Dolphins will not rejoin the team until after next weekend's preseason game at Tennessee.

Gabbert a 12th-year pro who backed up Brady the past two seasons started Saturday night and worked two series. His 23-yard touchdown pass to Jaelon Darden gave the Bucs an early lead. Trask extended it by completing five of six passes for 67 yards on a long drive Ke’Shawn Vaughn finished with a 1-yard scoring run.

Trask followed that up with a pair of costly turnovers: an interception on an ill-advised pass intended for rookie running back Rachaad White and a fumble that Miami linebacker Sam Eguavoen returned 32 yards for a second-quarter TD.

What happens when you push a small snowball down a hill… And what does this have to do with growing wealthy?

When you push a small snowball down a hill it continuously picks up snow. When it reaches the bottom of the hill it is a giant snow boulder.



Source: Calvin & Hobbes

The snowball compounds during its travel down the hill. The bigger it gets the more snow it packs on with each revolution. The snowball effect is a metaphor for compounding. It explains how small actions carried out over time can lead to big results.

In the same way investing in high-quality dividend growth stocks can generate large amounts of dividend income over long periods of time. Investors looking for the best dividend growth stocks should consider the Dividend Aristocrats a group of 65 stocks in the S&P 500 with 25+ consecutive years of dividend growth.

The Power of The Snowball Effect

Before we discuss how to harness the power of the snowball effect we must understand the power of compounding.

The snowball metaphor visually shows the power of compounding.

“The most powerful force in the world is compound interest”

– Attributed to Albert Einstein

Here’s the power of compound interest:

Imagine you invested $1 that compounded at 1% a day. In 5 years your $1 would grow to over $77 million. You would be the richest person in the world by year 7.

Keep in mind that compounding is not a get rich quick scheme. It takes time – and lots of it. There are no investments that compound at 1% a day in the real world.

The stock market has compounded wealth (adjusting for inflation) at ~7.1% a year over the long run. At this rate an investment in the stock market has historically doubled every 10.1 years.

It takes more time to compound wealth in the real world – but that doesn’t make the principles of compounding any less powerful.

Take Warren Buffett as an example. Warren Buffett is worth over $100 billion. Warren Buffett’s wealth comes from the tremendous benefits of the snowball effect through time.

Warren Buffett compounded his wealth through a specific type of investment.

Specifically Buffett invests in:

Shareholder-friendly businesses With strong competitive advantages Trading at fair or better prices

“All there is to investing is picking good stocks at good times and staying with them as long as they remain good companies.”

– Warren Buffett

The next section of this article discusses how to harness the power of the snowball effect by investing in the same type of businesses Warren Buffett does.

How You Can Harness The Snowball Effect

You can harness the power of the snowball effect by investing in the same type of businesses that have made Warren Buffett so wealthy over time.

Looking at Berkshare Hathaway’s portfolio its top 5 stocks (as of its most recent 13F filing) make up 74.7% of the portfolio:

42.09% is invested in Apple Inc. (AAPL)

11.26% is invested in Bank of America (BAC)

7.67% is invested in American Express (AXP)

7.01% is invested in Chevron Corporation (CVX)

6.71% is invested in Cola-Cola (KO)

These 5 Warren Buffett stocks represent a compounding machine. Do you know what’s interesting about these 5 business?

All 5 are well-established businesses that pay dividends.

Apple has a 0.7% dividend yield

Bank of America has a 2.7% dividend yield

American Express has a 1.4% dividend yield

Chevron has a 3.4% dividend yield

Coca-Cola has a 3.0% dividend yield

The average dividend yield of Berkshire Hathaway’s top 5 stocks is 2.2%. Warren Buffett holds a concentrated portfolio of businesses with above-average dividend yields and long histories of dividend payments to shareholders.

Investing in this type of business is the surest way to benefit from the snowball effect.

The good news is you don’t even have to search for these businesses. There is a list of 44 businesses with 50+ years of consecutive dividend increasescalled the Dividend Kings list.

Nothing says long-term success like 50 or more years of paying rising dividends in a row.

Coca-Cola (one of Buffett’s biggest investments) is a Dividend King. There are many other well-known stocks in the Dividend Kings list including:

Procter & Gamble (PG)

3M (MMM)

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

You may read this and think: “these businesses may have a history of success but isn’t their run over”?

Investors have wasted tremendous sums of money chasing ‘the new hot stock’. You cannot benefit from the snowball effect by investing in businesses that are unproven. Steady dependable results lead to wealth multiplication.

What would happen if you had invested in some of the most well-known Dividend Kings in 1990?

The 7 example businesses below all had 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases by the end of 1990. They were well-known blue-chip stocks in 1990.

It didn’t take a genius to buy and hold them…

But the results speak for themselves. Five examples of the snowball effect in action are below. All examples assume dividends were reinvested.



Example #1: The Coca-Cola Company (KO)

Coca-Cola compounded investor wealth at over 14% a year (including dividends) over the last 30 years. Coca-Cola was the largest soda brand in the United States in 1990… And had a 98 year operating history at the time. It was not a start-up.

Coca-Cola stock ended 1991 at a share price of $4.94 per share adjusted for splits and reinvested dividends. The stock closed at $58.76 per share on December 31st 2021. That means the stock generated annualized returns of 8.6% per year over the 30-year period from 1991-2021.



Example #2: Lowe’s Companies (LOW)

Lowe’s is the second-largest home improvement store in the United States behind only The Home Depot (HD). In 1991 Lowe’s was one of the largest home improvement stores in the United States. It had a dividend history of over 25 consecutive years of increases even then.

Investors in Lowe’s 30 years ago have done very well…

Lowe’s ended 2021 trading at an adjusted price of $256.59. With an adjusted price of $0.76 to end 1991 (accounting for stock splits and reinvested dividends) Lowe’s stock delivered compound annual returns of 21% per year over the past 30 years.

This means a $1000 investment 30 years ago would be worth just over $336000 to begin 2022.

Example #3: Procter & Gamble (PG)

Procter & Gamble was just as well-known in 1990 as it is today. The company has an iconic brand portfolio with names like Tide Bounty Gillette and Charmin (among many others).

The company was founded in 1837. In 1990 Procter & Gamble had been around for 153 years… Not exactly a young company.

Still long-term investors in Procter & Gamble have done well. The stock has produced 30-year annualized total returns of 11.9% a year.

Example #4: Colgate-Palmolive (CL)

Colgate-Palmolive traces its history back to 1806. Both the Colgate and Palmolive brands are easily recognized.

In addition to these brands Colgate-Palmolive owns the Speed Stick Soft Soap and Hill’s brands (among many others).

Colgate-Palmolive has paid dividends since 1893. The company has paid increasing dividends for over 50 consecutive years. In 1991 the company had a streak of 28 consecutive dividend increases.

How did 1991 investors do?

Colgate-Palmolive generated a compound annual returns of 11.5% during this 30-year period.

Example #5: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Johnson & Johnson is currently the largest health care corporation in the world. The company is one of the most stable businesses in the world as well.

This stability is reflected in Johnson & Johnson’s long history of dividend payments to shareholders. This ‘slow and steady’ business has been a boon for shareholders over the long-run.

The company generated compound returns of 11.2% a year for shareholders during this time period.

The company’s low stock price volatility only adds to its appeal. Investors have historically generated excellent returns with Johnson & Johnson stock without as many gut-wrenching ups and downs as compared to other stocks.

Snowball-Effect Stocks For The Next 25 Years

All 5 examples above trounced the market despite being well established businesses with long dividend histories.

But…

What stocks will be the next snowball effect compounders?

There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Anyone holding the serial compounders above should continue to do so.

For those looking to enter into new positions in snowball effect stocks should look for the following:

Above average dividend yield Below average price-to-earnings ratio Long dividend history

The biggest constraint of the 3 is the long dividend history. We will start by selecting only from the Dividend Aristocrats List.

To be a Dividend Aristocrat a stock must have 25+ years of consecutive dividend payments and be in the S&P 500. There are currently 65 stocks that match this criteria.

Out of the 65 Dividend Aristocrats we will screen for:

A dividend yield above the S&P 500’s 1.7% yield A price-to-earnings below the S&P 500’s ratio of 18.8

We will then sort these by expected total return. Total return is the expected earnings-per-share growth rate plus the current dividend yield as well as the net impact of any positive or negative changes in the price-to-earnings multiple.

The 10 highest expected total return Dividend Aristocrats with above market dividend yields and below market price-to-earnings ratios are listed below:

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK): Expected return of 19.9%

V.F. Corp (VFC): Expected return of 17.1%

3M Company (MMM): Expected return of 17.0%

Lowe’s Companies (LOW): Expected return of 15.3%

T. Rowe Price Group (TROW): Expected return of 14.8%

Target Corporation (TGT): Expected return of 14.7%

Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): Expected return of 14.5%

Pentair plc (PNR): Expected return of 14.3%

Franklin Resources (BEN): Expected return of 14.2%

Leggett & Platt (LEG): Expected return of 12.2%

The 10 stocks listed above best match the criteria to best take advantage of the snowball effect.

‘Snowball stocks’ have strong and durable competitive advantages. Evidence of their competitive advantages is seen by their long operating history and consistent dividend increases.

Long-term investing in great businesses with shareholder-friendly managements at fair or better prices will very likely produce compound wealth gains over time.

Remember the snowball effect when choosing your investments.

Which were the brands that ushered India into a new dawn? At the stroke of the midnight hour when India got a new lease of life after freedom brands latched on to the moment with topical ads that would be etched in the annals of history.This was an era when the written word ruled the roost when the print medium was the most dominant. Still most brands steered away from a clever turn of phrase or resorting to attention grabbing headlines. Neither did they take refuge behind attractive offers to wean away consumers and so on.We present a snapshot of brands and their communication on this occasion from the historic edition of The Times of India.As the ads on that momentous day in 1947 suggested the brands would rather opt for a measured formal tone in wishing the people of the country well – probably a reflection of the straightforward consumer of those times. What you saw is what you got!The front page solus position advertisement of the August 15 1947 shouted “It happened in Brooklyn”. It had nothing to do with independent India though. This was MGM’s ad for shows of a Frank Sinatra musical comedy showing in the Metro Theatre of Bombay.Other multinational companies including Colgate Union Life Assurance and The Borden Co. New York (manufacturers of Klim Milk) were not tone deaf to the new dawn of India.Seven-and-a-half decades back it would be safe to presume that newspaper deadlines were even earlier and most ads were designed at the nth hour. The marketing or advertising team at Colgate was probably short on time. It ‘hurriedly’ added a line celebrating freedom to an ‘existing’ ad that was headlined “are you afraid to kiss him?” So did Aryan a national toothbrush brand that headlined an existing creative with the line “Today dawns the liberty – brushing off slavery”.Spirituality was a theme that was loud and clear in the India of those times. So Glaxo Laboratories (now Heinz) wished Indians on the “auspicious” occasion and wished the countrymen “godspeed”. The India Electric Works did pretty much the same.Among the Indian conglomerates Tata Industries (as the Tata Group called itself then) put out an ad on behalf of its group companies Tata Iron and Steel Company Tata Locomotive and Engineering Company Tata Textile Group Tata Hydro Electric Companies Tata ChemicalsTata Oil Mills Company Investment Corporation Of India Air-India and Indian Hotels Company.The ad borrowed lines from a Rabindranath Tagore poem composed in 1913 asking Indians to collectively build a country ‘where the mind is without fear and the head is held high’ while an image of Mother India in the creative paid homage to those who fought and endured suffering so that she may be free.An ad by the Godrej group mixed celebration with introspection. The ad copy stated that there was no land more generously endowed by nature and yet no country that was more poverty-stricken. The ad drummed up the company’s philosophy about national self sufficiency and co-related national hygiene to Godrej soaps and national security to Godrej metal products.There was also the spirit of brands without borders. Many of the brands including the Union Life Assurance Glaxo Colgate-Palmolive and GEC Radio wished the people of the “free dominions of India and Pakistan”.As was the spirit of those days many brands including Allen Berry & Co (Automobile Engineers) The Borden Co. New York India Electric Works and footwear giant Bata wrote their own pledge dedicating their services to the citizens.The Bombay Swadeshi Co-operative stores took this opportunity to connect its own history with India's stating that the foundations of free India and their store were both laid by patriots Dadabhai Naoroji and Lokmanya Tilak.Others who celebrated the dawn of freedom included Usha Fan and Deccan Airways (no relation to Air Deccan that was launched only in 2003) saluted those whose sacrifices made the day possible.As the sun shone brightly on independent India marketers like all other Indians woke up to the promise of freedom and liberty. Along the way they also created communication that stood the test of time.",,,,,,,,,

In the United States outsiders with resources and persistence such as activists and journalists can try to use the legal crowbar of the Freedom of Information Act to pry facts loose. But there is an easier way to look at government secrets and even peruse them at leisure: just be appointed an official government historian. There are hundreds of them working for the various federal agencies in the U.S. salary and benefits decent. Their job is to sift with scholarly thoroughness through raw archival evidence in order to determine how well or badly an agency has carried out its mission. Because these histories are usually published in installments long after the events they describe agencies somehow relax. They permit quasi-independent in-house scholars to poke through their business potentially releasing information that would have brought the agency to its knees if it had been revealed in more timely fashion.

Thomas Wellock formerly a professor at Central Washington University became the historian of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (N.R.C.) more than a decade ago. He brought chops to the job—training in engineering experience testing nuclear reactors and a Ph.D. in history from Berkeley—and in March of 2021 published the sixth in a series of authorized volumes about how the agency and its predecessor the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (A.E.C.) has regulated civilian nuclear power. “Safe Enough? A History of Nuclear Power and Accident Risk” is a refreshingly candid account of how the government from the nineteen-forties onward approached the bottom-line question posed in the book’s title. Technically astute insiders at the A.E.C. took it for granted that “catastrophic accidents” were possible; the key question was: What were the chances? The long and the short of it Wellock’s book suggests is that while many officials believed the chances were very low nobody really knew for sure how low they were or could prove it scientifically. Even as plants were being built the numbers used by officials to describe the likelihood of an accident were based on “expert guesswork or calculations that often produced absurd results” he writes. The “guesswork” nature of such analysis was never candidly acknowledged to either the public or the agency’s licensing boards which had the legal responsibility of determining that individual plants all around the country were safe enough to be approved for operation.

The U.S. nuclear-construction program collapsed decades ago in part because of chronic cost overruns but there are still ninety-two aging nuclear reactors operating in the U.S. and many utility companies want to extend their original forty-year licenses by another twenty years. Around the world more than four hundred reactors are in operation most of them using U.S. designs or similar ones from the sixties and seventies which have documented flaws that are not easily correctable. The nuclear reactors at Fukushima Daiichi Japan for example where meltdowns occurred in 2011 were designed by General Electric; there are thirty-one plants of the same basic G.E. vintage currently operating in the U.S. Wellock discloses internal records describing specific and potentially urgent safety issues still unresolved that pertain directly to many of the nuclear plants operating downwind of major population centers. Some of the foreign operators who rely on U.S. reactor designs may read his book and wonder whether there’s a refund policy.

In recent years as mitigating climate change has become a high priority some energy-policy experts have argued that we should return to building nuclear plants or at least have the federal government sponsor research on new types of reactors with better safety and performance features. In principle nuclear energy remains an appealing technology assuming that the problem of long-term radioactive-waste disposal can be solved. And yet my own studies on reactor safety—which include papers co-authored with the late M.I.T. physicist and Nobel laureate Henry Kendall and several books based on extensive reporting for this magazine—have concluded that nuclear power’s potential contribution to clean energy has been compromised by safety shortcuts taken by the industry and by lax government regulation of day-to-day safety practices at the plants. (I appear in Wellock’s book in part because I served as the executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists—an organization that became “nuclear power’s most effective critic” Wellock writes—from 1972 to 1979.) Studying Wellock’s history which shows what the government got wrong about nuclear power might be helpful in figuring out what the Biden Administration needs to get right if it is to attempt to revive the prospects for nuclear energy. His book also prompts us to ask whether such a revival is desirable given that technologies exist for harnessing the sun and wind which don’t raise daunting safety issues in the first place.

Atoms for Peace the postwar federal nuclear-power program announced by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 aimed to turn swords into plowshares. Nuclear power was presented as the energy source of the future to be delivered at a price “too cheap to meter.” At first it was hard for the program to get off the ground in large part because coal the dominant source for U.S. power production was already cheap and abundant. But a combination of government pressure and loss-leader pricing by nuclear-plant manufacturers led to the creation of a nuclear bandwagon in the nineteen-sixties. (In the seventies an executive with the utility company Florida Power & Light told me that his company had adopted nuclear power so that its leaders wouldn’t be embarrassed on the golf course by other C.E.O.s who had done so.) In the early seventies the A.E.C. predicted that there would be a thousand nuclear reactors operating in the country by 2000—an estimate that would turn out to be off by a thousand percent give or take.

During the Second World War the building of nuclear reactors was exclusively the province of the military. The government Wellock notes thought that it could resolve or at least skirt the technology’s biggest safety issues by building reactors in the desert of Washington State “in the middle of sagebrush and rattlesnakes.” But utility companies keen to avoid constructing expensive long-distance power lines later argued for locating nuclear power plants closer to their customers in urban areas. In the early sixties New York’s Consolidated Edison proposed building a large nuclear plant in Ravenswood Queens—now part of Long Island City—about two miles from Times Square. There were protests including from the former A.E.C. chairman David Lilienthal and the project was nixed. But a nuclear-plant complex remained under development by Con Ed at Indian Point near Croton-on-Hudson some thirty-seven miles away. The A.E.C.’s top advisers questioned whether such reactors could be safely operated so close to metropolitan areas. Wellock cites internal records showing that in a draft letter written in the late sixties the A.E.C.’s principal reactor-safeguards committee warned the agency’s top leadership that unless new emergency cooling technology could be developed future nuclear reactors were “suitable only for rural or remote sites.”

The remote-siting approach not only threatened government ambitions for nuclear power by adding to the costs but was a telltale sign of its inherent dangers; nevertheless the A.E.C. wanted to let plans for building hundreds of large nuclear plants near urban areas move ahead. Wellock finds that the agency’s commissioners intervened to stop the issuance of the letter. (Samuel Jensch who chaired the committee that licensed the Indian Point plant later wrote that licenses for many facilities might have been denied if the government had been forthcoming about its internal concerns; the furnishing of this eye-opening information to the licensing boards he suggested could well have meant the end of commercial nuclear power.) From the sixties onward the A.E.C. used talking points that presented the risks of catastrophic nuclear accidents as “exceedingly low” and “vanishingly small.” Meltdowns—accidents in which the uncontrolled overheating of a reactor’s nuclear fuel creates the potential for the dispersal of radioactive fallout over a large area—were characterized as “incredible events” that for all policymaking purposes could be treated as impossible. A meltdown was supposed to be so unlikely that citizens didn’t have to lose sleep worrying; plant designers similarly were allowed to focus exclusively on preventing lesser mishaps such as temporary cooling-system malfunctions and relieved of the responsibility for building safety systems to try to mitigate accidents in which cooling was lost and could not be restored quickly enough.

For those who are deeply concerned about the safety of nuclear power Wellock’s book paints a disturbing picture. The technical challenge of assuring nuclear safety and of numerically calculating the risk of a bad accident was at the basis of many uncertainties. “A nuclear power plant’s approximately twenty thousand safety components have a Rube Goldberg quality” Wellock writes. “Like dominoes numerous pumps valves and switches must operate in the required sequence to simply pump cooling water or shut down the plant. There were innumerable unlikely combinations of failures that could cause an accident.” And yet even as plants were beginning to be built in larger numbers regulators were realizing that they didn’t have the tools they needed to make reliable safety estimates. If you have substantial data risks can be calculated easily. Insurance companies which pioneered the statistical techniques of risk analysis look at how often accidents of specific types occur under various circumstances. But the nuclear-power industry that emerged in the fifties and sixties was building big plants before it had developed a track record of operating smaller ones. It had no statistics about the safety of the large units it was constructing—novel complex custom-built machines. Stephen Hanauer a senior federal regulatory official at that time who held a Ph.D. in physics summarized this “uncomfortable reality” in numerous internal memos. He duly sent them to other A.E.C. officials often lawyers and political appointees—not scientists—who then filed them away.

Often nuclear plants were designed by firms that had never done the job before and operated by utility companies that had little experience in doing much beyond burning coal and stringing transmission wires. Shrewdly the industry sought to protect itself from the risks it might be imposing on others: it refused to consider building large numbers of plants until 1957 when Congress passed the Price-Anderson Act which effectively granted it blanket protection from paying the full cost of potential liabilities should accidents occur. To make matters even dodgier the emerging nuclear industry operated under a loose regulatory framework. The A.E.C. issued little more than “General Design Criteria” for the industry to follow. The edition of the criteria published in 1965 included a pious edict that “heat removal systems” be provided. But the industry received little guidance on the question of how this difficult feat might be engineered; the agency trusted the industry to figure it out and largely rubber-stamped the designs it proposed. All the while the plants themselves were getting jaw-droppingly big. The first nuclear reactor built in 1942 beneath a football stadium at the University of Chicago had barely been able to power a light bulb—but now the government wanted reactor complexes that could power all of Chicago. As one A.E.C. chairman put it nuclear power was being transformed in just twenty years from the Wright brothers’ Kitty Hawk flyer into a Boeing 747. Depending on your point of view this rambunctious approach was either a laudable alternative to incremental technological advancement or imprudent expensive and reckless.

Although government experts couldn’t nail down the probability of an accident they could use straightforward arithmetic to predict the damage that might result. The results were presented in a 1957 study by the A.E.C.’s Brookhaven National Laboratory. The study which drew on research on the impact of ionizing radiation conducted after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki indicated that a worst-case scenario for a major accident at what was then considered a large nuclear plant could cause thirty-four hundred deaths and seven billion dollars in property damage—about seventy-four billion dollars in today’s money. Eight years later in 1965 Brookhaven updated its analysis of a worst-case scenario. Nuclear plants had grown in scale and the implications were devastating: a meltdown could cause forty-five thousand deaths with radioactive contamination creating a potential “area of disaster the size of the State of Pennsylvania.” When the 1965 update landed at A.E.C. headquarters Wellock writes “The commission opted to suppress the results. For the next eight years the draft update sat like a tumor in remission in A.E.C. filing cabinets waiting to metastasize.” It was made available only in 1973 after the Chicago attorney Myron Cherry demanded its release.

In the gallows humor of the nuclear-engineering community the kind of mishap that could lead to catastrophe was referred to as the China Syndrome: the idea was that a major malfunction could cause a white-hot blob of molten uranium to form and that this blob would begin to sink into the earth heading in the general direction of China. According to Wellock such a scenario became an obsession for the government starting in the late sixties—posing as it did a public-relations problem that could kill the nuclear-power program especially given the rise of the environmental movement. James Schlesinger an economist appointed by President Richard Nixon as the A.E.C. chairman in 1971 worried that the agency—which was then being challenged about the scientific basis of its nuclear-safety claims—lacked satisfactory answers and he supported a major inquiry into accident probability. But the study which was finished in 1975 didn’t put the safety question to rest and for its critics its shortcomings underscored how much the government didn’t know. The N.R.C. was later forced to repudiate its widely publicized findings. According to notes taken by an agency staffer named Thomas Murley and obtained by Wellock there was a debate about letting “the chips fall where they may”—that is releasing whatever results the experts reported. Schlesinger and others urged caution; at one early point he advised staffers working on the report to “keep all references to death injuries or property damage in the vaguest possible terms.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

And not just any glass but Gorilla Glass. This chemically-strengthened glass was created by Corning and has since become a staple of the smartphone market. Let's look at a bit of history first before getting to the smartphone era.

Corning got its start in the mid-19th century and made lenses for railroad signal lights and later car headlights. It made the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. In 1915 it created Pyrex cookware. Then in the 1960s it started making windows for NASA spacecraft including the space shuttle. Fast forward to 2006 and we get to the fateful meeting between Apple and Corning.



Corning has manufactured some of the most important pieces of glass in history

Plastic screens were the norm in that era but Apple cares too much about aesthetics to let a device get scratched up. More than that the iPhone was a touchscreen-based phone the screen was its everything and it had to be protected.

That was true of other smartphones too as they transition from keypads and keyboards to touchscreens. The early iPhones used Gorilla Glass and so did the T-Mobile G1 the first ever Android phone.

Touch phones running just about every OS on earth adopted Corning's glass as well. From the tiny Samsung Corby to the i8910 Omnia HD powerhouse. From the stylish LG KM900 Arena to the unique LG BL40 New Chocolate.

It was also on the Nokia X6 (now that the Finns were moving away from resistive touch) as well as the Motorola Droid/Milestone the rugged Sonim XP3.20 Quest and even the LG GD910 watch phone (we will talk about wearables later). And these are just some of the phones from 2009.

By 2010 around 20% of mobile phones featured Gorilla Glass some 200 million devices. In 2012 the sequel was announced - sheets of Gorilla Glass 2 could be 20% thinner while staying just as tough.

GG2 was used by the likes of the Galaxy S III and the camera-turned-phone Galaxy Camera GC100. Samsung also used it on its Windows Phone handset the Ativ S as did HTC on the creatively named Windows Phone 8X.

By now Nokia had become a fan of the glass and it featured on the Lumia 920. Other influential phones to use GG2 include the Oppo Find 5 and the LG Optimus G. The glass was even suitable for 3D displays as seen on the Optimus 3D Max.

Gorilla Glass 3 arrived in 2013 a completely new formulation. It was more resistant to scratches and the scratches it did receive were less visible thanks to something Corning called ""Native Damage Resistance"".

To demonstrate it at the MWC Corning dropped a 135g steel ball on a normal piece of glass and GG3. The normal glass cracked so it was replaced by a sheet of aluminum. Dropping the ball again left a dent in the aluminum but Gorilla Glass 3 survived unscathed.

The sequels to some familiar faces used GG3. The Galaxy S4 Note3 and S4 zoom from Samsung for example. The affordable Moto G its premium sibling Moto X (both made by Google-owned Motorola) and the LG Nexus 5.

There was also the Nokia Lumia 1020 and the sizable Lumia 1320 with its 6"" screen (remember that this was back in the 16:9 days this thing was 85.9mm wide and 164.2mm tall).

Gorilla Glass 3 was one of the most successful formulations for Corning and it still sees use to this day here are a few modern devices. The Pixel 6a uses it for its display. The Asus ROG Phone 6 Pro uses it for its back. Interestingly the Motorola Edge 30 Pro uses GG3 for the front and GG5 for the back. It is still used by a rugged Sonim phone and the Ulefone Power Armor 14 Pro.

We haven't mentioned Apple in a while what happened? With the iPhone 5 in 2012 the company stopped using the trademarked ""Gorilla Glass"" name and started calling it ""ion-strengthened glass"" instead. It was still a Corning product however.

Cupertino actually tried switching away from glass around this point. It was working with GT Advanced a company that made sapphire crystal screens for the Apple Watch. Those were also used to protect the camera and Touch ID fingerprint readers. But Apple wanted bigger sheets ones that could cover the display of iPhones. Unfortunately the GT Advanced went bankrupt while trying to develop the technology to make it possible. Sapphire Crystal has been used on some phones but none that have the sales volume of iPhones. It is mostly a watch thing.

This is a good segue into Gorilla Glass SR+ a glass from 2016 designed specifically designed for wearables. It offered better damage resistance and reduced screen reflections compared to ""alternative luxury cover materials"".



Corning formulated Gorilla Glass SR+ and DX/DX+ for wearables

Then in 2018 came Gorilla Glass DX and DX+ improved glass for wearables. According to Corning it reduced reflections by 75% which improved screen contrast by 50%. This was vital for smartwatches which only had tiny batteries to power their displays. The difference between the DX and DX+ was that the plus model was harder.

A few years later Corning reintroduced Gorilla Glass DX and DX+ as protection for camera lenses. The scratch resistance and improved optical performance is just as important for cameras as it is for watches. DX and DX+ let 98% of light pass through while reducing reflections (which can cause glare in photos).

The latest formulations from Corning are Gorilla Glass Victus and Victus+ (it stopped with the number versions after 6). Based on official tests a smartphone with Victus glass on the front can survive a fall from 2m (6.5ft) onto concrete and still have a functioning display. It also boasted superior scratch resistance compared to previous generations.

Victus and Victus+ are now the norm for flagships - the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Asus Zenfone 9 Google Pixel 6 Pro Xiaomi 12S Ultra Sony Xperia 1 IV the Galaxy Xcover 6 Pro OnePlus 10 Pro Oppo Find X5 Pro and many others.

Sony Xperia 1 IV • Samsung Galaxy Xcover6 Pro • OnePlus 10 Pro • Oppo Find X5 Pro

Corning has also made Gorilla Glass for tablets and even laptops. The company has a long history of making glass for larger displays like TVs too (though that doesn't get marketed under the ""Gorilla Glass"" name).

Corning's next challenge is foldable phones - some use ""Ultra Thin Glass"" (UTG) which measures one third the thickness of a human hair. It's so thin that it can bend not something you see glass do normally. But making it durable enough for hundreds of daily fold and unfold cycles is no easy feat. Still it's an important problem to solve as foldables are seen as the future of smartphones by some.



A sheet of foldable glass developed by Corning

By 2020 Corning’s Gorilla Glass has been featured on 8 billion devices created by over 45 OEMs. It has been a wild success considering that the original GG was put together in a hurry developed in just 4 months. It has gone through many iterations and improvements and the reason it was needed in the first place has not gone away.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbm5lc3NlYW4uY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvdGVuMjM1MjE30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvin Patrick Risen Obituary,"Loving husband doting father adoring son globe-trotting businessman and keen fan of the George Tech Yellow Jackets – died on Aug. 11 in Blacksburg Va. He was 78. Marvin known to friends and colleagues as Pat was born on April 3 1944 in Nashville Tenn. the son of Marvin Jordan Risen and Mary Emily (Rice) Risen. His father a field agent for the F.B.I. died before he was born and a few years later his mother married another agent Francis Norwood who raised Pat as his son. Pat graduated from Montgomery Bell Academy in 1962 and studied mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech where he lettered in gymnastics. After graduating in 1966 he served for two years in the U.S. Army primarily at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland and the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant in Illinois. After receiving an honorable discharge he moved to Washington D.C. where he studied at the American University receiving his masters degree in business administration in May 1972. Three months later he married Elizabeth (Chickering) Risen and the two moved to Corning N.Y. where Pat began his long career in international business and where both of his sons were born. His background in engineering and business made him a valuable part of Corning Inc.’s global sales team and his work took him around the world from Marseilles to Singapore. He and his family even spent 18 months living in Tokyo an experience that left Pat with a love for all things Japanese. In 1985 the Risens moved back to Pat’s hometown where he worked for Alcoa Fujikura Ltd.

Neither of the occupants from the big rig were injured in the deadly collision which happened along SR-299E just west of Pit No. 1 Powerhouse Road near Fall River Mills according to officials.

California Highway Patrol has since reported that officials were dispatched to the scene of the crash around 5:50 a.m. after receiving reports of a head-on collision involving a passenger vehicle and tractor-trailer with the passenger vehicle and its’ driver trapped under the big rig.

Responding officials found a red 2008 Chevy Cobalt that had crashed head-on into a red 2014 Peterbilt towing an unloaded flat-bed trailer both of which sustained significant damage in the collision and later had to be towed from the scene.

Officials immediately began a cut and rescue operation to free the critically injured driver of the Chevy; however despite life-saving efforts the woman succumbed to her injuries and passed away.

According to CHP the driver killed in the collision since identified by family and friends as Maria “Ria” Riggins was traveling westbound on the highway and was coming down a steep grade just west of Fall River Mills when for an unknown reason she crossed over the double-yellow lines and plowed head-on into the Peterbuilt.

CHP has since said the Chevy had been going around 55 to 60 mph and that the Peterbuilt had been traveling eastbound up the grade around 45 mph when the collision occurred.

CHP says their preliminary on-scene investigation revealed that neither alcohol nor drug intoxication were contributing factors in the crash and added that the victim killed in the collision had not been wearing a seat belt when the deadly accident occurred.

Neither the driver of the big rig Jose Ramirez 25 of Corning or his passenger Vincent Ramirez 50 also of Corning were injured in the crash and both were continuing to cooperate with CHP’s investigation which is active and ongoing.

The brightness of the Nothing Phone 1 is allegedly not as high as the firm was informed according to a report. Let’s continue with the explanation of the situation. Actually the UK company’s first smartphone the Nothing Phone 1 which was introduced to the world last month is a smartphone. The phone will have a 6.55-inch full-HD+ OLED display with a maximum brightness of 1200 nits the company said during the introduction. A recent source however asserts that the phone can only produce brightness up to 700 nits at the moment. According to the article Nothing will release an upgrade in the future that will enable the increased brightness range. Nothing Phone 1’s display is HDR 10+ compatible and protected by Corning Gorilla Glass.

These details were revealed in the report. Nothing has changed on the website according to the complaint and the peak brightness has decreased. The German journal conducted a test in July and the results showed that the highest rating would never go above 700 nits. According to reports the testing was carried out using HDR videos and average picture quality. Nothing in the article was cited as “About 700 nits is the brightness peak value. The business will change this going forward.”

In a follow-up interview Nothing stated to Computerbase that it intends to release a software upgrade in the future that will raise the brightness of the Phone 1’s display to 1200. This choice was made to guarantee a balanced user experience in terms of battery and heat usage.

Price and specifications:

The Nothing Phone 1 was released last month and the entry-level 8GB RAM + 128GB storage model costs Rs 32999 in India. A 50-megapixel dual-camera configuration a 16-megapixel selfie sensor and up to 256GB of UFS 3.1 internal storage are among the features of the Nothing Phone 1 specifications. The Snapdragon 778G+ processor and up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM power the phone. With a 4500mAh battery the Nothing Phone 1 is capable of 33W cable charging 15W Qi wireless charging and 5W reverse charging.

Now more and more the clock is watching them.

“You’re supposed to be a trusted member of your team but there was never any trust that you were working for the team” she said.

But her first paychecks seemed low. Her new employer which used extensive monitoring software on its all-remote workers paid them only for the minutes when the system detected active work. Worse Ms. Kraemer noticed that the software did not come close to capturing her labor. Offline work — doing math problems on paper reading printouts thinking — didn’t register and required approval as “manual time.” In managing the organization’s finances Ms. Kraemer oversaw more than a dozen people but mentoring them didn’t always leave a digital impression. If she forgot to turn on her time tracker she had to appeal to be paid at all.

A few years ago  Carol Kraemer a longtime finance executive took a new job. Her title senior vice president was impressive. The compensation was excellent: $200 an hour.

But in-person workplaces have embraced the tools as well. Tommy Weir whose company Enaible provides group productivity scores to Fortune 500 companies aims to eventually use individual scores to calibrate pay. “The real question” he said “is which companies are going to use it and when and which companies are going to become irrelevant?”

Some employers are making a trade: “If we’re going to give up on bringing people back to the office we’re not going to give up on managing productivity” said Paul Wartenberg who installs monitoring systems for clients including accounting firms and hospitals.

Tracking they say allows them to manage with newfound clarity fairness and insight. Derelict workers can be rooted out. Industrious ones can be rewarded. “It’s a way to really just focus on the results” rather than impressions said Marisa Goldenberg who ran a division of the company Ms. Kraemer joined and said she used the tools in moderation.

But many employers along with makers of the tracking technology say that even if the details need refining the practice has become valuable — and perhaps inevitable.

As these practices have spread so has resistance to what labor advocates call one of the most significant expansions of employer power in generations. TikTok videos offer tips on outsmarting the systems including with a “mouse jiggler” a device that creates the appearance of activity. (One popular model is called Liberty.) Some of the most closely monitored employees in the country have become some of the most restive — warehouse workers attempting to unionize truckers forming protest convoys.

But two years ago her employer started requiring chaplains to accrue more of what it called “productivity points.” A visit to the dying: as little as one point. Participating in a funeral: one and three-quarters points. A phone call to grieving relatives: one-quarter point.

Each morning Ms. Richardson and her colleagues had to project how many “productivity points” they would accumulate during the day’s work. But death defied planning .

Allina Health The Rev. Margo Richardson Hospice chaplain Each morning Ms. Richardson and her colleagues had to project how many “productivity points” they would accumulate during the day’s work. But death defied planning . Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times

The metrics are even applied to spiritual care for the dying. The Rev. Margo Richardson of Minneapolis became a hospice chaplain to help patients wrestle with deep searching questions. “This is the big test for everyone: How am I going to face my own death?” she said.

“We’re in this era of measurement but we don’t know what we should be measuring” said Ryan Fuller former vice president for workplace intelligence at Microsoft.

UnitedHealth social workers were marked idle for lack of keyboard activity while counseling patients in drug treatment facilities according to a former supervisor. Grocery cashiers said the pressure to quickly scan items degraded customer service making it harder to be patient with elderly shoppers who move slowly. Ms. Kraemer the executive said she sometimes resorted to doing “busywork that is mindless” to accumulate clicks.

But the most urgent complaint spanning industries and incomes is that the working world’s new clocks are just wrong: inept at capturing offline activity unreliable at assessing hard-to-quantify tasks and prone to undermining the work itself.

Ms. Polney’s keyboard activity was closely monitored when she worked for a division of UnitedHealth Group. She sometimes accrued “idle time” while discussing cases with colleagues affecting her chances of getting bonuses and promotions.

Architects academic administrators doctors nursing home workers and lawyers described growing electronic surveillance over every minute of their workday. They echoed complaints that employees in many lower-paid positions have voiced for years: that their jobs are relentless that they don’t have control — and in some cases that they don’t even have enough time to use the bathroom. In interviews and in hundreds of written submissions to The Times white-collar workers described being tracked as “demoralizing” “humiliating” and “toxic.” Micromanagement is becoming standard they said.

Some radiologists see scoreboards showing their “inactivity” time and how their productivity stacks up against their colleagues’. At companies including J.P. Morgan tracking how employees spend their days from making phone calls to composing emails has become routine practice. In Britain Barclays Bank scrapped prodding messages to workers like “Not enough time in the Zone yesterday” after they caused an uproar. At UnitedHealth Group low keyboard activity can affect compensation and sap bonuses. Public servants are tracked too: In June New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority told engineers and other employees they could work remotely one day a week if they agreed to full-time productivity monitoring.

Now digital productivity monitoring is also spreading among white-collar jobs and roles that require graduate degrees. Many employees whether working remotely or in person are subject to trackers scores “idle” buttons or just quiet constantly accumulating records. Pauses can lead to penalties from lost pay to lost jobs.

In lower-paying jobs  the monitoring is already ubiquitous: not just at Amazon  where the second-by-second measurements became notorious but also for Kroger cashiers UPS drivers and millions of others. Eight of the 10 largest private U.S. employers track the productivity metrics of individual workers many in real time according to an examination by The New York Times.

Ms. Kraemer the finance executive thought she had seen it all. Years after working at Enron the energy giant turned business blowup she and former colleagues still held reunions to commemorate what they had been through. But she had never encountered anything like the practices of ESW Capital a Texas-based group of business software companies.

She and her co-workers could turn off their trackers and take breaks anytime as long as they hit 40 hours a week which the company logged in 10-minute chunks. During each of those intervals at some moment they could never anticipate cameras snapped shots of their faces and screens creating timecards to verify whether they were working. Some bosses allowed a few “bad” timecards — showing interruptions or no digital activity — according to interviews with two dozen current and former employees. Beyond that any snapshot in which they had paused or momentarily stepped away could cost them 10 minutes of pay. Sometimes those cards were rejected; sometimes the workers knowing the rules didn’t submit them at all.

While the tracker was on “you couldn’t choose those bathroom or coffee moments — you just had to wing it” she said.

Though Ms. Kraemer didn’t know it that software had been created with a sense of promise about the future of the workplace.

It was part of a bold plan for streamlining and “redefining the way people work” as one of the creators put it. Office settings were choked with unnecessary interruptions they believed and constrained by geography from hiring the best talent worldwide. Smartphones and their constant pings were a growing threat to concentration.

If technology could optimize productivity everyone would benefit the executives said. The company would accomplish more. Workers would perform better then log off to live their lives.

To carry out this vision ESW deployed a firm called Crossover founded in 2014 to hire and manage workers. Wages were high and benefits sparse: Nearly everyone would be contractors using their own computers. The executives adapted an existing tracker into WorkSmart the software that placed Ms. Kraemer and others under a dome of electronic supervision.

The system drew adherents because the productivity gains were remarkable. Goofing off was excised. In interviews former supervisors described having newfound powers of near X-ray vision into what employees were doing other than working: watching porn playing video games using bots to mimic typing two-timing Crossover by programming for other businesses and subcontracting their assignments out to lower-paid workers.

Other employees they said became more efficient. “Once you see those metrics those insights something changes: You realize how much you waste doing nothing or just multitasking and not accomplishing stuff” said Federico Mazzoli a co-creator of WorkSmart. Some overseas workers said the intrusions were worth the U.S. salaries that enabled them to buy homes or start businesses.

Crossover Federico Mazzoli Product Manager Mr. Mazzoli helped create software used to monitor white-collar workers and pay them only for the minutes they were actively working. He later questioned the accuracy of his creation and called it dangerous. Tali Kimelman for The New York Times

But Ms. Kraemer like many of her colleagues found that WorkSmart upended ideas she had taken for granted: that she would have more freedom in her home than at an office; that her M.B.A. and experience had earned her more say over her time.

Workdays grew longer for her and others in part because offline work didn’t count but also because it was nearly impossible to work online with unwavering focus. Taking time to mull or bantering with colleagues turned out to be necessary to both doing her job and getting through the day even if those moments went unpaid.

“You have to be in front of your computer in work mode 55 or 60 hours just to get those 40 hours counted and paid for” Ms. Kraemer said. Though WorkSmart allowed payment requests for offline work employees said managers did not always encourage them. (Executives from ESW and Crossover did not reply to repeated requests for comment including written questions about whether any of these practices have since been updated. But Crossover defends its practices on its website saying that its “‘Fitbit’ of productivity” spurs motivation accountability and “remote freedoms.”)

Two years after helping to build WorkSmart Mr. Mazzoli started using it. He became awash in anxiety and doubtful about its accuracy. “Some days you were just moving the cursor around just for the sake of it” he said. The tool was powerful but dangerous he concluded. (He left the company a year later.)

Crossover’s reputation as an employer began to slide with online reviews that warned against working there. The company heard so many complaints about the camera trained on each worker that they removed it as a default feature according to Mr. Mazzoli. Ms. Kraemer left ESW and sued Crossover for unpaid wages for work that its system didn’t track. The case was settled for an amount she is barred from disclosing.

But WorkSmart’s creators had adopted an idea that was going mainstream. Human resources once reliant on more subjective assessments was becoming more of an analytics business. Employers had always sought to get the most out of employees and some fields had long recorded billable client hours but this was different. “The people data revolution predicted for years has finally arrived” proclaimed a 2018 Deloitte report.

Software makers competed to deliver employee ratings app-activity reports and color-coded charts showing who was doing what. Even software that wasn’t designed for productivity surveillance contributed to it. Microsoft Teams introduced in 2017 and taken up by hundreds of millions of people signaled which users were “active” (green dot) or “away” (yellow). Salesforce the leading marketing sales and customer service program logged emails sent and phone calls made to customers. At financial firms monitoring software set up for compliance reasons also served up insights on how employees spent their time.

Upwork a freelance marketplace now used by podcast producers accountants and hundreds of thousands of other skilled workers offered a time-tracking feature similar to WorkSmart’s that took screenshots during every 10-minute billing window. (This is no coincidence: The tracker that inspired WorkSmart is now part of Upwork.) Freelancers could try to explain screenshots showing moments of inactivity but as with WorkSmart some said they submitted only the unblemished ones in effect forgoing pay for some of their labor.

Union Test Prep Dora Potts Editor in Chief Ms. Potts said she was in favor of the screenshots that Upwork a freelancer marketplace took at random intervals during her work for a testing preparation service. “It keeps you honest” she said. Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times

The arrival of the pandemic spurring businesses to keep tabs on workers at home hastened a shift that was already underway. As more employers adopted the tools more workers shared Ms. Kraemer’s experience: The software was warping the foundations of time and trust in their work lives.

In the spring of 2020 Patrick Baratta graduated from the University of Virginia and began working remotely for AlphaBrook which provides research on government contracting. Soon the company began gauging its workers’ productivity using a program called Monitask according to Mr. Baratta and several former colleagues.

Once he said a manager asked why his score had dropped during a particular 10-minute increment. “Sometimes I have to use the bathroom” he replied. (Matthew Hastings AlphaBrook’s founder and chief executive said the company “would never assess an employee over just 10 minutes of their time.”) In interviews and written submissions to The Times workers across a variety of jobs — pharmaceutical assistants insurance underwriters employees of e-commerce companies — also said productivity pressure had led to problems with bathroom breaks.

Some companies that adopted monitoring tools during the Covid-19 shutdown maintained them even after returning to work in person. CoStar Group a Washington-based real estate data company where a friend of Mr. Baratta took a job continued keeping intricate records of how employees spend their time. (One report viewed by The Times had over 20 entries in a single hour of an employee’s day.) CoStar said that those numbers were not used as stand-alone tools and that a better measurement was the monthly rankings of individual employee output displayed on screens in the office.

Larger more established companies are taking similar steps. UnitedHealth Group has 350000 employees a perch high on the Fortune 500 list and annual revenues of hundreds of billions of dollars. It also has strict systems for measuring “idle time” that some employees say are deeply flawed.

Jessica Hornig a Rhode Island social worker who supervised two dozen other UnitedHealthcare social workers and therapists seeing patients with drug addiction and other serious problems said their laptops marked them “idle” when they ceased keyboard activity for more than a short while. They were labeled derelict during sensitive conversations with patients and visits to drug treatment facilities.

“This literally killed morale” Ms. Hornig said. “I found myself really struggling to explain to all my team members master’s-level clinicians why we were counting their keystrokes.”

In recent years she said the scores have become even more consequential: On performance evaluations social workers were rated 1 to 5 based on the amount of time they were digitally engaged — numbers that affected compensation. Ms. Hornig said her team spent hours each week piecing together alternate records but had trouble keeping up without compromising core parts of their job.

Other UnitedHealth employees described similar problems. For Linda Eusebi who works on insurance letters from her home in Garden Grove Calif. compensation is tied to “idle time.” At the end of the workday when her company-issued computer is shutting down it sometimes gets stuck in “idle” mode all night throwing off her numbers. (She said her managers aware of the problems but unable to fix them began reminding her and others to jiggle their mice during meetings and training sessions.)

Isaac Sorensen a spokesman for Optum a division of UnitedHealth Group acknowledged that the company monitored employees but declined to say how many and said it considered several factors in evaluations. “We know there is no single measure to fully assess team productivity or individual performance” he said.

For frustrated employees or for companies navigating what to disclose to workers or how to deploy metrics in pay or firing decisions the law provides little guidance. In many states employers have “carte blanche in how to implement these technologies to surveil workers” said Ifeoma Ajunwa a law professor at the University of North Carolina.

Many of today’s workplace regulations including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 were written long before “bottom performer” dashboard displays were conceivable. A New York law that took effect this spring requires employers to disclose the type of information they collect. But efforts to enact a similar rule in California stalled amid opposition from business groups.

“The technology is just growing and improving so quickly” said Brian Kropp the chief of research for Gartner’s human resources practice. “It’s moving faster than employees realize it is and a whole lot faster than government can regulate it.” Investment in new workplace technologies has been soaring according to Jason Corsello a venture capitalist who called “performance management” one of the fastest-growing categories with an eightfold increase in funding in the last five years.

But the march toward ever-tighter monitoring is also encountering some limits. Some companies have rejected the approach outright and earlier this year Amazon quietly eased back on the best-known and most criticized productivity metric in the American workplace.

For years Amazon’s “time off task” policy recorded warehouse workers’ every pause and resulted in the firing of highly praised employees after one bad day. With unionization efforts underway on Staten Island and new California regulations on warehouse metrics Amazon reformulated its rules. The company still calculates every worker’s “rate” or pace. But the term “time off task” has been retired according to Kelly Nantel a spokeswoman and managers have been directed to look only into “idle” periods longer than 15 minutes. The updated rules she said are meant to recognize that employees may need to confer with a colleague or spend a few extra minutes in the restroom — in other words to better reflect people’s natural behavior and cadences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC91cy9ndW4tdmlvbGVuY2UtYXJjaGl2ZS1wcm9maWxlL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUJodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzA4LzE0L3VzL2d1bi12aW9sZW5jZS1hcmNoaXZlLXByb2ZpbGU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a tiny nonprofit with no full-time employees became the foremost tracker of gun violence in America,"CNN —

In the Supreme Court decision overturning a New York gun law the three liberal justices opened their dissent by citing data from two of the leading researchers of gun violence in America.

The first was the CDC. The second was the Gun Violence Archive.

“Since the start of this year (2022) there have been 277 reported mass shootings — an average of more than one per day. See Gun Violence Archive” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in June in the opening paragraph.

The dissent was just the latest example of the growing influence of the Gun Violence Archive a tiny nonprofit that has for less than a decade attempted to log every single incident of gun violence in the US in real time. The organization has been cited by the Supreme Court policymakers and media outlets like CNN primarily for its ongoing tally of mass shootings which it defines as any incident in which four people are shot excluding the shooter.

That increasing visibility is a sign of success for Mark Bryant the executive director of the Gun Violence Archive. He told CNN he started noticing the phrase “according to Gun Violence Archive” in news articles and Google searches a few years ago and sees it as a positive.

“We realize that we are making a difference. We’re making the conversation consistent” he said. “If they’re using ‘according to Gun Violence Archive’ they’re using consistent vetted data and that legitimizes their story as much as it does us.”

Yet for all its influence in providing that data the Gun Violence Archive is remarkably small-scale. The organization is funded almost entirely by a single octogenarian donor has no office space or any full-time employees and is led by a bushy-bearded Kentucky gun owner who sold several of his firearms to help launch the group.

That this bare-bones organization informs the highest levels of power underscores the startling lack of timely standardized data on American gun violence. The FBI collects data on aggravated assaults and murders and the CDC collects data on total deaths from firearms. Yet both release that information months if not years after the fact making it difficult to understand new trends or determine the impact of legislation or policies.

“Imagine trying to understand baseball where you’re only collecting some stats and you’re publishing them nine months after the season ended” explained Jeff Asher a gun violence researcher and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics. “It’s an absurdity that we don’t collect better systemic data there.”

The Gun Violence Archive’s recent prominence comes after three horrific mass shootings in the past few months: the racist attack on Black people in a New York supermarket the slaughter of little kids at a Texas elementary school and the killing of 4th of July parade-goers in Illinois.

In late June President Joe Biden signed into law major gun safety legislation with bipartisan support the most significant law addressing gun violence in nearly three decades. In a speech pushing for that legislation Biden noted that there had been 20 mass shootings in the week after the Uvalde Texas school shooting – data likely pulled straight from the Gun Violence Archive.

“Everybody needs a consistent set of information and until the government can come up with near real-time very granular data we’re it” Bryant said. “So I see no reason for us to stop.”

A provocation turns into a dataset

The Gun Violence Archive grew out of an interactive project by Slate magazine that was launched as a provocation.

In the wake of the December 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school Slate’s senior editor of culture at the time Dan Kois wanted to do something that would force people to confront the scope of America’s gun violence he told CNN. He was angry about the shooting and became further frustrated when he tried to look up real-time gun violence data and found only outdated information from the CDC.

“It seemed surprising to me that there was no central location where anyone was keeping track of gun violence as it happened” Kois said.

The CDC’s death data is based on death certificates certified at the state level and the timeliness of those certificates varies from state to state said Jeff Lancashire a spokesman for the National Center for Health Statistics a unit of the CDC. In addition the Justice Department’s collection of firearm death data from crime reports requires an investigative process which takes a long time he said.

To fill the void Kois and Slate’s interactives lead Chris Kirk teamed up and launched a project attempting to track all gun violence in the US a couple weeks after Sandy Hook. But their data was haphazard and incomplete largely relying on an anonymous Twitter account called @gundeaths that tweeted local news stories of gun violence. And updating the database rapidly became “overwhelming” for the duo Kois said.

Still the project garnered media attention and a handful of committed volunteers reached out to try to fill in the gaps in the data. Bryant was one of those volunteers.

A 67-year-old with a Santa beard Bryant has spent his career in systems architecture or building and designing computer systems to make data accessible and useful primarily at IBM. A native of Kentucky he also has a personal comfort with guns. He learned to fire a rifle at about 5 or 6 years old by shooting at rats at the garbage dump and he has continued target shooting as a hobby as an adult.

In November 2012 when a blood clot sent him to the ICU for over a week he decided to make a career change. After recovering he came across the Slate gun violence interactive and began “bugging them” that they had missed certain shootings in their database he said. He bothered them so much that they eventually turned over their passwords to him so he could update the project himself.

“One thing I remember from those days is that Mark was really rigorous about the data” said Kois the Slate editor. “Every time there were problems or discrepancies with our data it drove him crazy. It also drove us crazy but it drove him crazier.”

Slate looked about for someone to fund the project on a more permanent basis and found Mike Klein.

Klein 80 had co-founded the real estate and IT company CoStar Group in 1987 and he has used that wealth to fund initiatives focused on transparency and real time access to information. In 2005 he co-founded the Sunlight Foundation a nonprofit group that uses data and technology to make government work more transparent. The organization closed in 2020 and its work and staff were moved to the Internet Archive and the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard.

“I have a fundamental interest in and commitment to utilizing information to make intelligent decisions” Klein explained.

In spring of 2013 Klein offered up his own money to bankroll the gun violence data project independently and take it out of Slate’s overwhelmed hands. He and Bryant connected and they agreed to use Klein’s funding and Bryant’s data expertise to create the Gun Violence Archive.

Bryant also put his gun collection toward the effort. He sold several Colt Python revolvers for about $3000 to $3500 each and put that money toward paying the starting staff.

“I like the balance of that” he said. “It paid for operating expenses for me and the four other people that were starting with us. That was the start.”

After Slate’s one-year experiment ended the Gun Violence Archive launched with its own website on January 1 2014.

How the Gun Violence Archive works

For all its data background the Gun Violence Archive’s work is at its heart basic journalism.

Researchers scrape data automatically from about 7500 law enforcement agencies media outlets and more organizations Bryant said. They then comb through the results double check media sources follow up with police and add that information to the database. Most shootings are added to the system within about 72 hours Bryant said.

About 20 people work under Bryant’s direction but there are no full-time employees; all of the workers are paid as independent contractors Bryant said. They live across the world and come from a variety of backgrounds but over half are librarians he said.

“We have good people that think” he said. “They think about archiving. They think about research. They think about getting the facts right.”

The Gun Violence Archive is set up with the IRS as a 501(c)(3) making it a tax-free nonprofit. Klein said he donated about $250000 per year initially a sum that grew to $500000 per year and is now up to $750000 annually. His contribution makes up about 90% of the group’s budget according to Bryant.

For the fiscal year ending December 2020 the organization’s entire revenue of $650000 was from contributions and it spent about $755000 according to a Form 990 filed with the IRS.

The group has sought to collect data not just on the number of deaths and injuries but on the nature of a shooting: whether it was a domestic incident police-involved unintentional or defensive; where and when it took place; and the age or identity of the victims.

“From the beginning we really focused on making sure that we had a comprehensive view of all the different” types of gun violence Bryant said.

The researchers are trained using a 50-to-60-page manual that defines the group’s methodology in detail. As needed they go back and revise their reporting as new information is released or if they discover they had missed some shootings.

The database is not perfect. Bryant believes their data undercounts non-fatal accidental shootings as well as shootings on Native American reservations likely due to a lack of reporting. Still he said the differences are generally minimal and their end-of-year data holds up well compared to the FBI’s and CDC’s reports.

“If you want to see how many people were killed in Kentucky in 2020 you can go to the CDC or the FBI and you will get a number” he said. “With us you will get a list of every person what their general address was the date the time how many people were shot how many people were arrested etc. etc. So we will provide a level of texture that nobody else has period.”

Asher the gun violence researcher praised the Gun Violence Archive’s work as “one-of-a-kind” and said it was an “amazing” tool for understanding broad trends and year-to-year changes. However he has found that their data is sometimes a little bit off from police incident-level reports making the database difficult to use on a really granular level.

“‘Accurate but not precise’ is a good discussion of them or good way of thinking of them” Asher said. “In times where you don’t need exact precision (it’s a) perfect tool. In times where you do need precision then it’s not inherently the best tool.”

‘We are simply against gun violence’

Klein and Bryant have emphasized from the start that the Gun Violence Archive is non-partisan and non-advocacy.

“We basically didn’t want to undermine our ability to be cited as a source” Klein said. “And I think that’s worked extremely well.”

“We want to convey statistics only” Bryant said “and let other people draw conclusions from those statistics.”

The Gun Violence Archive receives the most skepticism for its broad definition of “mass shooting” as any incident with four or more people shot excluding the shooter. The FBI defines “mass murder” as the murder of four or more people and tracks “active shooter incidents” but there is no federal or agreed-upon definition for a mass shooting.

The Second Amendment Foundation a nonprofit gun rights group has criticized the Gun Violence Archive’s expansive definition of the term as sensational and misleading.

“When most Americans hear the term ‘mass shooting’ they picture a crazed gunman stalking the halls of a school or a shopping mall coldly and randomly executing innocent young victims” the foundation wrote. “What does not come to mind are rival drug crews shooting it out in Chicago or Detroit or a madman murdering his entire family.”

Bryant calls the criticism essentially irrelevant.

“My answer on that is the same number of people are shot whether you call it a ‘mass shooting’ or whether you call it a ‘shooting that four people or more were shot’” Bryant said. “But they just don’t like when the (term) ‘mass shooting’ is used some don’t like that.”

In conversation Bryant used his gun ownership background to push back against criticisms from gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association or the Second Amendment Foundation. He said the Gun Violence Archive is “anti-gun violence” and compared it to the nonprofit group Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

“They’re not against alcohol. They’re not against cars. They’re not against drivers. They are against the combination of drivers driving drunk and causing violence through car wrecks” Bryant said of MADD. “We are not against guns. We are not against gun owners. We are not against any of that. We are simply against gun violence.”

More than eight years after their launch Klein said he was proud of what they had achieved. Given their respective ages he has begun searching around for a permanent funding source as well as a successor to Bryant if and when he retires.

“Mark has achieved the goal which is to have credible online free to anybody source of reliable information about … gun violence” Klein said. “It’s been used to inform discussion and debate and the question is whether or not we can as a country do something with that information that’s useful.”",,,,,,,,,

(WMTV) - The third Costco in the Madison area opens in Verona on Wednesday morning and people in the city are excited about what it could mean for the entire city.

The doors open following an 8:00 a.m. ribbon cutting for the new shop.

“Verona’s the place to be right now” said Verona’s Mayor Luke Diaz. “Most of the business owners I’ve talked to seem to think that bringing more people into Verona is going to help all the businesses in Verona I think Costco is a huge anchor and they are going to bring in a ton of people.”

Costco staff say the new store brings 250 jobs to Verona. Regional marketing manager Kayla Campillo says the chain also gives customers affordable groceries.

“We don’t mark up our items more than 15 percent; we take pride in the fact we want to offer the best possible products at the lowest possible price” said Campillo.

Campillo and Diaz both believe Costco will bring in more customers for every business in Verona.

“Costco really brings that aspect to the community of ‘hey if I wasn’t going to stop to shop in Verona Maybe I will now because there’s a Costco here’ and it really brings business to other places around the area as well” said Campillo.

Diaz adds that the type of jobs Costco supplies adds hiring diversity to the city.

“You know Costco has good-paying jobs that don’t necessarily require a college degree and I think that’s really valuable to have in our community as well” said Diaz.

Costco Gutter Guard Review

Gutter guards are essential for homeowners looking to protect their homes and home foundations with gutter systems and who also want to avoid having to get on a ladder and clean out the gutters several times a year. Costco gutter guards perform better than many other DIY options — especially cheaper ones like foam and brush gutter guards.

In the sections below we’ll include some detailed information about the gutter screens from Costco including how well they work what they cost and how easy they are to install yourself.

Products

Unlike some dedicated home improvement stores like Home Depot and Lowes Costco offers just one brand of gutter guard: EasyOn Gutter Guard. These guards are available in two lengths: 24 feet and 100 feet which is great for customizing your system to your specific home without having to buy large pieces that will go unused.

The gutter guards from Costco are also available in two different widths — five-inch and six-inch — that are designed to fit standard K-style gutter systems. These choices will be suitable for most homes although homeowners with other gutter styles may not be able to install these properly.

The gutter guards from Costco are made of durable stainless steel micro-mesh so they won’t rust or get discolored with exposure to sunlight or moisture and they won’t warp over time. The mesh is fine enough to catch just about any debris that falls or washes onto them including pollen and pine needles and there are thousands of customer reviews to back this up. The stainless steel is also more durable than aluminum gutter guards.

A unique feature of the Costco gutter guards is that they are UL-certified for rainwater harvesting so homeowners who harvest rainwater for non-consumption uses can rest assured that these gutter guards won’t leach harmful chemicals into the water that passes through them.

How Costco Gutter Guards Work

The EasyOn Gutter Guards feature a fine mesh made of stainless steel that allows water to pass through for proper drainage but stops just about all debris from clogging your gutter system. These gutter guards have around 24000 reviews with most customers raving that:

They catch large debris like sticks and pinecones

They prevent small debris like pine needles from entering your rain gutters

They can handle large volumes of water

There is minimal splash-over that reaches your foundation

Of all DIY gutter guard options the EasyOn brand from Costco is among the top-rated options in the industry.

Warranty Coverage

The Costco gutter guards come with a 10-year warranty for equipment which is quite good for a DIY gutter guard option. However you can register your gutter guards after installation to get the extended warranty which is up to a staggering 25 years.

This is the kind of warranty you typically see with professionally installed gutter guards — like LeafFilter and LeafGuard — so it’s outstanding for an affordable DIY option.

It’s important to keep in mind that you must install your gutter guards precisely according to the directions. Any changes or modifications to the gutter guards or signs of improper installation will void your warranty so it’s important that you follow the directions as closely as possible.

It’s also important to remember that the warranty that comes with the EasyOn Gutter Guards is for the equipment only so it only guarantees that you won’t experience product failure or breakage like warping cracking or rusting.

Unlike a professionally installed gutter guard system you won’t get a performance warranty with these guards or the promise that gutter cleaning — if required after installation — will be paid for.

Costco Gutter Guard Installation

DIY gutter guards are a great option for homeowners looking for an affordable solution to clogged gutters but of course they do require some time and effort on your part. The gutter guards from Costco are no exception so you should be prepared to spend some time installing this product.

Generally speaking the installation process is quite easy. The guards are designed to be installed on top of the gutters. The side closest to your roof gets tucked under the first layer of roof shingles (so you won’t void your roof warranty as long as you follow the directions) and the other side attaches to the outer edge of your gutters with the pre-applied tape and/or self-drilling screws.

If you need to bend the gutter guards to fit your gutters the side closest to your roof can be attached to the fascia.

Unlike other home improvement stores Costco doesn’t offer the option of professional installation. You could purchase the guards and hire a third-party installer but the process is simple enough for most homeowners to do themselves.

Lastly it’s important to keep in mind that you may need additional equipment to install these gutter guards. Some things you may need include:

A metal-cutting saw

A drill

A sturdy ladder that can reach your gutters

Self-tapping screws (and/or exterior tape or adhesives)

Most DIYers should be able to install these guards in a day or two.

Costco Gutter Guard Cost

Costco’s EasyOn Gutter Guards cost between $2 and $2.50 per linear foot depending on which width you get (5 inches or 6 inches) and the length you buy (it’s available in 24-foot and 100-foot options).

These are a bit more expensive than the DIY gutter guards available from Home Depot and Lowes but they are still far cheaper than professionally-installed gutter guards which can reach up to around $7 per linear foot or more if you also need professional installation.

Availability

Costco is a nationwide company that operates in 46 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico so these gutter guards are available to most homeowners no matter where they live in the U.S.

On the Costco website prices include shipping and handling and descriptions note that the guards may be available for pickup in the warehouse for a lower price. There are additional delivery charges for destinations in Alaska Hawaii and Puerto Rico.

Costco Gutter Guard Reviews

There are about 24000 reviews for EasyOn Gutter Guards on Costco.com which is a testament to their popularity. The guards have nearly a five-star overall rating which speaks to their effectiveness and high value-to-cost ratio.

Some positive things commonly mentioned in the reviews include:

How quickly water can pass through the mesh

How much large and small debris the guards keep out of your gutters

How easy they are to install

How easy they are to return if needed

How seldom they need cleaning

Here’s a video from one reviewer:

One thing in particular that makes it into many of the reviews is how much more efficiently they function than other DIY guards. Many customers have had other DIY gutter guard options clog or cause spillover especially during a downpour.

The reviews for Costco gutter guards suggest that spillover is almost never an issue and some customers have mentioned that they have tested the guards with five-gallon buckets of water and hoses and the results are almost always positive. These guards are commonly recommended by customers for areas that experience heavy or above-average rainfall.

One recurring issue commonly reported with these gutter guards is that they can form ice dams and icicles in the winter in colder climates. Unfortunately this is the case with all types of gutter guards unless you buy heated ones that are suitable for below-freezing weather. EasyOn Gutter Guards have a facility for installing heat cables.

Below we’ll include some of the positive and negative reviews of these gutter guards to give you a sense of what you can expect after you install them.

“Easy install. I used [the] screw-in method. Pieces overlap neatly. Using [a] metal saw I easily cut out about 4 inches of the aluminum sides near one end then tuck the stainless steel mess of that end into the gutter’s end section. Works great despite heavy rain for the past 3-4 weeks. No overflow. It does catch pine needles poking into the mesh so definitely need to use the brush at times. [I ended up replacing a] previous more expensive brand that failed. I like the thin profile of this one as well.” — Nate via Costco.com

“I put them on the section of my roof that is under a white pine and a pin oak. Both these trees are dirty and have given every other gutter guard I have tried a problem. The white pine needles find a way to get stuck in the larger openings and the pin oak drops heavy sticky pollen pods in the spring. The fine stainless steel mesh has kept my gutters in perfect working order with no maintenance for two seasons. Installation is easy and I was finished in under two hours.” — MrBooj via Coscto.com

“I’m a contractor so I asked my gutter guy what is the best gutter guard system and he told me the best he had seen were the ones at Costco. At first [my customer] was very happy with the performance of the system until it came to winter time. I received calls from her that the gutters had icicles hanging from them. Come to find out that the fine mesh allows water to freeze up and block drainage to the gutters.” — Mdpflueger via Costco.com

Final Thoughts & Recommendation

If you’re looking to forego professional installation and prefer to install gutter guards yourself the Costco gutter guards are some of the best options. These guards are a bit more expensive than the ones you’ll find at stores like Home Depot and Lowes but they are super easy to install and come with an outstanding warranty that is extendable for up to 25 years.

Although the warranty doesn’t cover performance or guarantee as some professional installers do that your gutters won’t get clogged most of the customer reviews for this product are overwhelmingly positive.

The majority of homeowners who choose these guards are pleased with the water flow rate into their gutters and how well their gutters and downspouts are protected from all debris from pine needles to large sticks.

Overall we recommend Costco gutter guards if you’re looking for a high-quality gutter guard system that you can install yourself. With a day or two for the installation process and some time dedicated to cleaning the stainless steel mesh one to two times per year the EasyOn Gutter Guards from Costco should serve you and your home quite well saving you money while still offering ample protection from clogged gutters.

But the 151000-square-foot warehouse store — tucked in the northwest corner of The Vineyard shopping complex at Clinton Keith Road and Warm Springs Parkway — has created headaches for others. The store’s opening is central to a major traffic debacle residents say.

Located at 35875 Warm Springs Parkway the new Costco opened Aug. 5 with crowds visible from the Clinton Keith Road exit off the 215 Freeway. The eight-lane 32-pump Costco gas station opened a week earlier on July 29.

“Lines were wrapped all the way around; they had some good deals for that day” said Collin Olsson who attended the grand opening after moving to town this summer. “It’s convenient and so people who live in Murrieta don’t have to travel down to the Temecula Costco.”

But while many Costco fans are excited to not have to drive as far others have said the crowds cause traffic issues. Neighbors and businesses of the shopping complex as well as parents teachers and students at the adjacent Vista Murrieta High School are impacted.

“It took us 45 (minutes) just to get to the high school! Traffic is stupid” wrote Farrah Hawes on Facebook.

Thursday Aug. 11 — the second day of school at Vista Murrieta — was already hectic with a new bell schedule that has students starting and ending school later. The opening of the Costco combined with the addition of thousands of teenagers getting out of school waiting anxiously to be picked up required a response from police officers to help smooth the flow of traffic.

Aside from the main roads students and parents crowded the already-packed shopping center which in addition to Costco includes a Farmer Boys Starbucks Jamba and a Quick Quack Car Wash. An Aldi store and other retailers are also planned for the center according to developer WestMar Commercial Real Estate.

Murrieta spokesperson Dominique Samario said by email that the city has not had any reported major incidents at or around the Costco store since it opened.

Traffic entering the shopping center “has not generated many complaints that our team is aware of” she said.

Costco Wholesale did not respond to multiple requests for comment by late Friday afternoon.

Monica Gutierrez spokesperson for the Murrieta Valley Unified School District said the district “has a great relationship with the city and we partner closely with our police and planning departments to review all large projects that may affect any of our schools.”

The school district has not received any complaints directly related to Costco or the shopping center traffic Gutierrez said.

Murrieta leaders and city officials many of whom were present on Costco’s opening day were proud to report on the store’s success.

“We are very proud to be able to report that Costco confirmed that the Murrieta store opening set the record for the highest sales on a U.S. opening day” said Samario.

Winchester resident Ray Roman said he came to the new store’s opening day bright and early to document the event. He said he believes a Murrieta location was “necessary” and a “good middle ground” for its neighbors.

“I left with the impression that this was going to not only be a busy day but a busy weekend! I warned my family not to go as I shared my experience witnessing the line surrounding practically half of the property” Roman said by email.

The store’s proximity to the freeway seemed likely to bring more traffic to Clinton Keith Roman continued. Traffic seems to get worse after lunchtime through when students leave Visa Murrieta he noted.

Despite traffic and environmental concerns the retailer’s Murrieta location was approved unanimously by the City Council in October 2020. Some residents opposed especially those living in Skyview Ridge a condominium community adjacent to the shopping center.

Stephen Parker who lived on Socorro Street in Skyview Ridge said he sold his house at the end of 2020 not long after the Costco was approved.

“This was a direct result of the potential problems caused to Skyview Ridge” Parker said. “I hate to be the one to say ‘I told you so’ … . The school being now open and the traffic it generates during morning drop-off and afternoon pick-up will be in major conflict with users of the Costco site.”

Vista Murrieta students — and those tasked with picking them up in the nearly 100-degree heat Thursday afternoon — were complaining.

“I was trapped in the line for like 40 minutes — it was bad” said Kyra Singsavaddy who picked up her cousin sophomore Jake Vongsa from the parking lot near the Farmer Boys. “A bunch of parents are trying to cross each way and it gets complicated. It was my turn to go and I almost got hit.”

Singsavaddy who graduated from Vista Murrieta last year said she doesn’t remember traffic being “that crazy” at school before the shopping center and its businesses started opening.

“I live down the street from a Sam’s Club so I didn’t have an issue with the Costco. It’s convenient — but (being) right next to a school it just makes everything harder” Singsavaddy said.

Elsa Gadi waited in the Costco parking lot for nearly a half-hour to pick up her son sophomore Jeremiah Gadi.

“It’s so crazy” Gadi said. “Normally he takes the bus.”"

Her new book is co-authored with her husband businessman Kendall Taylor “No Crown in the Castle""

Fantasia is a multi-talented entertainer. From winning the third season of “American Idol” to concert tours to portraying Celie in Broadway’s “The Color Purple” fans have always embraced Fantasia’s talent. The Grammy-winning singer brings her tour to Wolf Trap in Vienna Va. on Friday August 19. Her opening act is singer Leela James.

Like so many artists the pandemic created space for Fantasia to reflect. Her time for introspection began long before COVID-19 resulting in a refocused Fantasia.

“It was all about me taking control of my career” Fantasia said when speaking about feeling like she was losing her first love which is music. “People see the gifts. You can either find someone to protect the gift or prostitute the gift.”

When Fantasia comes to Wolf Trap she will share her gift of music with her hits and perhaps a few songs from “The Color Purple” movie that she recently wrapped up filming in Georgia. This movie of the Broadway version of the book comes to theaters in 2023. When Fantasia was in the original Broadway production she admitted it took a lot out of her and she was done with the role of Celie. The film features a stellar cast of award-nominated and winning actors that includes Taraji P. Henson Lou Gossett Jr. Coleman Domingo Aunjanue Ellis David Alan Grier Danielle Brooks Corey Hawkins Halle Bailey and H.E.R. For Fantasia there is the difference between the character Celie she played 14 years ago and portraying Celie now. Fantasia hopes young Black women can learn from this latest interpretation of Celie.

“At first I was not going to do it” Fantasia said explaining her hesitation. “There were a lot of things she (Celie) and I relate to. A lot of stuff I let go a long time ago came up.”

One of the most significant changes in Fantasia’s life happened in 2015 with her marriage to businessman Kendall Taylor. Last year the couple welcomed their first child together daughter Keziah joining Fantasia’s children daughter Zion son Dallas and Taylor’s son Treyshaun.

Fantasia and Taylor also birthed the book “No Crown in the Castle: Building a Strong Relationship and a Harmonious Life.” The book shares how the couple built their relationship. They met after Fantasia began working on herself upon finishing her second Broadway show “After Midnight.” She began fasting focusing on loving herself more writing what she wanted in life on index cards then posting them around her New York apartment. Then she met Taylor

“My husband is my best friend. We call each other king and queen” Fantasia said. “We came up with ‘Taylor Talks’ during COVID which turned into 15-second video posts as caregiving for marriages. We were then approached to do a book.”

Whatever it takes singer actress author producer mother and wife Fantasia pulls it all together for a fulfilling life. “No Crown in the Castle: Building a Strong Relationship and a Harmonious Life” by Kendall and Fantasia Taylor is available from your favorite bookseller.

A Macclesfield town centre pub once thought to be destined for permanent closure has undergone a remarkable transformation. The Castle had been closed for over six years and fallen into serious disrepair before reopening last autumn.

Renovation work included the painstaking reconstruction of the pub's ornate ceiling which had partially collapsed due to a leaking roof. A new heating system rebuilt chimney and the creation of a new upper lounge to house more punters complete the works.

The Church Street pub recently won a Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) award in the Historic England Category. Judges were impressed with the sympathetic renovation which maintained the building's original features including the historically significant frontage.

Business owner Rebecca Prunty has grown up in the pub trade including an eight year stint at The Park Tavern across town. She is passionate about traditional pubs and the role they have in their local communities.

Rebecca told CheshireLive: ""I've seen pictures of the pub before the project and parts of the building were in a pretty bad state. We're very happy to receive the CAMRA award but it really belongs to Darren and his team of builders who did the work.

(Image: CAMRA)

""We really wanted to keep that traditional pub look. Darren is a keen history enthusiast. He put a huge amount of effort into those renovations to make sure they were accurate. He redid the ceiling three times to get it spot on.""

""I think it was a massive loss to the community that the pub was closed for so long. We've been so busy since we opened and that shows people wanted to be in here. It's probably a case of absence makes the heart grow fonder.

(Image: CAMRA)

""I could definitely see the potential of the place it was an absolute no-brainer. My heart lies with keeping tradition alive and meeting them with modern service and products. It's a beautiful building in a gorgeous location - and being part of the Castle Quarter surrounded by some of my favourite businesses is fantastic.

""Everyone is welcome at The Castle and if you haven't given us a try yet we'd love to have you. We strive to have something for everyone -and we try to source out product as locally as possible.""

Macclesfield Central councillor Ashley Farrall added: ""I am delighted that another Macclesfield pub has been recognised by CAMRA. Rebecca and her team have worked exceptionally hard to bring the pub back to life and restore it to more than a community pub but a community hub at the heart of the Castle quarter.

""As a free house they buy fantastic independent beers from across the country but also from our very own fantastic local breweries such as Storm Brewing and Redwillow.

""The cost of living crisis puts pressure not only our households but local businesses too. We need to do all we can to help support all our local businesses as much as we can and celebrate their successes.""

""The pub roof needed major attention which had to be done"" explained James. That set in a train a whole series of works which has transformed The Crown into the best it can be.

""Although we adapted to the situation and became a grocery store a takeaway and NHS staff refuge we had to an extent 'got off the bus' as the pub had to close.

""We took the plunge and went ahead with some major improvements - upstairs becoming our four rooms an interior re-design downstairs the existing B&B rooms and garage converted to two self catering cottages plus the front and back garden re-done.

""Nothing went untouched. It really was a case of sink or swim.""

The pub had long had a reputation for excellent food and hospitality and has been firmly rooted in the community it serves - Penny is very much a local country girl having been born into a Dial Post farming family.

The challenge was to retain the excellence around the menu and service and not jeopardise its wonderful intimate charm with the building works.

As its latest award testifies it has achieved that in spades.

The pub supports local Sussex breweries farmers suppliers and producers and James is often out foraging for wild food.

The neighbouring Knepp Castle Estate known for its re-wilding project is a huge inspiration too - especially in the four new guest rooms directly above the pub.

We stayed in Butterfly - an eclectic mix of period and modern styles - which has the countryside at its heart.

The stylish rooms are all individually furnished and they are a million miles away from the templated designs of the large chain hotels.

As well as the rooms above they have the self-catering option as well with two units - one is for a couple and one is for a family.

The outside space is another important factor.

The gardens are a delight and the front overlooks the village green.

As well as welcoming people - their dogs are equally embraced which is particularly important after so many were acquired during lockdown.",,,,,,

Dana Swisher who has worked at Neil Cummins Elementary School in Corte Madera since 2006 was one of 11 school professionals throughout the nation to receive the Presidential Innovation Award for Environmental Educators at a ceremony Aug. 4 in Washington D.C.

Neil Cummins Elementary School is part of the Larkspur-Corte Madera School District.

“This year’s award winners demonstrate how environmental education fosters our future stewards and innovators by connecting them to the soil water and air around us” Martha Guzman a regional administrator for the EPA said in a statement after the awards ceremony.

“There is no better way to build future environmental leaders than by bringing children closer to their land and food” Guzman said.

Swisher 58 of Larkspur is a longtime home gardener and parent of three children who have attended Neil Cummins. As she continued teaching over the years she realized that children needed an experience of the world beyond the classroom and textbooks.

“The garden offers a place for students to be outside and develop an appreciation for the natural world” Swisher said.

Swisher began her overhaul of the school’s “Hawks’ Garden” in earnest during the pandemic. She replanted a swath that had been decimated by gophers with native plants. She installed vegetable fruit and flower plants in large oval metal bins to protect them.

Also she worked with community groups and municipal agencies to launch a native plants border around a portion of Corte Madera Town Park which is adjacent to the garden and shares a fence with the campus.

“She’s made the garden a chronicle of the cycle of things through the seasons” said Larkspur resident and Neil Cummins school parent July Johnson. “She’s bringing it to light for so many kids.”

Johnson nominated Swisher for the 2021 Marin County integrated pest management award. Swisher was one of the recipients of that award. Then Johnson helped Swisher with the application for the EPA award.

Johnson noted that Swisher’s ability to speak Spanish means that she is able to share the joy of gardening across diverse school populations.

“She’s able to work with the English language learner kids and those with disabilities” Johnson said. “They might be normally pretty quiet but they come to life in the garden.”

Swisher said she is glad to have more public recognition about the value of teaching children about native plants such as buckwheat sage and fuchsia.

The value she said is that by integrating the native plants and mixing certain vegetable and flower species together gardeners can curb pests while also attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.

“We’re providing food and forage for birds and other wild creatures all year round” Swisher said.

Swisher said she takes her 25 second-graders into the garden on a regular basis. She also works with other teachers at the K-5 school to help them integrate environmental studies into their class schedules. About 500 children in the school take part in the garden visits.

“The kids often say I feel so much better after spending some time here” Swisher added. “What we’re doing for the garden we’re also doing for ourselves.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3b3MubmluZS5jb20uYXUvbnJsL25ld3MtMjAyMi1yZWZlcmVlLWJlbi1jdW1taW5zLWxpZnRzLWxpZC1vbi1pbmZhbW91cy0yMDE5LWdyYW5kLWZpbmFsLXNpeC1hZ2Fpbi1ibHVuZGVyL2E3NzkxNzM0LTE2NzQtNDIyZC04N2ViLWNiMzEwNDVhZjRhMtIBRGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLm5pbmUuY29tLmF1L2FydGljbGUvYTc3OTE3MzQtMTY3NC00MjJkLTg3ZWItY2IzMTA0NWFmNGEy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Referee Ben Cummins says he felt 'ashamed' 'worthless' after 2019 grand final blunder,"Aug 13th 2022

Aug 13th 2022

Veteran NRL referee Ben Cummins has opened up on his controversial 'Six Again' call that flipped the 2019 grand final saying he felt ""ashamed and worthless"" in the days that followed.

Cummins' call is widely considered to have flipped the match which the Sydney Roosters wound up winning 14-8 against the Canberra Raiders.

The incident occurred in the 71st minute when a Raiders' fifth tackle kick was contested in the air 10m from their try line and bounced backwards off Canberra's kick chaser into skipper Josh Hodgson's path.

Cummins believing the ball had come off Roosters fullback James Tedesco initially called 'Six Again' before changing his call seconds later on the advise of assistant referee Gerard Sutton and the touch judge.

Referee Ben Cummins called six again and changed the call seconds later leaving the Raiders confused. (Nine)

However Wighton did see the changed call and assumed his side had a whole new set to work with before being required to hand over the ball.

Raiders players were left incensed at the call and their feelings were made worse just minutes later when the Roosters scored through Tedesco off the ensuing set in what turned out to be the match-winning play.

Cummins who has refereed in over 400 matches said the enormity of the situation hit him once he left the pitch after the final whistle.

""I walked into the tunnel and the cameras were all on me and I was thinking 'This is not normal. This is big'"" he said. ""I think my heart sunk"".

""I got into the changerooms and Graham Annesley and 'Jacko' (Glenn Jackson from NRL media) were there and they basically said 'This is going to be the back page'.""

Cummins revealed that his teenage daughters were targeted by abusive fans in the wake of the incident admitting he endured some dark days in the aftermath.

""When you sign up to referee at the top level you know that it comes with fans who are passionate and people can say things about your performance"" he explained.

""But when it brings in your family and your home it's sort of to a different level. I found that really hard.

""It was pretty dark times. I didn't want to talk to anyone about it. I had some thoughts about what I wanted to do with my life and they were pretty negative.

Veteran rugby league referee Ben Cummins has opened up about his infamous mistake during the 2019 NRL grand final confessing he went through some “pretty dark times” after the incident.

Scores were tied at 8-8 late in the second half of the decider between the Sydney Roosters and Canberra Raiders when Cummins called “six again” after a Raiders attacking kick came off one of their players.

Canberra five-eighth Jack Wighton grabbed the ball and charged into the defensive line believing it was the first tackle of the set but Cummins reversed his call as the tackle was being made meaning Canberra had to hand over the Steeden.

Moments later Sydney fullback James Tedesco dived over to give the Roosters a 14-8 lead at Sydney Olympic Park.

It was undeniably a major turning point in the contest.

“I realised I stuffed up big time and I tried to correct the call – which would have been the right call” Cummins said.

“But Jack Wighton didn’t see that and he got tackled and the Roosters get the ball and go down the length of the field in the next set and score.

“I realised then that this was big at eight-all in a grand final.

“It doesn’t get much bigger than this.

“I walked into the tunnel and cameras were all on me … my heart sunk.”

Referee mistakes are not uncommon and Cummins inevitably copped a tsunami of abuse from disgruntled rugby league fans for the error; even Hollywood superstar Russell Crowe joined the pile-on.

But the veteran referee who has officiated more than 400 NRL games has also revealed his teenage daughters were targeted after the ordeal.

“When you sign up to referee at the top level you know that it comes with fans who are passionate and people can say things about your performance” he explained.

“But when it brings in your family and your home it’s sort of to a different level. I found that really hard.

“I cant say it was easy for them. My son was copping a lot of abuse at school and my daughters (were) online – because they are on social media. That was really tough.

“I basically locked myself in my house for a week.

“It was pretty dark times. I didn’t want to talk to anyone about it. I had some thoughts about what I wanted to do with my life and they were pretty negative.

“You feel ashamed and worthless embarrassed. I wasn’t sleeping. I just wanted everything to go away.”

Radio presenter Gus Worland founder of mental health charity Gotcha4Life spoke to Channel 9 about the importance of mental strength among Australian men after former Queensland coach Paul Green was found dead in his Brisbane home on Thursday morning the day after his son’s ninth birthday.

The climate emergency is massively impacting Austria’s mountains but a top scientist insists that they will remain flamboyantly colourful.

By Chris Cummins

The Alps that we have defined the much-loved Austrian landscape are changing because of climate change. Most noticeably glaciers are retreating trees are climbing higher up the slopes. We’re also seeing increasing amounts of debris; scattered boulders and eroded slopes. The mudflows and landslides seen last week in Pinzgau in Salzburg province are just one recent example of increasing fragility.

“Due to climatic warming the atmosphere contains more energy and more water vapour and as a consequence the precipitation events grow in intensity” explains Dr Ingo Hartmeyer a scientist at Georesearch. “So over the next years and decades we’ll see an increase in heavy rainfall events. These problems are also related to slope movements from the valley flanks like rockfall events debris flows and mudslides.”

But amid the gloom one aspect of our high mountain landscapes is likely to remain robust and defiantly vibrant says Professor Christian Körner of the University of Basel: the glorious flower meadows that explode in colour high above the treeline.

Chris Cummins

This summer Professor Körner took me high up in the Hohe Tauern National Park to the slopes around the rapidly retreating Schlatenkees glacier. The meadows were blooming with all sorts of alpine flowers. There were blues yellows indigos pinks whites all these flowers courted by fluttering butterflies busy buzzing bees. From the perspective of an aeroplane the high mountains can look barren but up close they are a gloriously flamboyant festival of biodiversity.

“Globally just 2.6% of planet Earth is alpine land and yet we estimate that about 4% of all known plant species occur there” explained Körner. “There is a much greater diversity of plant species that you would expect from the land area although it is considered barren and hostile for plant life.”

Körner explained that the varied topography of the high mountains has helped Alpine plant species. It’s never flat of course on a mountain slope; there are lots of little nooks and crannies which means there are different areas of shade and different angles of sunlight exposure. This leads to very different ground level temperatures; there can be 4-degree differences in just a few metres. And since different plants thrive in different conditions each different species has a good chance to find the exact conditions it prefers.

“Topography adds to habitat diversity” Körner told me. “And if there’s a lot of different niches for life you can imagine you can nest a higher number of species in close proximity.” If one patch becomes too hot a species will find another spot with slightly more shade and therefore lower temperatures and another species will take its place.

Chris Cummins

Körner’s studies have been helped by long-term monitoring projects such as the one that has seen researcher Evelyn Brunner comb the mountain slopes year after year documenting which plants grow where; and then mapping the results. She describes her long days in the mountains as a sort of “detective work”.

The National Park Hohe Tauern is an excellent place to do this because the high level of protection means that much of the most direct human impact (besides our emissions of course) is greatly reduced. She has noticed changes year after year perhaps following a particularly snowy winter or a particularly hot summer but generally as the planet warms the same Alpine plants are found in different areas rather than disappearing entirely.

Plants are climate resilient we are not

This story of resilience didn’t fit in to my Eeyorish expectations.

Nowadays when scientists invite you to learn about the impact of climate change you expect bad news. The mountains are particularly vulnerable to climate change. I have spent much of this year indeed much of the past two decades learning how higher global temperatures are decimating biodiversity.

Given the high Alps are warming at double the rate of the global average temperature rise the obvious health of these meadows came as a surprise.

“I would make a distinction between the wild alpine flora above the tree line which is adjusted to change to variation to extremes” said Körner. “When people use the term vulnerability they should actually explicitly refer to humans in mountains because this is where the problems come. There are problems in the settlements in the power lines and in the traffic routes. The wild flora and fauna is quite robust against these changes.

No „Escalator of Extinction“?

The scientific community is of course known for its rigorous culture of debate and disagreement.

Professor Christian Körner’s optimistic view on the robust future of alpine plants contrasts strongly with the headline grabbing study published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution last year; a study I covered for FM4. That study published in January 2021 suggested that alpine flowers could go extinct after glaciers disappear as more competitive species colonize terrain higher up in the mountainside.

Up The Mountain or Around The Corner?

Lead researcher Dr Gianalberto Losapio an ecologist from the University of Lausanne spoke of “an escalator of extinction”. He told me his research has shown that how iconic Alpine plants need to move to a higher-altitude habitat as the climate warms and that since eventually there would be not more space for them to do so they would eventually die out.

Losapio and his team predicted that 22% of species studied on four glaciers in the Italian Alps would disappear from the area once the glaciers have gone and that the results from Italy would be replicated elsewhere in the Alps.

Körner disagrees. That’s partly because of the height of the Alps; which means he says there is still space to climb into. But it is also partly because of this varied topography. “Frankly I do not believe this expectation is based on facts” he says. “The facts we have do not show anything like this. The plants here and the animals here don’t have to march up the slopes. They just go around the corner and find a cool spot. This is the advantage of being in a structured landscape where on every step you take you will find a different microenvironment.”

Most have yet to implement an official remote-only or in-person-only strategy instead easing hesitant workers back into the office with a hybrid policy. But many have been operating in a tale of two cities forcing retail workers back to the frontlines a year before requiring corporate employees to return to the office.

From Walmart to Amazon here’s a breakdown of the top 10 Fortune 500’s return-to-office policies.

1. Walmart

Walmart’s retail workers referred to as in-house associates worked through the pandemic while its corporate workers worked from home for over a year. Walmart released a company memo in October 2021 stating that corporate employees would transition to coming into the office on a “more regular basis” in November.

But Walmart’s 10000 tech employees were excluded from the decision; the company announced in May 2020 that this largely Silicon Valley-based group could work remotely indefinitely as the pandemic waned.

A spokesperson for the company tells Fortune campus-office associates have been coming into the office more regularly since February. In a February email Walmart provided to Fortune Donna Morris chief people officer said it’s the company’s intention to create a collaborative environment on campus while working toward more flexibility.

“Our ways of working will vary across teams” she wrote. “We believe it’s important that we aren’t overly prescriptive and in the nature of flexibility we all need to be open to ambiguity. We will not mandate in and out of office days or start and finish times.”

She left it open to bosses to decide what meetings can be attended in-person and on-campus but added that the company believes “it’s important to be together in our offices the majority of the time” writing that Walmart’s culture leadership relationship building and creativity all benefit when workers are together.

2. Amazon

Amazon delivery and warehouse workers continued to provide goods throughout lockdown reportedly dealing with grueling conditions while corporate employees worked from home. In October 2021 Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained in a company memo that Amazon continues to be in “a stage of experimenting learning and adjusting for a while as we emerge from this pandemic.”

In said company memo which Amazon referred Fortune to when asked for comment Jassy allows directors on individual teams to decide how many days their reports should come into the office. Jassy maintained that the company is flexible but that Amazon workers should live close enough to their office to come in within a day’s notice.

In September Jassy made it clear that Amazon isn’t looking to push an office mandate any time soon. “We don’t have a plan to require people to come back. We don’t right now. But we’re going to proceed adaptively as we learn” he said.

3. Apple

CEO Tim Cook has pushed corporate employees slowly back to the office under a hybrid model.

“For many of you I know that returning to the office represents a long-awaited milestone and a positive sign that we can engage more fully with the colleagues who play such an important role in our lives” Cook said. “For others it may also be an unsettling change.”

Employees were asked to come into the office beginning April 11th reaching a minimum of three in-person days by March 23rd. Many employees (about 76%) were dissatisfied and 56% reported that they were looking to quit.

Though Cook’s previous plans were thwarted by another round of COVID-19 infections Apple recently announced employees should save the date to come in three times a week starting September 5th.

Meanwhile Apple retail employees have been unionizing for better working conditions. It’s working: Apple agreed to make work schedules at all of its retail stores more flexible.

Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

4. CVS Health

Many pharmacists and other retail workers stayed in stores during the pandemic to take care of customers’ increasing medical needs says Erin Britt director of corporate communications at CVS Health.

Corporate employees were ushered back to the office starting March 15th. “As part of our new hybrid work format most corporate employees are spending two to three days each week at one of our office locations and working virtually on the other days” Britt tells Fortune.

5. UnitedHealth Group

UnitedHealth Group has implemented all three work models: “hybrid fully telecommute and core on-site” with an emphasis on flexible work according to an official statement the company sent Fortune.

The healthcare and insurance company pointed out that they’ve always had both remote and on-site employees but the bulk of workers right now are mostly hybrid.

“The hybrid model will apply to many of our traditionally office-based employees who will now average about three days per week in the office” reads the statement. “The hybrid model is flexible and based on manager discretion.”

6. Exxon Mobil

On-site employees seemingly remained working in person through the pandemic; in March 2020 an article on the company’s site read “For those employees whose work requires them to be at one of our facilities we have put additional safety measures in place.”

Employees based in Houston (where Exxon plans to move its headquarters to next year) were expected to return to office five days a week starting mid-May of 2021 according to Bloomberg.

“Most of our Houston-campus employees are back in the office while continuing to benefit from our workplace flexibility programs” Todd Spitler Corporate Media Relations Senior Advisor tells Fortune. He adds that while the company believes that “business is best run from our offices and workplaces” there are workforce flexibility programs that can be approved by a supervisor.

7. Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett was one of the first leaders to publicly question if people would ever return to the office after the pandemic. Charlie Munger vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway continued Buffett’s sentiment in February 2022 saying that a large portion of workers who would rather not be in the office would remain that way forever.

There’s no public official statement on the company’s policy but when Fortune called headquarters an administrative worker revealed that each branch is making its own decisions with HR on whether employees will return to office.

8. Alphabet

Alphabet’s subsidiary Google is bringing corporate workers back to headquarters on a hybrid schedule.

Google’s corporate employees were expected to return to the office three days a week starting April 2022. A representative informed Fortune that the decision was made in light of employee feedback. But there’s still room for flexibility as “employees who need more time before returning can also request a work-from-home extension.”

Feedback on the corporate roll-out of return to office varied based on the employee but the company has received backlash for its pay adjustments based on where remote workers are located.

But Google’s extended workforce—which includes vendors and temporary staff who work on short-term projects—was compensated for time spent off explains a representative to Fortune: “Throughout the pandemic members of our extended workforce who were affected by reduced office schedules and closures were compensated for the time they would have worked.”

9. McKesson

McKesson’s frontline healthcare workers continued to work during the pandemic. “During the midst of a pandemic thousands of Team McKesson members continue to work every day in order to deliver vital medical products to the frontline in the fight against COVID-19” its website reads.

An Indeed poll of about 4000 McKesson employees found that 61% said they could work remotely. As of now the company has advertised both remote and in-person positions. Reviews on Glassdoor from employees emphasize the company’s flexibility; one from March 2022 says “employs an office as a destination approach where you go to the office to collaborate but perform your duties remotely.”

McKesson did not respond to requests for comment.

10. AmerisourceBergen

The drug wholesale company is “working under a hybrid model called the ‘Work Smart Platform’ meaning that team members are encouraged to work from home and come into the office when they desire” spokeswoman Mackenzie Liberatori told The Mercury in October 2021.

AmerisourceBergen didn’t provide Fortune with details on its return-to-office policies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMTQvc3VydmV5LWZpbmFuY2lhbC1wcmVzc3VyZS1pcy1jYXVzaW5nLXBlb3BsZS10by1jdXQtYmFjay1vbi10aGVyYXB5Lmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9zdXJ2ZXktZmluYW5jaWFsLXByZXNzdXJlLWlzLWNhdXNpbmctcGVvcGxlLXRvLWN1dC1iYWNrLW9uLXRoZXJhcHkuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Co-pays childcare costs and gas prices are some of the reasons people cut back on therapy this year survey finds,"More than a third of Americans who stopped going to therapy this year cited money — including secondary costs like childcare and transportation — and insurance coverage as the cause according to a recent survey conducted by Verywell Mind.

""For many people it's the increased costs. The gas money to go to therapy is now higher"" says Amy Morin editor in chief of Verywell Mind and licensed psychotherapist ""People have to pay more for babysitters so they can go see a therapist. And then of course a lot of therapists are raising their rates given the rise in inflation too.""

Though inflation seems to be slowing down according to the latest Consumer Price Index figures overall U.S. inflation is still high.

Some people are finding ways to lower out-of-pocket therapy costs by reducing the frequency of their sessions to once a month from three to four.

Others are turning to their loved ones for support with 38% of the 1000 survey participants reporting that they required financial assistance from someone else to pay for therapy.

What's more: even people whose therapy sessions are covered in part by insurance worry that they will struggle to afford it long-term. Over 60% of participants including those with insurance report that they pay out-of-pocket therapy costs with a total average of $178 each month.

Here are the biggest reasons people in therapy are cutting back on treatment according to the survey:

Insurance/Health benefits ran out/too expensive (37%)

Therapy was too expensive (22%)

Insurance coverage was changed (15%)

Additionally many Americans have multiple therapy-related expenses each month that make paying for their sessions difficult. These are some of the secondary costs of therapy and the percentages of participants in the survey who are paying them:

Gas to drive to therapy: $164 (48%)

Child/eldercare to attend sessions: $100 (31%)

Prescription medication: $40 (67%)

Supplements (vitamins CBD herbal remedies etc.): $31 (73%)

At the same time Americans' mental health is worsening. The Covid-19 pandemic caused a 25% increase in the prevalence of depression and anxiety worldwide in its first year alone according to the World Health Organization. A new survey from CVS Health and Morning Consult found that 59% of U.S. adults reported having concerns about their own mental health or the mental health of friends or family.

""For people who aren't getting treatment right now their symptoms may get worse"" Morin says ""The longer we go without treating those things sometimes the worse the symptoms get and the harder things are to treat.""

Lack of mental health care may affect work productivity relationships family dynamics and could increase chronic health conditions Morin tells CNBC Make It.

If it's becoming harder for you to afford mental health care consider these options recommended by Morin:

Discuss payment options with your therapist

Try group therapy which can often be cheaper

Do online therapy — some services require a monthly fee rather than payment for each session

Read self-help books

Listen to podcasts by therapists

Join a support group

Call the national crisis lifeline at 988 if you urgently need someone to speak to

""For society as a whole there's a cost in not treating people who have mental health issues"" Morin says ""Prevention and early intervention can be key to helping people resolve their symptoms and feel their best.""

No. But the end result was just what she needed to cap off her career.

Nunes (11-7 MMA 5-4 UFC) snapped a two-fight skid Saturday when she eked out a split decision against Cynthia Calvillo (9-5-1 MMA 6-5-1 UFC) on Saturday. The women’s flyweight bout was part of the UFC on ESPN 41 preliminary card at Pechanga Arena.

The fight lacked action for all 15 minutes incurring boos from fans on a few occasions. Rounds 1 and 2 seemingly were close but the third clearly belonged to Nunes who landed her best punch – a hard right hook –in the final frame.

Once the horn sounded Nunes took off her gloves and left them in the center of the octagon before the judges’ scorecards of 28-29 29-28 and 30-27 had been read in her favor. Nunes 36 said earlier in fight week that she still had a championship mentality but it was clear announcing her retirement was a decision she’d made prior to stepping in the cage.

“I am (retiring)” Nunes told Daniel Cormier during her post-fight octagon interview. “As a fighter I think I’ve done what I wanted to. It started as a hobby. I got all the way here. I’m going to focus on coaching and bringing up those girls that are struggling right now.”

She added “I want more babies. So I’m stepping away to have another kid.”

Nina Nunes and UFC double champion Amanda Nunes who are married are parents to daughter Raegan Nunes who turns 2 in September. Nina gave birth to Raegan back in 2020.

Like insulin pump “looping” and iPhone jailbreaking this allows farmers to modify and repair the expensive equipment that’s vital to their work the way they could with analog tractors. At the DefCon security conference in Las Vegas on Saturday the hacker known as Sick Codes is presenting a new jailbreak for John Deere & Co. tractors that allows him to take control of multiple models through their touchscreens.

The finding underscores the security implications of the right-to-repair movement. The tractor exploitation that Sick Codes uncovered isn't a remote attack but the vulnerabilities involved represent fundamental insecurities in the devices that could be exploited by malicious actors or potentially chained with other vulnerabilities. Securing the agriculture industry and food supply chain is crucial as incidents like the 2021 JBS Meat ransomware attack have shown. At the same time though vulnerabilities like the ones that Sick Codes found help farmers do what they need to do with their own equipment.

John Deere did not respond to WIRED's request for comment about the research.

Sick Codes an Australian who lives in Asia presented at DefCon in 2021 about tractor application programming interfaces and operating system bugs. After he made his research public tractor companies including John Deere started fixing some of the flaws. “The right-to-repair side was a little bit opposed to what I was trying to do” he tells WIRED. “I heard from some farmers; one guy emailed me and was like ‘You’re fucking up all of our stuff!’ So I figured I would put my money where my mouth is and actually prove to farmers that they can root the devices.""

This year Sick Codes says that while he is primarily concerned about world food security and the exposure that comes from vulnerable farming equipment he also sees important value in letting farmers fully control their own equipment. “Liberate the tractors!” he says.

After years of controversy in the US over the “right to repair” the equipment one purchases the movement seems to have reached a turning point. The White House issued an executive order last year directing the Federal Trade Commission to increase enforcement efforts over practices like voiding warranties for outside repair. That combined with New York state passing its own right-to-repair law and creative activist pressure has generated unprecedented momentum for the movement.

Facing mounting pressure John Deere announced in March that it would make more of its repair software available to equipment owners. The company also said at the time that it will release an “enhanced customer solution” next year so customers and mechanics can download and apply official software updates for Deere equipment themselves rather than having John Deere unilaterally apply the patches remotely or force farmers to bring products to authorized dealerships.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmljdWx0dXJlLmNvbS9zY2hvb2xidXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old school buses get a new life on the farm,"School buses: I think they get a bad rap. If you ever road the big orange bus than you can probably share a story about your experience riding it to school to a ball game or to some after-school activity.

Over the years I've noticed repurposed school buses on farms and I've been surprised how many different ways they are used. I probably shouldn't be. Farmers are some of the most industrious people I've ever met in taking one piece of equipment and adapting it for another purpose. I think it's pretty cool that farmers find uses for things many people would send to the junkyard or scrap pile.

One day I was talking to a local farmer about his use of school buses and he told me they worked great because anyone could drive them. I always thought you needed a special license like a CDL (Commercial Drivers License — what the 18-wheeler drivers need) for school buses. Nope. I always thought school buses were 5-speed so you had to change gears. Nope. Turns out I could probably drive one. Not that I'm getting any ideas.

Carrying strawberries from the field to the storage building.

With a tank on the back to carry water to the field (not drinking water).

Going back to the field after carrying tobacco to be put in the barn.

Those working in the auction trailer for Harley and Hal Jackson Auctioneers are getting used to the question at sales.

Auctioneer Harley Jackson selling toy tractors.

“Is that the auctioneer out there parking the cars?”

The answer: “Yup he likes to introduce himself and shake your hand as you’re walking into the sale. He enjoys doing that.”

In today’s virtual age society has realized many benefits of doing business online though many parts of life — and some would argue some of the very best parts — can be lost online.

“I’m an old-style auctioneer. I’ve been in the business for 32 years so the in-person live auctions are kind of special to me because that’s what I grew up with. I like to shake hands with the people that are coming to the sales. I like to be able to thank them. It’s just about being personable. That’s how I’ve built my reputation” Harley Jackson said. “We are still a traditional live in-person auction company. We do offer online bidding and online sales. Usually we sit down with the family or the people that we’re having the auction for and I give them my best recommendation. We’re well rounded. We’ll do farm machinery then we’ll follow up and maybe do a farm toy auction. And then we may follow up and have a collectible sale or we’ll sell some firearms and stuff like that.”

In cases where there is only a small amount to sell online only may be the best. In other cases a combination of in-person and online may be better.

“I think the online sales have their place. I think there are certain items that you need to have online sales or online bidding. I think it opens it up to the world” Jackson said. “But some of these auctions in-person provide the ability to make a relationship with the buyers. There are pros and cons. I think the pro of the live in-person auctions is having the ability to communicate with people still shake their hands still look them in the eye and say ‘Hey I’m Harley. How are you today?’ and ‘Thanks for coming.’”

One growing concern about getting people to travel to in-person auctions is rising fuel costs.

“Fuel costs are a worry for us. As of right now though we have not seen that it has deterred anyone from coming. We are still doing live in-person auctions and we’re still getting large crowds there” Jackson said. “We look at the fuel costs with every sale and think ‘This has to affect something.’ But it hasn’t shown up yet.”

For the unique area of farm toys and collectibles in-person auctions have particular value.

“We’ve had several of those sales here in 2022 already that were just strictly for farm toys and collectibles and they’ve really held their value. And I think part of it is that we’ve done those sales live in-person with online bidding. We’ve sent some stuff across the United States but we’ve had large crowds in person too. I think it’s just they want to get out. It doesn’t seem that any brand of farm toys is outselling another. There’s a collector for each brand whether it is John Deere or IH or Minneapolis Moline and we have not seen a downturn in it yet” Jackson said. “We’ve got a guy from up by Lake Erie that will come to our farm toy auctions. And we’ll have a guy from Cincinnati come too. They never knew each other until they started coming to buy farm toys. They will show up and sit beside one another. They visit the whole day and buy farm toys and talk about ‘oh you got this bought’ or ‘I got that bought.’ I do think that has helped keep the farm toys up in value. And we’re also seeing a trend of getting a younger crowd. We’re starting to see some younger generations — grandkids are coming with their grandpa and some boys and girls are coming with their parents— which really makes me excited for that part of the business.”

For land and equipment there has been a more business-like shift.

“The farm auction is a little bit different. If you would have asked me 20 years ago I would have said yeah there’s guys showing up just to eat a cheeseburger off the food stand. Now they’ll visit with the neighbors but it doesn’t seem like they’re there for that. I’m not saying neighbors don’t sit by neighbors but they’re there to do business” he said. “This farmland has gotten so expensive as every other auctioneer will tell you and today it’s real business.”

Whether for business or for pleasure Jackson feels in-person auctions still have something special to offer that cannot be found online.

“I think we’re still creating excitement with in-person auctions. As an auctioneer I’ve watched many online sales. And you know I don’t get the same butterflies in my stomach with an online auction that I do at a live in-person auction on a Saturday morning” he said. “You create excitement and it seems like people still enjoy that.”"

An employment discrimination lawsuit filed by a former Delta Air Lines flight attendant says she was fired for posting an image of former President Donald Trump wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood on her personal Facebook page.

The plaintiff Leondra Taylor who is Black admitted she posted a cartoon image on her personal Facebook page depicting then-President Trump and then-former Vice President Joe Biden during one of their presidential debates in 2020 according to the lawsuit filed Monday in federal district court in Atlanta.

In the cartoon Trump is pictured wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood as he stands at the podium across from Biden. The image includes a quote bubble over the head of the debate moderator saying “Thank you Mr. President for wearing your mask.”

The image was created by editorial cartoonist Aislin and published by the Montreal Gazette on October 1 2020 days after the first 2020 general election presidential debate moderated by Chris Wallace. In that debate Trump was asked by Wallace to denounce White supremacists and militia groups to which the then-President said “Proud Boys stand back and stand by.”

Delta “came across some political posts that it deemed to be in violation of its social media policy” during a review of Taylor’s Facebook page sparked by another employee the lawsuit states. In January 2021 a group of Delta employees told Taylor her posts were unacceptable and said it did not “tolerate disrespectful hateful or discriminatory posts” according to the lawsuit.

A month later Delta notified Taylor it intended to “suspend her employment” and a manager stated that her “political posts were racially motivated” which was given as the reason for her termination the lawsuit reads.

The lawsuit which alleges Delta “discriminated against plaintiff because of her race” contends that Taylor’s posts were “political statements but they were not hateful or discriminatory.”

It argues the cartoon showing Trump in the mask “simultaneously made a statement about Trump’s denial of the need for Covid protective measures and that racial discrimination against African Americans was a systemic issue starting at the top with the then president.”

It also alleges non-African American employees at Delta weren’t subject to the same penalties for their activity on social media.

Taylor is suing for general damages for mental and emotional suffering; punitive damages for what the lawsuit calls the “defendant’s willful malicious intentional and deliberate acts”; and lost wages.

A Delta spokesperson responded to Taylor’s federal lawsuit to CNN in a statement: “When Delta employees intermix Delta’s brand with conduct or content that does not reflect our values of professionalism inclusion and respect that conduct can result in discipline or termination. While personnel issues are considered private between Delta and its employees the circumstances described by our former employee are not an accurate or complete explanation of the company’s termination decision.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2RlbHRhLWZsaWdodC1hdHRlbmRhbnQtdHJ1bXAta2trL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines Flight Attendant Terminated For Trump KKK Cartoon Now Suing For Racial Discrimination,"A Delta Air Lines flight attendant who was sacked for sharing a controversial political cartoon on Facebook about former President Donald Trump is now suing Delta claiming racial discrimination.

Delta Flight Attendant Suing For Racial Discrimination After Being Fired For Sharing Trump KKK Political Cartoon

Former Delta flight attendant Leondra Taylor shared the following image on her Facebook page:

In the cartoon Trump is pictured wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood at a debate with President Joe Biden moderated by Chris Wallace with the caption “Thank You Mr. President For Wearing Your Mask.”

As we’ve discussed before Delta has a strict policy regulating social media use. In 2020 flight attendant Kevin Lee Jennings left the company after posting a series of controversial tweets including:

“My employer Atlanta’s hometown airline is in a massive crises because of a virus that has taken the lives of 40 people. How many were killed in Chicago during the same time frame?”

or

“I see plenty of scrawny black anarchists out there too. And none of them are social distancing or really wearing masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. I have numerous white friends who live on Lake Street in MSP BTW it’s their neighborhood too.”

> Read More: Was Feisty Delta Flight Attendant Forced Out For Conservative Tweets?

Jennings was such a high profile flight attendant that her departure prompted a memo from Delta CEO Ed Bastian on proper employee social media use:

“I want to make it clear that Delta’s workplace must remain safe and welcoming for all Delta people. We will not tolerate racist bigoted or hateful acts or statements in our workspaces or directed at our people… “This includes racial and other bigoted hateful and offensive comments on social media by Delta people which hurts our culture and our people.”

Interestingly Taylor had been one of the flight attendants who had vocally called out and even assisted Delta in trying to throw another flight attendant over social media use. But then Delta started digging through her own social media accounts.

Her lawsuit which claims non-black employees were not subjected to termination for similar posts also denies that the controversial cartoon was disrespectful hateful or discriminatory. According to the lawsuit:

“In fact her post was quite the opposite. It simultaneously made a statement about Trump’s denial of the need for COVID protective measures and that racial discrimination against African Americans was a systemic issue starting at the top with the then president.”

All this while important is secondary to me. The questions we need to be asking are 1.) whether there was a link between her Facebook account and her employment with Delta and 2.) whether other employees were treated differently than her on the basis of race. Were there pictures of her in uniform or on Delta aircraft in the same Facebook account? Were other employees not punished for posting the same or similar cartoons?

A Delta spokesperson shared:

“When Delta employees intermix Delta’s brand with conduct or content that does not reflect our values of professionalism inclusion and respect that conduct can result in discipline or termination. “While personnel issues are considered private between Delta and its employees the circumstances described by our former employee are not an accurate or complete explanation of the company’s termination decision.”

My guess is that Taylor will lose her lawsuit unless she can find numerous examples of non-black employees having mixed work with politics in a similar matter who were not punished. She seems to have violated Delta’s social media policy and her statements trying to downplay the incendiary nature of the cartoon will fall upon deaf ears.

But that doesn’t mean I like what happened to her. Spare me the outrage over the cartoon…it makes an incendiary but important point in our political dialogue. It’s the sort of speech that should be protected…and I say the same thing about Jennings’ political speech.

I’m against most efforts to censor or punish political speech that is uncomfortable or controversial. Sometimes we need to have difficult conversations and political cartoons have long served as a catalyst for such discussion.

Even though Taylor seems to have violated Delta’s social media policy it’s a bad policy in the first place. There’s a difference however between a bad policy and a legal policy.

You can read Taylor’s complaint here.

CONCLUSION

A black Delta flight attendant is suing for racial discrimination after she was terminated for sharing an anti-Trump political cartoon. She claims non-black employees were not punished as harshly. If she can prove that she certainly has a case but to me the more important issue is that Delta is terminating employees for expressing the sort of political discussion that marks a vibrant republic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzEzL2RlbHRhLWZpcmVkLWZsaWdodC1hdHRlbmRhbnQtZm9yLXBvc3RpbmctY2FydG9vbi13aXRoLXRydW1wLWluLWtsYW4taG9vZC1sYXdzdWl0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta fired flight attendant for posting cartoon with Trump in Klan hood: lawsuit,"Delta Air Lines fired a flight attendant for posting a political cartoon with Donald Trump in a Ku Klux Klan hood according to a lawsuit filed Monday.

Leondra Taylor filed the employment discrimination lawsuit in response to her dismissal in April 2021 CNN reported.

The cartoon in question was published by the Montreal Gazette and riffed on the first presidential debate in September 2020. Trump is pictured behind a debate podium with the Klan hood over his head. Moderator Chris Wallace’s quote bubble reads: “Thank you Mr. President for wearing your mask.”

A Delta plane is seen at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta on Feb. 18 2021.

During the debate Trump was asked to disavow far-right extremists and responded by telling the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.”

Taylor said that she did indeed share the cartoon on her personal Facebook page according to CNN. However Taylor who is Black argued that Delta “discriminated against (her) because of her race.”

In the suit she said the post was a political statement but not “hateful or discriminatory” CNN reported. She said the cartoon “simultaneously made a statement about Trump’s denial of the need for COVID protective measures and that racial discrimination against African Americans was a systemic issue starting at the top with the then president.”

Delta said Taylor violated the company’s social media policy.

EDF Energy who operates operator of Hinkley Point has applied to Sedgemoor District Council to change the staff accommodation area on the site.

The move would mean the holiday park would be used by workers from November 2022 for three years before it reverted back to its original use. The owners have applied for an environmental impact assessment study to assess whether the change is likely to have significant effects on the environment.

The application states: “There are no building works proposed as part of the planning application. Improvements will be made to the site and the facilities prior to the use by HPC workers and as such will seek to create a positive legacy when the holiday park reverts to general tourist use.

“The improvements will comprise of renovation and modernisation of the chalet units improvements to the electrical supply installation of Wi-Fi connections and upgrading the infrastructure.”

The Pontins site which is in close proximity to the nuclear plant is visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists each year. Some residents have already raised concerns about the park becoming busy all year round.

Britannia Hotels say this would not be the case as workers are likely to be located within the chalets during the evening. In the application it states: “It is considered that the use of the facilities at Brean Sands will not represent an increase in comparison to the current use of the site by general tourists.

“It could be considered that there would be a decrease in the air noise and nuisance during the day as the majority of workers will be located at HPC. “ The news comes after it was revealed earlier this year that Hinkley Point C will start operating a year later than planned and will cost an extra £3 billion.

French energy giant EDF published the findings of a review into the cost and schedule of the power station taking account of the continuing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The revised operating date is June 2027 and the budget has increased by £3 billion.

EDF said this will have no cost impact on British consumers or taxpayers. The holiday complex regularly comes under fire from guest who complain about dirty and outdated chalets.

Andrew Cockcroft EDF’s senior manager for community relations said: “As Hinkley Point C’s workforce increases we are actively exploring a wide range of options for additional accommodation. We will work closely with the local community around any new accommodation site as our plans develop in the months ahead.”

But what is the best day to shop? Is it when sales start or end? Or the same date as the new inventory comes in?

It all depends on which store you're shopping at.

The Sun rounded up the answers to these questions to help you save the most money on your next shopping trip.

Below's what you need to know about Dollar General Walmart and Target.

Dollar General

Many TikTokers recommend shopping at Dollar General on Saturdays to use special coupons.

These coupons offer $5 off a $25 purchase. This can be combined with other coupons to maximize your savings.

TikTok user MadCouponingWithMads shared a way to get $25 worth of products for just $5 using this coupon.

She used digital coupons worth $15 worth after scanning the $5 off of $25.

At the end of the transaction each item rang up for about 57 cents.

Target has a general schedule for markdowns in different departments that make it easy to decide when to shop.

According to All Things Target the clearance schedule goes as followed:

Monday – Electronics children's clothing baby items books

Tuesday – Women's clothing pets domestics

Wednesday – Men's clothing health beauty garden

Thursday – Homeware toys sporting equipment travel

Friday – Auto cosmetics jewelry

Target goes through a few cycles of clearance first marking things down by 30% then 50% and finally 70%.

It's also important to note the items that get price reductions vary from store to store so it's worth checking different locations.

The stores get new shipments overnight so going first thing in the morning will give you the best options for new inventory.

Walmart

Like other stores Walmart doesn't necessarily have a set schedule for when each store gets new shipments.

But based on everything ShopFood.com could find it recommends shopping early Wednesday mornings.

Typically perishable items are restocked overnight. Picking your produce and other fresh food early in the morning will ensure you get the best pick.

Shopping midweek offers a less crowded shop meaning there are more items for you to pick through.

Check with your local store to find out the exact day they get shipments.

Walmart typically starts clearance sales during the first week of every month according to Query Sprout.

Shopping the first through the fifth of the month will give you great options for clearance.

Don't forget to check for Walmart hidden clearance items by scanning prices through the store's app.

These prices are marked down online and in the app before having the prices adjusted in the store.

Some items may be on display for full price but scanning them will tell you if they're on sale.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal Facebook’s parent company Meta is partnering with DoorDash to deliver Marketplace items located up to 15 miles away.

Not every item is eligible for delivery though. Sources tell the WSJ that DoorDash will only deliver items that are small enough to fit in the trunk of a car and that drivers are expected to make deliveries within 48 hours. Either way it sounds like a helpful option for anyone who isn’t able to pick up an item themselves.

It also fills a gap in Facebook Marketplace’s existing local delivery options which only lets you get larger items delivered through a service called Dolly. The service is limited to a little over two dozen cities throughout the US and lets you connect with one or two local “helpers” that will load bulky items — like a refrigerator bookshelf or air conditioner — into a pickup truck and deliver them to your house for a fee.

The new substation will be located centrally in the northern part of the district on HWY 105 next to the Dollar General. ESD officials hope that construction will be completed by early 2023.

According to Board President Klint Bush ESD No. 7 is awaiting the completion of paperwork for state permits to install new culverts to begin leveling and building that new location.

“We are excited for the opportunity to finally begin construction on our new Moss Hill substation and improve our emergency response throughout the district” said Bush.

Part of that improvement Bush says will come from the firefighters that reside on the northern end of the district and the fact they will no longer have to go all the way to Hardin just to return north to the Moss Hill area.

The new substation will include three apparatus bays with a brush truck and engine on sight shortly after it opens said Bush.

The ESD will relocate their existing engine to Moss Hill after officially acquiring a new engine they have recently purchased at the cost of $300000. According to Bush that truck will take anywhere from six months to a year to receive.

“We’re able to do all of this with the sales tax citizens voted on a few years ago and we have managed to lower the property taxes for the citizens of ESD 7” said Bush.

Bush said the board takes its role seriously and conducts its budgeting process just like any family that resides in the district.

“Your ESD Board of Commissioners maintains conservative spending and tries to balance wants versus needs while being efficient good stewards of the people’s money” said Bush.

ESD No. 7/ Hardin Fire & Rescue is under the command of Nicolus Nelson.

After 16 years in business Ace Hardware in Baker is closing down. Store owner Andy Carlson blamed rising labor and rent. And a rise in crime.

“My phone’s been blowing up and I just think that our customers are going to really miss us” the 54-year-old said.

The hardware store at 417 S. Broadway sits in a retail strip next to a Sally’s and Dollar Tree. All three of the businesses will be gone by the end of next January according to the property’s owner. The stores are part of a large retail complex that is gradually being redeveloped into an apartment-heavy neighborhood dubbed Broadway Park.

Although planned redevelopment meant the store would have to close in the near future Carlson’s reasons for shuttering the doors now relate to problems faced by multiple retailers.

The store has about $3.5 million in sales per year Carlson said.

“In a good year a top-tier hardware store like this could do 7 percent at the bottom pre-tax net profit. We’ve been squeezed into below five” Carlson said.

First there’s rising wages. Denver’s minimum wage has increased by about 43 percent since 2019 and will increase another 9 percent above current levels next year.

Carlson has responded by decreasing his staff count. Typically the store employed 35 people starting in May to prepare for the retailer’s busy season. This year though Carlson said Ace has just 18 people on staff.

“Our payroll has to be less than 20 percent of our sales or we’re just not profitable. So when the wages go up it’s just like OK we have to make do with less people” he said.

Another issue was occupancy costs. As the area surrounding Ace gets redeveloped the property taxes the business pays due to its triple-net lease have risen.

Carlson said a successful Ace store can generally spend just 12 percent of its revenue on its real estate costs. He said his store has spent as much as 16 percent.

The third strike for the store was the increase in crime in the neighborhood Carlson said. Not a single break-in occurred in his first 14 years of business. Since the pandemic the store has had three.

And crime has not been limited to break-ins. The store had its truck stolen last September and the truck’s catalytic converter was stolen separately twice. Shoplifting has also increased; Carlson blames lax laws for the increased brazenness of the thieves.

“There’s no penalty whatsoever if you steal less than $1000 – nothing happens” he said.

The sentence for the 22-year-old woman who stole the store’s truck was 30 days of probation and a mandatory rehab program Carlson said. He said he received a letter shortly after the sentencing saying that the woman had skipped out on probation. It was her third time being convicted of a similar crime Carlson recalled the judge saying at the sentencing.

Carlson said he is joining an IT support company Dilse.it as its new CEO. He has a degree in computer science and prior to owning Ace worked at various IT firms. Dilse currently services about 40 Ace locations as well as various other small businesses.

“I’m continuing to be a business person in Denver. I believe in the city it’s a great place. It’s just hard for retailers right now” Carlson said.

The Sally’s and Dollar Tree adjacent to Ace will close at the end of the year and the end of January according to Chris Waggett CEO of D4 Urban whose firm owns the property and has master-planned the Broadway Park project.

Plans are underway for roughly 500 apartment units to be built at the site of the three stores Waggett said.

3 The Dollar Tree flip-flops won't last very long per Sarah Credit: TikTok/sensationalfinds

1. Shampoos and conditioners

According to Sarah the Dollar Tree shampoos and conditioners may not be worth the low price.

It's a low-quality issue that will come back to bite shoppers Sarah explains.

""They don't have great quality it's not great ingredients"" she claims.

Sarah instead recommends some deep conditioner packs that Dollar Tree has as well as you don't need to buy them nearly as often and most are name brand.

2. Flip-flops and sandals

Sarah says that Dollar Tree's flip-flops and sandals are definitely something that you should refrain from grabbing as well.

""Unless you're using them for just the shower then these are not good quality they don't hold up they don't last"" Sarah claims.

If you're looking for a lasting sandal that will be more durable and last longer another sandal from other department stores may be a better option per Sarah.

For any beach needs Sarah recommends that shoppers reach for Dollar Tree's sunglasses instead with better designs and quality for the price.

3. Batteries

The next item to avoid per Sarah's recommendation are the Dollar Tree batteries.

She explains that shoppers are likely not getting enough charge for their buck — unless they're grabbing the ""high-drain"" batteries.

These batteries that aren't high-drain aren't quality and don't last nearly as long as others according to Sarah.

4. Garbage bags

According to Sarah the Dollar Tree trash bags are another item that should be avoided next time shoppers make a trip to the store.

""These are terrible quality you don't get many in there — they don't last"" Sarah says.

She says that you should instead reach for Dollar Tree's organizational bins.

5. Candles

Lastly Sarah recommends that shoppers also avoid the Dollar Tree candles next time they head to the store as well.

""Stop buying them they have no throw they don't last they're terrible"" Sarah explains.

Per her experience she says that shoppers should avoid the candles and instead reach for the odor absorbers that Dollar Tree also has.

Ultimately Sarah believes that there can be better quality for the price on other items in the store and outside of it for your needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcTEwNjUuZm0vZG8teW91LXJlbWVtYmVyLXdoZW4tbWFpbmUtaGFkLXRob3NlLXdpY2tlZC1jb29sLXNlcnZpY2UtbWVyY2hhbmRpc2Utc3RvcmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do You Remember When Maine Had Service Merchandise Stores?,"Here's a throwback for you. SERVICE MERCHANDISE. Do you remember the picnic store?

YouTube YouTube loading...

What Was Service Merchandise?

Maine had a handful of them back in the day. I remember being on the South Portland and Lewiston stores and we thought they were THE FUTURE of retail! The store wasn't actually a store. It was a showroom. And how you got what you wanted was an amazing journey!

YouTube YouTube loading...

How Did You Shop at Service Merchandise?

When you found something on the showroom floor you wanted you would write down the model on your little Service Merchandise notepad.

YouTube YouTube loading...

Then you would pay. And then the MAGIC WAIT. You would stand next to the conveyor belt and wait for your item to come through. As the Tom Petty song goes the waiting is the hardest part!

YouTube YouTube loading...

And for some really big items that were too big for the conveyor belt you could just bring a store employee the tag they would go find it for you and you would pick it up out back.

YouTube YouTube loading...

Service Merchandise had all kinds of great things. Jewelry was big and so were toys and electronics like this beautiful microwave for only $144.82. That was a ton of money back in the 1980s!

YouTube YouTube loading...

The centerpiece of the Service Merchandise experience was the catalog. This was a big deal in my family when the catalog arrived.

YouTube YouTube loading...

Check out this very sassy Service Merch commercial. It kind of looks like a Whitesnake video you would've seen on MTV in 1989.

Service Merchandise had a great run; from 1960 until the early 2000s. At its peak in the '70s and '80s it was a 4 BILLION dollar company. But then the big box stores like Walmart came into Maine and that along with the advent of online shopping was the end of Service Merchandise.

I still think of the store whenever I go by the old location in South Portland. Now it's the spot for the Guitar Center and Dollar Tree by the Mall.

The old American five-and-dime store to make a long discussion on economics and changing times short has gone the way of the horse and buggy Model T's and gramophone record players. For those who may be too young to know what such a store is UnitedStatesNow explains they were stores where you could purchase your household goods and assorted merchandise on the cheap for prices between a nickel and a dime — hence the name five-and-dime. In a way these stores were the predecessor to other discount stores such as Dollar Tree which serves a similar purpose in the community.

One of the giants of the five-and-dime market was Woolworth's. The brainchild of entrepreneur Frank Woolworth the first successful Woolworth's Five Cent Store opened in Lancaster Pennsylvania in 1879. So popular was the concept of the ""five-and-dime"" that according to the Library of Congress Woolworth's not only had 596 stores in the United States in 1912 but had also expanded into international markets too. Another remarkable characteristic of Woolworth's stores was its lunch counters. Much like the modern-day food court these cafeterias served customers sandwiches fries milkshakes and other inexpensive and easy-to-make foods. These lunch counters not only helped to bring in more profit but also encouraged customers to stay around and shop in between lunch breaks.

Of course nowadays Woolworth's lunch counters have been replaced by drive-thru lanes and delivery services. But should you feel nostalgic there's still one place that has an operating Woolworth's lunch counter."

Up until recently the cinder-block well provided all the water for his house. But now the groundwater is filled with sediment and Johnson is planning to fill the well with water from a nearby stream that’s less likely to fill up with dirt.

“So what I gotta do I gotta flush. I gotta pump. I’ll probably pump water for two hours” he said of his plans for the upcoming weekend.

Johnson 62 has lived on this farm almost his entire life and still has big hopes for his land: He wants to attract the rusty patched bumble bee this season and is growing a bounty of pumpkins corn and squash. But not being able to use his main source of water something feels off.

He traces his problems back to the moment in 2015 when representatives of the Mountain Valley Pipeline approached him to lay a natural gas pipeline across his land in exchange for a flat rate. Johnson held out for several years but knowing the company was likely to gain access to his land through eminent domain he felt he had little choice.

“How do you take a payment for putting a scar across a family member?” he asked.

After that Johnson’s water filled with sediment he believes is from the pipeline’s disruption which made the water too dirty to drink cook or bathe in. Eventually he gave up and turned the pump off and since then he’s had to either buy water from the grocery store or haul it from a spring 40 minutes away.

Now Johnson dedicates the vast majority of his time documenting the pipeline’s land and water violations across Greenbrier Summers and Monroe counties. For years he and other pipeline opponents have stalled the project which is planned to stretch 303 miles across West Virginia and into Virginia. Though construction is nearly complete not counting the land restoration the company has to do the pipeline is four years overdue and the cost has ballooned from $3.5 billion to $6.6 billion. This is largely because repeatedly rulings from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals have found that key aspects of the pipeline — its impact on water endangered species and national forests— don’t comply with the law.

A few weeks ago the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline looked like an increasingly distant possibility. Then Sen. Joe Manchin D-W.Va. stepped in. In exchange for supporting the Democrats’ most recent climate and economy bill Manchin got Democratic leaders’ support for a host of permitting changes. Among them was a directive for Congress to “require the relevant agencies to take all necessary actions to permit the construction and operation of the Mountain Valley Pipeline” and to move all new legislation regarding the pipeline to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals the pipeline’s preferred venue.

Now Johnson and other pipeline opponents in southeastern West Virginia are continuing to fight a project that Manchin is compelling Congress to greenlight.

In Summers County Mark Jarrell is sitting in his living room on his 90-acre property. His house is the only structure on the expanse of land.

“The fact is I own this freakin’ place. Don’t I have any say so?” he asks his voice echoing off of the metal-lined cathedral ceilings above him.

Mark Jarrell showing his property in Summers County WV. Photo by Alexa Beyer.

Jarrell spent much of his adult life in Florida but can trace his family’s history in West Virginia back to the Revolutionary War. He bought his property in the hopes that other family members would return and build their own houses on it. Some of them had plans to do exactly that but abandoned them after the pipeline was built down the middle of Jarrell’s land starting at a spot he was saving for someone else: the knob at the top of the hill overlooking the Greenbrier River.

“You work your entire life to save up for something you have plans and dreams and you start in. Somebody shows up and just throws a monkey wrench in it” he said.

Jarrell remembers the day he woke up in the spring of 2018 and heard construction trucks on his property. Notably he had not yet reached a settlement with the company. He soon settled with the company out of fear that if he didn’t the pipeline would happen anyway and he’d be left without compensation.

Now there are 17 piles of rotting logs on Jarrell’s property — former trees that Mountain Valley Pipeline cut down during construction. He can’t remove the logs because he can’t drive a vehicle over the rectangular land masses the company built in numerous places on his field to prevent erosion. In addition to the pipeline itself it’s another way that his land doesn’t really feel like his.

Unlike Johnson Jarrell hasn’t quite allowed the pipeline battle to consume his life. But he like a number of residents near the route fear that the pipeline will explode somewhere like Trans-Canada’s Midstream pipeline did in Marshall County in 2018 and a NiSource natural gas pipeline did in Kanawha County in 2012 among other pipeline explosions in the state over the past decade.

If the pipeline ever starts carrying gas a scenario that’s played in the back of Jarrell’s mind will take on a new life.

“I’m not gonna snap at this age” he says as he motors his John Deere tractor up his property’s steep slope. “Unless …”

He pauses.

“Unless for instance say I ran down to the store when my granddaughter’s here and the explosion happens she’s burned alive and I’m not.”

Mountain Valley Pipeline spokesperson Natalie Cox wouldn’t respond directly to Jarrell’s and Johnson’s experiences but said the project has been subject to meticulous analysis.

“The MVP project along with all submitted plans and processes have undergone rigorous review and evaluation for more years and in many cases has been subject to a level of scrutiny that is unprecedented for a project of this nature” she said.

She also referenced a letter the company sent to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality in May of last year in which the company addressed opponents’ criticism of its erosion control measures.

“Mountain Valley’s erosion and sediment control plans meet all applicable federal and state regulatory requirements as approved by DEQ. To date and despite constant restatements and repackaging of their arguments no parties have identified any technical or regulatory flaws in those plans” it said.

Not everyone who lives along the route is against the Mountain Valley Pipeline. James Kimble owns property in the project’s path in Braxton County.

Kimble says he witnessed first-hand how an energy company can boost a local economy a few years ago when Dominion Energy built the now-canceled Atlantic Coast Pipeline through his primary community in Upshur County and his friend’s business took off as a result.

“Motels were full Walmarts were full grocery stores were full” he said.

Kimble whose father spent 40 years working in the natural gas industry says he doesn’t have any safety concerns about the pipeline and sees the project as important to the country’s energy independence.

“They have to get it out of here somehow to help other parts of the country” he said.

As a self-described naturalist Kimble was pleased with the restoration work that Mountain Valley Pipeline has done over his segment of the pipeline — so pleased that it prompted him to write a letter of support to FERC last month urging the commission to grant the company a four-year extension on its construction permit.

Kimble’s comment was one of nine that Mountain Valley Pipeline assessed were from landowners in support of the project. In total more than 570 comments were submitted to regulators about the company’s request most of them in opposition.

Back in Monroe County Dr. Dana Olson stands in the middle of the road that runs over the base of Peter’s Mountain his gaze fixed towards his hands as he tries to put words to his thoughts and feelings. The pipeline is being built near his house on the mountain and behind him is a massive patch on the top of the slope where Mountain Valley Pipeline has cleared the trees for construction.

“Environmental irresponsibility we see that all around us. The thing that gets me is an ethical thing” Olson said while he and Johnson talk about how the pipeline has seemed to strategically time its requests for approval with various political events. Then of course there was Olson’s daughter and grandchildren who used to live next to him on Peters Mountain before moving away because of the pipeline.

“In fact I was congratulating them yesterday for having moved because of the Manchin thing. And that they had made a good decision” he said.

One reason Peters Mountain is special is that it makes a roar Olson and Johnson explain. The mountain practically a nonstop ridge for 50 miles is angled so it acts as a massive woodwind instrument. Some locals say they can predict the weather based on the sounds the mountain makes.

Johnson drives down the mountain and crosses into Virginia. It’s between dusk and dark. He pulls over to the side of the road to give directions to the interstate before heading in the opposite direction. He points out a Mountain Valley Pipeline security truck as it passes a truck Johnson says has been following him all the way down the mountain.

The road splits the truck follows Johnson and it begins to rain.

Correction: A previous version of the story misstated where Maury Johnson lives. It is in Monroe County West Virginia. Johnson turned the pump to his well off after it filled up with sediment which he attributes to the disruption caused by the Mountain Valley Pipeline.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The last of the Domino’s Pizza locations in Italy have shuttered and left after the company that owned them filed for bankruptcy. According to sources Covid-19 also played a significant part in affecting the franchise holder gravely.

According to the bankruptcy proceedings the firm directly controlled 23 locations in Italy as of 2020 with another six stores handled through sub-franchising. Meanwhile the United Kingdom and Ireland have over 1200 Domino’s locations making it Europe’s largest Domino’s market.

When Domino’s first arrived in Italy seven years ago it tried to differentiate itself from the country’s traditional pizza producers by offering a full home delivery service and a menu that included US-style toppings like pineapple. During the pandemic however it faced rising competition as local eateries joined meal delivery services such as Deliveroo and Just Eat. The firm also faced more competition as traditional eateries began using delivery applications.

As part of the bankruptcy procedure the company was granted 90 days of protection from its creditors. However the said protection expired last month. The Italian company has already begun to reduce its operations from its peak in 2020 with deliveries ceasing at the end of July.

After learning that the fast-food giant was leaving Italy some social media users celebrated. A journalist shared their sentiments saying it’s a wonder Dominos could survive in New Jersey let alone in Italy the birthplace of pizza. On top of that another tweet compared opening Domino’s in Italy to selling snow at the North Pole.

Hence hurry and answer the survey on Domino’s Pizza’s pulling out of Italy on the Real Research app from August 13 2022. After that you will receive 25 TNCs as a reward.

Reading up on Domino’s shopping guides is like having your own personal product concierge. We do the tedious part—deep-dive research hands-on testing and tapping experts for advice—so all you have to do is hit “add to cart.” That’s why we call them Simply the Best.

Leigh Jerrard of Greywater Corps a California-based irrigation installer argues that anyone with a roof and a garden—or those simply interested in living more sustainably—should consider investing in a rain barrel. And while he may personally be most familiar with systems that can hold as much as 500 to 5000 gallons of runoff (!) you don’t have to default to something so oversize from the start. Our best rain barrel picks below are small enough to set up on your own.

Our Favorites

Rainwater Collection Urn Gardener’s Supply ($199) Shop

Gallons: 50 | Material: Plastic | Height: 45 inches

What we like: Chic body

Overflow valve

Brass spigot

Complimentary 5-foot hose Worth noting: Some assembly required

Why we chose it: A ceramic look alike that’s actually durable plastic.

Add some leafy greens or floral friends on the top of this rain barrel and you might just fool people into thinking it’s an extra-tall terracotta pot. The shapely silhouette is actually made from a UV- scratch- and chip-resistant polyethylene (just a fancy way to say tough plastic) which mimics a matte finish to play up the disguise. Beneath the removable decorative lid is a screen guard to keep out bugs and allow air to still freely flow (no mold or algae to worry about here). It tops our list for its attractive exterior and equally functional features.

Best Slim: Bosmere Slim Rain Barrel

Shop

Gallons: 26 | Material: Plastic | Height: 38 inches

What we like: Earthy green colorway

Great for small spaces

Complimentary stand Worth noting: May easily overflow

Why we chose it: This compact container will still catch enough runoff to water your garden.

If you’re not looking for anything too grandiose or simply don’t have the space for anything larger than a foot or so in diameter might we direct you to the Bosmere? Described by veteran features and garden editor Melissa Ozawa as “tall and svelte” you can squeeze this slender vessel into many a tight backyard corner and still repurpose 26 gallons of gray water. A lockable lid keeps things secure from curious critters and it ships with a compatible easy-assembly stand that lifts the unit off the ground an extra 11 inches. That way you don’t have to finagle your watering can underneath the spout; simply turn the tap and fill. Sadly we’ve noticed it’s often in-and-out-of-stock.

Best Recycled: Earthminded Drainable Rain Station

Plastic Drainable Planter Rain Barrel and Hose Earthminded ($123) Shop

Gallons: 45 | Material: Plastic | Height: 35 inches

What we like: Easy to install

Includes a diverter

Made in the U.S. Worth noting: Plastic spigot

On the heavy side

Why we chose it: Made from up to 85 percent recycled food-grade resin.

You’ll need a drill to attach this standard rain barrel to your home’s downspout install the complimentary diverter and attach the hose—but it’s all worth it. Choose between a black or terracotta exterior both of which would look great against the backdrop of a home with dark siding. It also comes with a water hole cover so as soon as the temperatures dip you can plug up the hole to prevent expansion from ice and detach the barrel to safely store it indoors. And much like our top pick we love that the lid on this model is reversible which means you can plant anything from flowers to herbs to trailing ivy on top.

Best Upcycled: Mirainbarrel Whiskey Barrel

Whiskey/Bourbon Barrel Rain Barrel Home Depot ($477) Shop

Gallons: 53 | Material: Wood | Height: Varies

What we like: Natural white oak

Complete with a sealed system

Returnable in 90 days

Compatible with a standard garden hose Worth noting: Should be installed by a professional (but coordination is free!)

Why we chose it: A real-deal barrel upgraded to catch more rain.

To be honest there are a lot of rain barrels on the market that try to look like a wood barrel but they’re generally made from plastic. If this is the sort of farmhouse-y aesthetic you’re going for why not try the real deal? Buy a barrel that in another life held whiskey and bourbon instead of rain. Yet this isn’t your basic barrel—it’s backed by a patented overflow prevention system and rust-proof ports; comes with a diverter and hole saw; and is a breeze to winterize. And there’s no concern about it weathering outdoors where it’ll be exposed to the elements since it already ships with a unique patina.

Best Collapsible: LOSTRONAUT Collapsible Rain Barrel

Portable Rain Barrel Water Tank LOSTRONAUT ($56 was $70) Shop

Gallons: 53 | Material: Vinyl | Height: 27.5 inches

What we like: Less than $100

Lightweight

Foldable design Worth noting: Not as sturdy compared to others on this list

Why we chose it: Simple and sleek this will pack up into a storage bag.

If you don’t want to mess with a crazy winterizing routine then this collapsible rain barrel is for you. It folds up all neat and compact small enough to store away like a lawn chair. In fact you could bring it out just for when a storm is about to roll through rather than leave it out all day every day. It comes with the bells and whistles you’d expect of the best rain barrel too: an overflow pipe two spigots and a nylon mesh screen to prevent bacteria growth. While it may feel flimsy when you first install it (it’s only 5 pounds altogether) previous owners and reviewers agree it becomes sturdier the more it’s filled.

We Also Liked

The Great American Rain Barrel ($159) is actually a repurposed food container that can hold up to 60 gallons of runoff though a diverter (large or small) will cost you extra.

Great American Rain Barrel ($159) is actually a repurposed food container that can hold up to 60 gallons of runoff though a diverter (large or small) will cost you extra. There are color choices galore from the Impressions Plastic Drainable Rain Barrel ($484). Paired with a brass spigot and a whopping 90-gallon capacity the only feature we weren’t totally sold on was the faux roughened exterior.

How We Chose These Products

We tapped Ozawa to scour the market for the best (and best-looking) rain barrels then rounded out the selections with other choices from Domino editors. Our picks speak to the size of your household and general living situation as well as offer a range of materials in addition to the standard plastic. For a greater understanding of the topic (what should you really look for in the best rain barrel?) we reached out to Greywater Corps’s Jerrard who has plenty of experience in establishing stormwater irrigation systems throughout California. We also spoke with Hippo consumer trends expert Courtney Klosterman about insurance and liability associated with this product and keeping their intel in mind we then made sure our picks deter algae and bugs.

Our Shopping Checklist

Purpose

“As we continue to experience extreme droughts and water rationing is put into place rain barrels are a great way to collect fresh free rainwater to use for outdoor purposes” offers Klosterman. “Not only will this save money and energy but it can protect the environment.” A rain barrel connects to downspouts to collect runoff and it includes a spigot that a hose can hook up to or fill a watering can. And it’s an essential part of your potential rainscaping plan. You’ll just need to make sure you’re allowed to use one first Kolsterman advises: “Some locations throughout the U.S. require permits for rainwater harvesting or prohibit rain barrels outright while others may offer financial incentives.”

Location

After confirming it’s A-OK to set up a rain barrel in your neighborhood the next step is figuring out the best place to position it. “Start by looking at downspout locations—it’s easiest to divert water into barrels if they’re close to downspouts” advises Jerrard. “Additionally we look for level unobstructed areas near gardens or plants that will appreciate the water. We also try to find unused spaces like side-yard setbacks so you’re not occupying outdoor living areas.”

Size and Volume

Our list of the best rain barrels definitely skews on the smaller side but it can be intimidating to install anything larger than 100 gallons. And in general this is still a ton of rainwater. For those living in the drier parts of the country being able to capture as much water as possible makes sense but for everyone else it isn’t totally necessary. A smaller barrel say between 20 and 90 gallons may not be the greatest at optimal water capture but it’s less likely to become a prominent eyesore in your backyard.

Material

“The cheapest and sturdiest material is polyethylene—these tanks will last a lifetime but not everyone likes the aesthetic” shares Jerrard. “Galvanized steel tanks are beautiful and range in size from a few hundred to thousands of gallons.”

And while Jerrard isn’t the biggest fan of wood recycled oak wine or whiskey barrels are still a suitable vessel—they just may wear a little quicker in the elements (especially if you happen to live somewhere that experiences extreme changes in temperature).

Ask Domino

Q: Should I worry about my rain barrel attracting bugs?

“Not if they’re installed properly! You want to make sure all points of access are screened with fine mesh—inlet and overflow” offers Jerrard. “If this is done correctly you’ll have no problem with mosquitoes. Monitoring and maintenance is also key to check any pooling water or decomposing leaf mulch.”

Q: Can a rain barrel overflow? What happens if it does?

“All tanks will fill up and overflow at some point” shares Jerrard. “It’s important to direct this water to a safe place away from building foundations and hopefully somewhere it can percolate back into the land—unless flooding or erosion is a concern in which case you should direct it to the street.”

Q: Do I need to clean my rain barrel?

You should be keeping tabs on your gutters more so than your rain barrel. “Clean gutters are vital to ensuring not only the health of exterior surfaces around your home but even your foundation walls. Clogs in your gutters can result in immeasurable damage over time especially during heavy rainfalls” Klosterman points out. “Checking this item off your home maintenance checklist is definitely worth the effort.”

The Last Word

The best rain barrels according to Jerrard “save water reduce stormwater runoff and can be a source of emergency drinking water.” But they don’t have to be an eyesore.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmV5Y29udHJvbC5jb20vbmV3cy90cmVuZHMvbWFuLXNoYXJlcy1waWNzLW9mLWRvbWlub3MtZnJlc2gtcGl6emEtYW1vbmctbW9wcy10d2l0dGVyLWlzLWFnaGFzdC05MDI3NTExLmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25leWNvbnRyb2wuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRzL21hbi1zaGFyZXMtcGljcy1vZi1kb21pbm9zLWZyZXNoLXBpenphLWFtb25nLW1vcHMtdHdpdHRlci1pcy1hZ2hhc3QtOTAyNzUxMS5odG1sL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man shares pics of 'Domino's fresh pizza' among mops. Twitter is aghast,"Photos of the pizza dough stored among cleaning mops shared by Sahil Karnany on Twitter.

A Domino's representative told Moneycontrol ""The issue is a month old and action has been taken as per the company protocols."" In a statement the company stated ""Domino's adheres to world-class protocols for ensuring the highest standards of hygiene and food safety.""

""An incident involving one of our stores was recently brought to our notice.

If not you may find yourself reminded on a national podcast by a four-time NBA Champion.

That is where Klay Thompson finds himself currently after teammate Draymond Green chose his eponymously titled podcast to notify the world of the arrears.

'Every now and then Klay and I play dominos' Green told his audience.

'Klay has the attention span of a two-year-old so he can only really sit for one game of dominos.'

Draymond Green has become a national off-the-court figure thanks to his own podcast

'In fact if you guys watch this if you got Klay's Twitter you can hit him up and remind him that he owes me $3000.

'I accept Cash App I don't have Venmo but I do have Apple Pay and I also have Zelle. Y'all can remind him he owes me $3000. I'd appreciate it.'

Green also lifted the lid on his flight rituals. Despite the Warriors already spending so much time together the big three choose to sit themselves together each and every flight.

'I sit with Klay and Steph. We sit at this little table away from everybody else -- nah I'm just playing' Green said.

'We talk sometimes we sleep sometimes. Klay is very childish so Klay will throw stuff at people like skittles and popcorn and then do the whole close his eye thing and act like one of us threw it.

Klay Thompson has enjoyed his offseason as a four-time NBA champion including at the ESPYs

'That's Klay so you get a little glimpse of sitting with Klay.'

Green also revealed the trio avoid confrontation more often that not despite the brutally competitive natures of Thompson Curry and particularly No. 23.

'Honestly we haven't had a ton of arguments because it's just not kind of how the personalities match up' he said.

'I usually do most of the yelling and most of the time they'll usually ignore me to the point where if I'm yelling and then one of them yell back I'm not gonna get into a screaming match with one of them.

'So at the point when I say something and they disagree and say something back then they said something back and that's just is what it is.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYnJhbmRjcnVuY2guY29tLm5nLzIwMjIvMDgvMTMvZG9taW5vcy1waXp6YS1pbnRyb2R1Y2VkLW5ldy1zd2VldC1jaGlsbGktY2hpY2tlbi1waXp6YS_SAWJodHRwczovL2JyYW5kY3J1bmNoLmNvbS5uZy8yMDIyLzA4LzEzL2RvbWlub3MtcGl6emEtaW50cm9kdWNlZC1uZXctc3dlZXQtY2hpbGxpLWNoaWNrZW4tcGl6emEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino’s Pizza introduced NEW SWEET CHILLI CHICKEN PIZZA,"

But the supporting cast are given plenty to do as well including character actor Michael McKean who plays Chuck McGill.

One of the subplots of the show follows Chuck's obsessive compulsive order (OCD) a mental illness where people suffer from intrusive thoughts and compulsions. For Chuck that manifests as the belief that he is sensitive to electrical charges and subsequently coming up with rituals to deal with that including insisting on removing anything which might carry a charge.

In a new video on her YouTube channel licensed therapist Georgia Dow explains that while these rituals originate as a way of lowering anxiety and calming the individual they don't stay that way.

""The problem with OCD is that it can grow out of hand very very quickly"" she says. ""It usually starts with something small a thought or idea. What you're usually trying to do is control the uncontrollable.""

""And that's what makes OCD so difficult to deal with is that you have to deal with all those intrusive negative thought spirals and then you have to do exposure and response prevention"" Dow continues. ""Go towards things that make you feel uncomfortable and then slowly don't do those safety behaviors or rituals that have made you feel safe. You need really good coping mechanisms because you're going to feel worse before you feel better.""

While Better Call Saul utilizes obsessive compulsive disorder for both comedic and dramatic effect Dow credits the show with still largely treating it seriously and realistically and demonstrating just how drastically it can affect a person's life—not to mention everyone around them.

She focuses on one particular scene which does a good job of illustrating the techniques that people can use to prevent themselves from becoming overwhelmed: when Chuck tries to enter the supermarket he names the things he can see as a way of calming himself and interrupting those intrusive thoughts. If this were real life however Dow would have advised going in getting one item and then leaving and trying again the next day.

""It takes a lot of work because you need to do the journaling you need to deal with the thoughts and you need to deal with the rituals"" she says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbGVhdmUtaXQtdG8tYmVhdmVyLWluc2lkZS10b255LWRvdy1qZXJyeS1tYXRoZXJzLWZyaWVuZHNoaXAuaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Leave It to Beaver': Inside Tony Dow and Jerry Mathers' Friendship,"'Leave It to Beaver' star Jerry Mathers is mourning the death of his co-star and friend Tony Dow.

Leave It to Beaver fans are mourning the death of Tony Dow. The actor best known for his role as Wally Cleaver on the classic TV series died on July 27 2022. Among those grieving are Dow’s co-star and friend Jerry Mathers.

‘Leave It to Beaver star Jerry Mathers mourns friend and co-star Tony Dow

Dow and Mathers rose to fame as brothers Wally and Theodore “The Beaver” Cleaver on the classic sitcom. Just like their onscreen characters Dow and Mathers had a tight bond. Their friendship spanned over six decades and sadly ended with Dow’s death.

Dow died at the age of 77 on July 27 and immediately friends responded with condolences. In a Facebook post Mathers described Dow as “generous loving sincere and humble.” Mathers’ heartfelt message also reflected on the pair’s friendship “He was not only my brother on TV but in many ways in life as well. Tony leaves an empty place in my heart that won’t be filled.”

Tony Dow and Jerry Mathers rose to fame on ‘Leave It to Beaver’

In 1957 Dow and Mathers’ lives changed forever when they were cast on Leave It to Beaver. The sitcom revolved around the picture-perfect family The Cleavers. Ward and June Cleaver (Hugh Beaumont and Barbara Billingsley) are loving parents who instill important life lessons to their sons. In every episode Wally and Beaver land into trouble which ends in a lecture from their parents.

Mathers was nine when he joined the show and Dow was 12 years old. The sitcom became an instant success and launched the cast into stardom. The cast was as close onscreen as they were offscreen. According to Outsider.com Mathers said he and Dow hit it off from the start and he admired his co-star’s athleticism.

“Tony was a great athlete. I’m the oldest in my family so I never had a big brother. But Dow was an AUU swimming and diving champion.”

The actors took different career paths after the show ended

Leave It to Beaver ran for one year on CBS before being picked up by ABC where it gained a huge following. After a successful six-season run the show aired its final episode on June 20 1963. Following the show’s end Dow and Mathers took different career paths.

Mathers retired from acting to concentrate on high school and later enlisted in the United States Air Force Reserve. Later the actor would graduate from the University of California Berkley with a degree in philosophy. Mathers worked as a loan officer and a real estate developer. However he did return to acting with guest appearances on Married…with Children and The Love Boat.

As for Dow he continued working in Hollywood as an actor director and writer. Some of his other acting credits include The Kentucky Fried Movie and Back to the Beach. Aside from acting Dow was a well-known sculptor whose art was featured in numerous exhibits.

Dow and Mathers would team up for several appearances later in their careers. They performed together in dinner theater and in 1980 made a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live. In 1983 they reprised their roles as Wally And Beaver for the TV movie Still the Beaver and the TV reboot The New Leave It to Beaver.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9pbnZlc3Rpbmcvc3RvY2tzLXdlZWstYWhlYWQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDgvMTQvaW52ZXN0aW5nL3N0b2Nrcy13ZWVrLWFoZWFk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robinhood may need to join forces with a larger Wall Street rival,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

New York CNN Business —

Robinhood as its name suggests was designed to take the power of the stock market away from the rich fat cats on Wall Street and hand it over to regular people.

Now ironically Robinhood may need to join forces with one of the very titans of Wall Street that the stock and crypto trading company was trying to unseat.

Robinhood reported a big loss a drop in active users and its second round of layoffs of 2022 in early August. The stock which went public a little more than a year ago is down more than 40% this year and is trading nearly 75% below its initial public offering price.

“They are having to make grown-up business decisions such as cost reductions and moving out of growth mode” said Hugh Tallents a partner with consulting firm cg42. “It’s becoming clear that they once had unbelievable user growth but they also had a valuation that was insane.”

All of this raises the question of whether Robinhood may need to sell itself to a bigger financial services firm. Speculation about a possible deal has increased in recent months after crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried the CEO of unicorn brokerage firm FTX bought a stake in Robinhood.

Bankman-Fried has denied having any interest in a full-blown FTX takeover of Robinhood. Robinhood had no comment after the merger chatter first circulated.

But competition is fierce in the online brokerage world. Robinhood competes with Wall Street giants like Fidelity Charles Schwab (SCHW) which also owns TD Ameritrade and E-Trade parent Morgan Stanley (MS). And it also has to contend with crypto brokerage Coinbase as well as upstarts like SoFi eToro and WeBull. (Coinbase incidentally got a recent boost after announcing a partnership with Wall Street giant BlackRock.)

Tallents said he does not think a large Wall Street brokerage would want to bet on Robinhood because of the risk involved. He noted that Robinhood customers tend to be younger and have less money to invest so an acquirer “would need to play a long game and hope they get more affluent.”

Tallents told CNN Business in February that he thought Robinhood could be a good fit for Venmo owner PayPal (PYPL) and he still believes that such a deal makes sense at some point down the road.

The good news for Robinhood though is that despite the short-term concerns the company still has a solid enough financial cushion to keep it afloat for the foreseeable future. Robinhood ended the second quarter with $6 billion on its balance sheet down from $6.2 billion in March. So Tallents said the situation isn’t dire yet.

Still Robinhood will need to prove to investors that it can get its growth rate back on track on its own. If not expect more calls for the company to put itself on the shopping block.

All eyes on the consumer

Is the economy heading to (or is it already in) a recession? Upcoming earnings from some of America’s biggest retailers will provide more clues.

Walmart (WMT) which already warned in late July that profits will be below forecasts officially reports its latest results on Tuesday. The Walmart (WMT) warning sent a chill throughout the retail sector and it didn’t help that Best Buy (BBY) also issued its own dour sales outlook.

The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) is down more than 20% this year a bigger drop than the broader market. Wall Street is clearly anxious about the health of the American consumer.

Investors will be eager to hear if Walmart is a bit more upbeat about the rest of 2022 given that inflation pressures have started to ease. Wall Street will also be paying close attention to top Walmart rival Target (TGT).

Some analysts think that discount retailers like Walmart and Target could soon rebound.

“Gas prices are beginning to decline the pull of superstores has an added value in times of inflation and even inventory issues could be a short-term blessing as the push to keep prices low for those products aligns well with trading-down behavior” said Placer.ai a firm that analyzes foot traffic trends at retailers in a blog post this week.

TJ Maxx and Marshalls owner TJX (TJX) as well as Kohl’s (KSS) will report their latest results this week. So are Home Depot (HD) and Lowe’s (LOW) which could provide more color about the health of the housing market as well as broader consumer spending trends.

Wall Street will also be paying attention to the government’s latest reading on retail sales for July. Consumers spent more money in June largely due to inflation pushing up prices. Retail sales rose 1% from May but economists surveyed by Reuters are expecting retail sales to climb just 0.2% from June to July.

The availability of tax credits could change within the span of the next few days now that the House has passed the bill if President Biden signs it quickly.

Major Update: The bill has been signed. It is now law. Click through for information on the new EV Tax Credit.

If you’re looking to buy an EV soon check below to see how various manufacturers will be affected by these changes and what you can do to try to ensure access.

While the bill improves the EV tax credit in many ways including making it available at the point of sale and removing the 200k credit cap per manufacturer and extending availability for 10 years there are some confusing changes that have caused a rush within the EV community to try to take advantage of the credits before they go away.

At issue is a provision that states the new credit is only available to EVs that go through final assembly in North America – intended to encourage onshoring of manufacturing. Unlike other aspects of the new tax credit which mostly start at the beginning of 2023 the assembly requirement goes into place immediately upon enactment of the law.

But the law includes a “transition rule” which states any EV with a “written binding contract to purchase” signed before the date of the law’s enactment will be able to take the old credit if the buyer so chooses even if the car is delivered after the bill is signed. This is covered on page 393-394 of the bill. We don’t know when the bill will be signed but it could happen within days.

(Note: this means that a buyer who signs a binding purchase agreements today can if they choose treat the credit as if they bought the car today with all of the current rules for the “old” credit – you can’t mix and match certain rules you either get all the provisions of the old one or of the new one)

Because of this some EV manufacturers are offering binding purchase agreements to lock in credit availability for cars that are assembled outside North America or which run afoul of the new bill’s price cap.

Here’s our best understanding of the situation broken down for each manufacturer that is likely to be at least partially negatively affected (i.e. not counting Ford which is US-based and GM and Tesla which can only benefit since they’re currently out of credits anyway etc.). We’re mostly focusing on BEV models here but have mentioned a few PHEVs as well.

Major Update: NADA the national automobile dealer’s association has sent out a notice to dealers with guidance about the final assembly/binding agreement clauses of the bill so this information should start percolating to any dealers who are in contact with NADA.

Rivian tax credits

Rivian should have an easier time of it than Fisker given that its vehicles are assembled in the US and therefore will not be disqualified the moment the bill is enacted. But some configurations of Rivian’s trucks do fall afoul of the price caps which the bill sets at $80k for trucks and SUVs which is further complicated by Rivian’s price hike and subsequent reversal for early orders.

Unlike the North American assembly provision the bill’s price caps don’t go into effect immediately; instead as best we can tell they go into effect at the beginning of next year. At that point any Rivian over $80k will no longer qualify for the credit (which Rivian isn’t happy about).

But regardless of this the transition rule triggers as soon as the bill is signed so you should still attempt to convert to a binding reservation ASAP if you think you might end up in one of the bill’s edge cases next year (e.g. taking delivery of an 80k+ Rivian next year or if you have income over 150k single/300k jointly).

Update: Rivian is sending out emails to customers today so check your email if you have a Rivian reservation (here’s a copy of the email and of Rivian’s binding contract to purchase). It also posted a support response on its website. In short customers can convert $100 worth of their reservation into a non-refundable binding reservation fee on request.

Fisker tax credits

The upcoming Fisker Ocean should start deliveries by the end of this year but since it’s assembled in Austria by Magna it will lose access to EV tax credits as soon as the new bill is enacted.

Fisker put out a press release inviting reservation holders to convert their $250/$100 reservation fees to non-refundable orders. This won’t cost anything but it does make your reservation fee non-refundable. Get in touch with your Fisker contact now if you have a reservation but still want access to the tax credit.

Lucid tax credits

Lucid is in a similar situation as Rivian in that the cars are assembled in the US and currently ramping up in production but it runs afoul of the bill’s $55k price cap for cars. As a result Lucid buyers will lose access to the EV tax credit when the price caps go into place but not immediately when the bill is signed – though a binding agreement must still be signed before the bill is signed in order to qualify for the “old” tax credit.

Update: Lucid has contacted reservation holders and given the option of converting their $1000/$300 reservation fee into a non-refundable deposit and binding agreement to purchase the car. Check your email or log in to your Lucid account then go to your “designs and orders tab.” Lucid has also sent out an email to their customer interest list informing potential customers of the same.

Polestar tax credits

The Polestar 3 will be manufactured in the USA but the all-electric Polestar 2 is not. As a result the Polestar 2 will lose access to EV tax credits but the Polestar 3 might qualify when it hits the road in the future depending on if it stays under the $80k SUV price cap and sources its batteries properly.

We reached out to Polestar and got this response:

Polestar is closely monitoring the developments in the United States Congress regarding changes to the Electric Vehicle Tax credit. We will have more information to share if and when the proposed legislation passes through the House of Representatives.

Polestar added that the reason for its delay is that it wants to be completely certain that it can deliver on any promises it makes to customers and currently due to the developing nature of the bill and the public’s understanding of it it is not fully confident in that.

Unfortunately this approach means that Polestar will have even less time to react if and when the House passes the bill and before Biden signs it which could happen in a matter of days. So for Polestar buyers who are waiting for a car they configured to ship be ready get in contact with Polestar or your dealer to try to figure out what to do and hopefully Polestar will be able develop a process for this before the bill is signed. We’ll update this article if anything changes.

Polestar does have limited availability of pre-configured Polestar 2 vehicles for purchase at its dealerships which are sparsely distributed throughout the nation. You can also try to get one from an independent dealer because a few have been available at non-Polestar dealers.

Hyundai tax credits

Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 is available right now and buyers could conceivably find one at dealerships today but stock is low and demand is high so some who have ordered are still waiting for their car to be delivered.

Hyundai is not happy to be left out of the new EV tax credit and told us that they’re working with dealers and customers to try to offer a purchase agreement:

Hyundai has recently announced US investments of $10B including EV manufacturing in Alabama and Georgia. We are disappointed that the current legislation severely limits EV access and options for Americans and may dramatically slow the transition to sustainable mobility in this market. HMA and GMA are fully supporting our dealers to assist consumers with accessing the currently available tax credit through appropriate processes and purchase agreements.

If you have an Ioniq 5 on order reach out to your dealer to see if you can get a purchase agreement signed. If you want an Ioniq 5 check your local dealer inventory and if you’re lucky enough to find one see if you can buy within the week.

Genesis tax credits

Since Genesis is Hyundai’s luxury brand it offered the same statement as Hyundai above. The Genesis GV60 has recently started deliveries in the US but it’s still selling in relatively low numbers so far.

That said there seem to be several GV60s in stock on Genesis’ website so check your local dealer inventory and you might be able to find one available for purchase right away.

Kia tax credits

Kia is in a similar situation as Hyundai with the EV6 on the road but still available in low numbers due to high demand and low supply.

We didn’t hear back from Kia by press time but since Kia and Hyundai are closely related companies we hope its reaction and processes will be similar and that it is talking with its dealers about solutions now. Reach out to your dealer if you have one on order.

If you want an EV6 and don’t have one on order yet check your local dealer inventory and if you find one see if you can buy within the week.

VW tax credits

The VW ID.4 is an interesting case because it’s already out in numbers here in the US but we’ve heard from several readers that some cars are being shipped to the US right now with owners waiting for delivery. Anyone in that situation should make sure they have a binding purchase agreement signed with their dealer especially if delivery is imminent.

But this is only relevant for this model year because the 2023 ID.4 will be built in the US at VW’s Chattanooga TN plant. So really the only people in danger of losing EV tax credits on the ID.4 are those who are currently waiting on a 2022 model to ship from Germany.

That said the 2023 ID.4 gets some new features and a small price hike (along with a lower base price due to a new smaller battery option) so if you want the 2022 model without those new features and with the larger battery check your local dealer inventory for a 2022 ID.4 and buy this week.

Update: VW sent out a letter to ID.4 reservation holders detailing the act and suggesting that customers contact dealerships if they want to sign a binding agreement. However we’ve heard that some dealers are being swamped by calls and feel they cannot issue an agreement unless they have a VIN. Here’s a forum post with some customers’ experiences.

Nissan tax credits

Nissan’s upcoming Ariya is being assembled in Japan but isn’t being sold in the US yet. Further the company is very close to hitting the 200k cap on the “old” EV tax credit.

This leads to an interesting situation where buyers signing a binding purchase agreement today could conceivably still qualify for the “old” tax credit when they take delivery of an Ariya but only if that delivery takes place before the “old” tax credit ramps down due to the company hitting the 200k cap. This and the Toyota bZ4X (which just hit the 200k cap) are the only vehicles for which this is the case.

So oddly enough the cap and ramp-down period might still remain relevant for this car.

Update: Nissan has sent out an “agreement to purchase” to Ariya reservation holders stating that they believe the bill could be signed into law “as early as August 13.” Check your email if you have an Ariya reservation.

The Leaf is readily available but since it’s assembled in Smyrna TN it will still qualify for the new tax credit (and since the 200k cap is removed by the bill you don’t have to worry about that either) so if you want a Leaf there’s no rush.

Toyota (and Subaru) tax credits

We didn’t originally cover Toyota or Subaru in this post since their BEVs are currently under an indefinite recall and are not being sold. But after hearing from many RAV4 Prime buyers (and some Subaru hybrid buyers) we wanted to add a note.

Toyota is in an interesting situation because it just hit the 200k cap which means its credits were scheduled to start gradually sundowning over the next year or so. On October 1st cars were planned to no longer get the full $7500 credit and would get $3750 instead. Subaru hasn’t hit the cap so Subaru buyers don’t have to worry about that part.

However due to the new law’s final assembly provision all of Toyota and Subaru’s PHEVs and EVs will be made ineligible for credits when the bill is signed unless buyers have a binding purchase contract in hand.

RAV4 Prime buyers have been finding that their dealerships do not have a process through which to sign a binding purchase contract or otherwise have not heard about the changes in this bill. For anyone who is in this situation try talking to your dealer and let them know about the binding purchase contract provision. They should already know about the Sept 30 deadline before the credit gets halved. We’ve also got an email out to Toyota to see if it has any comment.

And if you have a Solterra or bZ4X on order then between an indefinite recall and a confusing change to tax credits and only a month and a half until the old credits get cut in half anyway well uh… good luck.

Update: Toyota has sent out notice to its Toyota/Lexus Dealer Advocacy Network with guidance telling dealers to let customers sign a “Buyer’s Order” before Monday August 15 when they expect the bill to be signed. If dealers have any questions they should contact their district manager.

BMW tax credits

BMW has a diverse lineup of PHEVs and EVs with various US availability and NA-assembly status. Without digging into the weeds in general BMW’s EVs are built outside of the US but some of its PHEVs are built here.

As a result most BMWs will lose access to credits right away when the bill is enacted but some of its US-assembled PHEVs might actually get larger credits.

BMW’s i7 is still on pre-order so if you’re looking for that car you’ll have to contact BMW to see if you can get a purchase agreement but the iX and i4 are available in dealerships. If you’re interested in either of those click through to check local dealerships for the BMW i4 or the BMW iX.

And credits are perhaps most relevant for the Mini Cooper SE BMW’s lowest price electric offering for which the tax credit makes up a big chunk of the purchase price. These have been available at dealers for some time so if you were thinking of getting one check your local dealer inventory now.

Audi tax credits

Audi has several vehicles over the price cap and all are assembled outside the US. Most of its EVs are available from dealerships now though so you don’t have to mess around with pre-orders or custom builds to take advantage of the EV tax credit. We reached out to Audi who did not have a comment at this time.

If you’re looking for an Audi EV click to check your local dealer inventory for an Audi e-tron an Audi Q4 e-tron or Audi e-tron GT.

Porsche tax credits

While Taycan buyers are less likely to really need access to this tax credit in order to make their $90k+ car affordable surely everyone would like to save money if possible. Taycans are both built outside the US and are over the price cap and therefore won’t qualify once the bill goes into effect.

A Porsche dealer told us new Taycans are currently preordered about a year ahead of time (Porsches have lots of options for customization so owners like to get exactly what they ordered). The dealer said it isn’t aware of any method to offer a purchase agreement that far in advance.

But every once in a while dealers do have a new Taycan on the lot so if you’re thinking about getting one check your local dealer inventory for a new Taycan and get it this week.

Mercedes tax credits

Like the Porsche Taycan the Mercedes EQS is both foreign-assembled and above the new bill’s price cap. But unlike the Taycan Mercedes seems to have quite a lot of EQS inventory available at dealerships.

If you want to save a small chunk of the EQS’ six-figure base price check your local dealer inventory and go snatch one up.

As for the upcoming Mercedes EQB which should start deliveries very soon if you have one on order you might try to get your dealer to offer you a binding sales contract. We’ve heard from at least one customer who said their dealer had no idea this was happening.

Update: Mercedes got back to us with a (pretty noncomittal) statement. We’ll let you know if we hear more.

We are reviewing the proposal in anticipation of the new provisions becoming final in the coming week. Independent of these proposals Mercedes-Benz is fully committed to an electric future.

Volvo tax credits

Volvo’s all-electric “Recharge” models seem to be reasonably available – we found a couple all-electric C40 Recharges at our local dealer but no XC40 Recharge. We also found several of Volvo’s PHEV models which will lose access to credits due to overseas final assembly (except the S60 which is assembled in South Carolina).

Update: Volvo has sent notice out to its dealers indicating that the situation “remains very fluid” and that “The Volvo team continues to evaluate the situation is working with lawmakers and hopes to clarify the legislation’s language so the intent of the bill is fully realized – to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles in the United States.” They then referred dealers to the NADA email mentioned above. Volvo does not seem to have a process in place for binding purchase agreements at the moment.

So like the rest of the cars on this list if you’re looking to buy any of Volvo’s EV or PHEV models (say it with us now) check your local dealer inventory and hope you can get one right away.

Other automakers?

We reached out to all of the above automakers for comment but as of press time we hadn’t heard back from all of them (we’ll update this article whenever we learn more).

If you’re a buyer who is planning to buy an EV that might lose access to the old tax credit (assembled outside North America over the $55k car/$80k SUV/truck price cap) but are waiting for delivery and haven’t yet signed a contract check in with your dealer or the manufacturer about the possibility of signing a contract early.

If you have questions about another automaker we haven’t listed here or if you find out more than we know in this article feel free to drop us an email."

Someday.

She just didn’t think it would happen so fast in spring 2021 not long after she turned 60. And she never thought her Florida relocation would take place in a custom-built home designed to provide private quarters for three generations. There’s the middle generation — Markell now 62 and her husband Don Markell 75. The couple is sandwiched by their son Spencer Markell 27 and Janice’s mom Edna Smith 92.

“It never occurred to me we would make this move with my mom” Markell says. “But then the lockdown happened. And everything changed.”

The Markells bought a Stock Development spec house in the Lake Club in Lakewood Ranch in August 2020 for $1.05 million. The foundation was laid when they bought it and it was move-in ready for the family seven months later. The 3100-square-foot house (about 4000 square feet when including the lanai) was essentially if not evenly split into three wings one for each generation. Edna Smith had her own living room bedroom and bathroom and Spencer had his own sitting room bedroom and bathroom.

While Spencer has since moved into his own home in Myakka City the Markells’ move represents a rapidly growing trend in Lakewood Ranch and the surrounding area: multigenerational living when grandparents parents and children live in the same home (or at least two of the three).

The number of Americans who live in multigenerational family households is about four times larger than in the 1970s according to a March Pew Research Center report. As of March 2021 there were 59.7 million U.S. residents who lived with multiple generations under one roof.

“It’s certainly becoming more prevalent” says Derek Nelson franchise owner with AR Homes Sarasota/Nelson Homes. “We’ve seen a lot of this and have been designing that kind of home for more and more people.”

David Hunihan a longtime Lakewood Ranch homebuilder and CEO of Lee Wetherington Homes has seen the trend bubbling up for years but of late multigenerational housing he says has “become more culturally acceptable.”

“You see kids living with their parents longer” Hunihan adds “and parents making conscious decisions to buy a house to live with their kids.”

Both A.R. Homes and Lee Wetherington Homes are approved builders in one of the newest communities in Lakewood Ranch to promote multigenerational housing Star Farms at Lakewood Ranch. John Cannon Homes is another builder at Star Farms a 700-acre gated community with room for 1500 residences in a mix of homes villas and townhomes. Amenities for Star Farms in the northeast section of Lakewood Ranch between State Road 64 and 44th Avenue East are planned to include a club fitness center resort-style pool dog park an event lawn and trails.

The developer of Star Farms is Forestar Group a subsidiary of D.R. Horton that has projects in 55 markets in 23 states and delivered nearly 17000 lots in 2021. Construction of Star Farms where D.R. Horton is also a builder got underway in early 2021. Plans include nearly 300 homes in the first phase with up to 25 floor plans.

“Builders have designed floor plans that allow residents to balance togetherness and privacy” Forestar West Florida Division President Tony Squitieri says in an email response to questions.

As of mid-June A.R. Homes had sold three homes in Star Farms and a fourth was under contract — all in the $2.5 million to $3.5 million range Nelson says. While none of those homes was built specifically to cater to multiple generations Nelson says the topic has come up often in conversations with clients. Ditto for Hunihan.

Nelson and Hunihan both say at the price level of custom homes multigenerational floor plans and designs for the most part are there for the asking. “As a custom builder we can handle virtually any custom size house” Hunihan says “as long as we can fit it in the home site and it fits the budget.”

Builders note several reasons for the surge in multigenerational housing. Three of the big ones says Squitieri are developing closer family relationships; increased living costs; and aging-at-home trends for seniors.

“Multigenerational living offers families convenient places and activities to interact with one another and helps mitigate rising living and health care costs” Squitieri says.

That’s certainly true with the Markells in the Lake Club. Janice Markell says the emotional scars of having her mom in an assisted living facility during heavy Northeast lockdowns were raw. It motivated the family to think about Florida fast — a decision they don’t regret.

“The only way this move could work would be if my mom could stay with us” Markell says. “This fit our family perfectly.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuai5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9jb21tdW5pdHkvMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9zcmMtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQta2pzLWZyaWVkLWtpdGNoZW4tdG9wLXBlbnNhY29sYS1zdG9yaWVzLzEwMjY2OTQ3MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SRC development KJ's Fried Kitchen | Top Pensacola stories,"This week is all about high school football and development in Santa Rosa County.

According to The Verge Farley spoke at a Ford plant in Michigan to announce a deal with DTE Energy that both companies billed as the “largest renewable energy purchase from a utility in US history”.

But after touting the company’s move to more sustainable sources he made a quick jab at his main rival in the EV space whom he has praised for helping spur the industry toward electric vehicles.

“We are really on a mission at Ford to lead an electric and digital revolution for many not few. And I have to say the shining light for us at Ford is this beautiful Lightning made right down the road in Dearborn right here in the state of Michigan already the leader of all EV pickup trucks in our industry in the US” he was quoted as saying.

“Take that Elon Musk” he added. First announced in 2019 the Tesla Cybertruck was initially supposed to go into production in 2021 but Musk has said that it will now kick off in mid-2023.

Meanwhile the F-150 Lightning is currently the bestselling electric truck in the market outselling the only other two entrants the Rivian R1T and GMC Hummer EV.

Farley’s comment was likely intended as a light-hearted dig at Musk who has also used the Ford F-150 as a benchmark by which to measure the Cybertruck’s power and performance.

He dreamed of someday becoming a marine biologist. But Levi’s world is changing.

Warming temperatures led to widespread Sargassum seaweed and harmful algae blooms in the Atlantic Ocean and 156-mile Indian River Lagoon which together encircle the island. The seaweed and algae blooms have left beaches stinking with rotting seaweed and dead marine life. In the Indian River Lagoon the algae blooms have caused an extensive loss of seagrass most notably leading to an unprecedented die-off of manatees which were left starving without any seagrass to eat. Some days Levi wore a mask at the beach to guard against the smell.

Warming temperatures also have contributed to more frequent and damaging storms and in 2017 a series of storms including Hurricane Irma which wrought billions of dollars in damage across the state caused flood waters to rise 18 inches in Levi’s front yard. His family had to fortify the home with sandbags to prevent further damage. After Levi’s mother became pregnant with his now 2-year-old half-sister Juniper a curious toddler with sparse blonde hair and big brown eyes the family decided it was time to abandon the island life and move to the mainland.

“It’s kind of disappointing not being able to live on the barrier island anymore because there’s so much fun stuff that I could do. Most of my friends they live on the barrier island” said Levi now in Melbourne. “It’s a mix of disappointment and also frustration frustration with leaders.”

When Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried announced a plan earlier this year aimed at putting the state on a path toward cleaner energy behind the plan were some 200 young Floridians all under the age of 25. Levi was the youngest. The young Floridians had found something in the state statutes with help from Our Children’s Trust an advocacy group that Florida leaders including Fried apparently had overlooked: that the statutes required Fried’s department to set goals for enhancing renewable energy use in the state. In Florida the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services oversees the state’s Office of Energy.

Florida is among the most vulnerable states to climate change and yet until now has lacked any real plan to address the main cause behind warming temperatures and wean the state from fossil fuels. Fried a Democrat is running against Gov. Ron DeSantis a Republican in this year’s gubernatorial race and she has railed against the governor for his inaction on the issue. DeSantis has focused instead on resilience projects saying he is “not a global warming person.”

The young Floridians filed a petition for rulemaking in January admonishing the state leaders and especially Fried for ignoring the statutory mandate. The petition called on the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and Fried to set goals for moving Florida toward 100 percent clean energy by 2050. After Fried announced a proposed rule in April for implementing the goals Levi felt proud about holding elected leaders accountable but felt they were capable of more.

“I’m glad that they’re doing something instead of not doing anything. But still I feel like they could have done better” said Levi about the rule which is expected to be finalized Aug. 9. “Like with a parent that they know that their kid just ran this race and placed fairly decently. They placed third. But they knew that their kid has the potential to do more. I guess it’s in some ways it’s sort of like that. Because I know that there’s more that they can do. But I’m glad that they did their best and I’m glad they did something.”

Florida's new goals call for 100 percent renewable energy by 2050

Nationwide nearly half of states along with Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have goals for moving toward 100 percent clean energy by midcentury a benchmark scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The Biden administration is aiming for 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. In Florida leaders have been hostile in recent years toward such goals leaving some local governments to step in with goals of their own although in 2021 the Legislature struck back with a measure effectively banning most local goals.

Florida’s new goals call on utilities to move toward 40 percent clean energy by 2030 63 percent by 2035 82 percent by 2040 and 100 percent by 2050. The goals are the same as those proposed by the young Floridians in their petition for rulemaking. The petition’s goals are based on a study by Evolved Energy Research a consulting firm that has conducted similar studies for other states.

The young Floridians’ 121-page petition relies on state policy dating back some 15 years to when former Gov. Charlie Crist then a Republican was in office. The Crist administration produced an Energy & Climate Change Action Plan and also set emission reduction targets that although they now are very out-of-date remain in effect according to the petition because the executive order setting the goals never was repealed or rescinded. Crist now a Democratic congressman representing the Tampa area also is running against Fried and DeSantis in the gubernatorial race. Crist and Fried will face off this month in the Florida primary for the Democratic nomination and one likely will go up against DeSantis in November.

“We read the law literally. You just read the law” said Andrea Rodgers senior litigation attorney at Our Children’s Trust which filed the petition on behalf of the young Floridians including Levi. “When we saw that that was a mandatory duty that had not been fulfilled that’s when we came up with a strategy to file the petition for rulemaking.”

The Crist administration’s clean energy goals effectively were abandoned in 2011 when his successor former Gov. Rick Scott a Republican and now U.S. senator took office. Scott transformed Florida policy on the environment and climate most notably banning the words “climate change” from state agencies making him a punchline of late-night comedians.

Since DeSantis took office in 2019 he has strived to make the environment a priority of his administration. The governor a potential front-runner for the GOP nomination in the 2024 presidential race has put millions of dollars toward the Everglades and other treasured and troubled waterways but has faced criticism for not doing more about Florida’s biggest environmental threat: climate change. The young Floridians contend in their petition the state is not on track to meet even the Crist administration’s very out-of-date renewable energy goals and that emissions have been on a statistically significant positive upward trajectory since 2009. The petition especially singles out Fried and her department.

“As of 2020 renewable energy accounted for merely 4.3 percent of Florida’s overall electricity generation” the petition states. “This lack of renewable energy development is due to the Commissioner’s and the Department’s sanctioning of the public utilities’ historic failure to develop and increase the use of renewable energy resources at the pace required by law and by the best available science.”

“I have a light inside me”

Now on the mainland Levi lives in a tidy ranch-style home with his mother step-father half-sister Juniper and dog Basil a staffordshire terrier and treeing walker coonhound mix with one brown eye and one blue eye. His mom Leigh-Ann Draheim raises Juniper homeschools Levi and works at the family’s church the Unitarian Universalist Church of Brevard in West Melbourne. Step-dad James Kilby is a professional photographer and tends the family’s elaborate home garden aimed at protecting fragile local waters from harmful lawn fertilizers and also sustaining the family. At the moment he is raising fruits vegetables and herbs with plans for more.

Levi is an affable teen with a bright smile and hair that usually he wears in a “giant Afro” which he describes as a “big part of who I am” although when we meet his hair is closely shorn. He is an accomplished unicycler and spends his spare time sailing in the Indian River Lagoon and also volunteering at the Brevard Zoo. He now dreams of becoming a search-and-rescue dog handler because he loves animals and loves helping people.

“My mom says that I don’t know how she usually describes it that I have a light inside me” he said with his mom beside him at the kitchen table. Works of art adorn the walls throughout the home colorful eclectic paintings collected from local artists. Many like one of a fish skeleton and blue-and-green Earth share a common theme of the environment and climate.

“I don’t know what that means exactly” Levi continued about the light inside him “but my mom says I have a light inside of me that helps me be a better person.”

Leigh-Ann stepped in to help clarify.

“He’s always had this really good energy about him that people are drawn to” she said. “Even when he was very little people would talk to him at the grocery store or at the library or whatever. He just had this sort of energy about him. So I think when he fell into this role I think it was a good thing for him because people are for whatever reason interested in Levi.”

Levi got involved with Our Children’s Trust through his church and in 2015 was among 21 young plaintiffs from across the country to file a lawsuit against the Obama administration challenging the federal government’s fossil fuel energy system. At about 8 years old Levi was the youngest. The plaintiffs contended the system violated their constitutional rights to freedom life liberty and property. The Trump administration later was substituted for the Obama administration. In 2020 an appeals court judge threw out the case.

Levi attended all the court hearings in Eugene Ore. and also traveled to Washington D.C. to talk with congressional leaders about the lawsuit and cause behind it. His mom always chaperoned. Over time the other plaintiffs became like siblings for Levi but the hardest part was sitting still through the hearings and meetings his mom recalled.

“He would sit there frustrated going ‘Don’t you see what’s happening? There’s hurricanes. We’ve had to evacuate my house’” she said. “He didn’t understand all the legal stuff. He just understood that his environment was being affected and that’s what he cared about.”

In 2018 Levi joined another lawsuit with other young Floridians against the Scott administration challenging the state’s energy system. The DeSantis administration later was substituted for the Scott administration. In 2021 an appeals court judge dismissed that case too but the young Floridians were not ready to give up. The attorneys went back to the statutes and discovered the mandate involving the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and renewable energy goals said Rodgers the senior litigation attorney at Our Children’s Trust.

For Florida climate change means hotter temperatures rising seas and more frequent and damaging storms. By 2045 the DeSantis administration predicts some $26 billion in residential property statewide will face chronic flooding. The young Floridians have faced these impacts in diverse ways. One young woman lives in the Florida Keys. A teen-age girl is a Seminole Indian whose heritage includes the Everglades. A teen-age boy lives on a Gainesville farm.

Levi has found his involvement in the litigation rewarding but also frustrating in a Republican-led state where leaders have taken next to no action on climate change for about a decade. He lives in a county that favored former President Donald Trump in 2020. Most of his friends have been supportive but a few do not get it. Some do not understand the problem he said. One friend asked why not speak up about “bigger” issues like racism and homophobia. Levi said he feels a unique responsibility about climate change as a person of color. He points out low-income communities and communities of color often are more vulnerable to impacts.

“African-American people sometimes most of the time we don’t live in as safe or as strong a neighborhood” said Levi. “Or if we do then it’s in the area that is more greatly affected than some other people that may have better opportunities.”

Natural gas remains Florida's primary energy source

Among Florida’s leading energy providers—Florida Power & Light Co. Duke Energy Florida and Tampa Electric Co.—all have made strides in recent years toward cleaner energy especially solar. FP&L parent company NextEra Energy Inc. announced a plan recently for eliminating carbon emissions completely from its operations by 2045 which some clean energy advocates have cheered as game-changing. Nonetheless natural gas remains the state’s primary energy source at 73 percent in 2020 double the national average the young Floridians say in their petition.

“At these rates of increase renewable energy production will not equal natural gas energy production until the year 2140” the petition states. “Taking five generations just to achieve parity between natural gas and renewable energy use represents an abject failure to capitalize on Florida’s ‘significant solar potential.’”

It is not clear how compliant Florida utilities will be with the state’s new renewable energy goals as the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services lacks the authority to enforce them. Instead the department will require utilities to submit their 10-year reports which the department will review for compliance and forward to the governor Legislature and Public Service Commission which oversees the state’s utilities.

“The question will be: Is the Public Service Commission willing to hold the utilities accountable?” said Rodgers of Our Children’s Trust. “That’s yet to be seen but that’s really how this should work.”

Others are less optimistic. Jonathan Webber legislative and political director at Florida Conservation Voters an advocacy group said the utilities need more accountability.

“There are a lot of ways that we can transition from where we are now to the clean renewable energy future we need” he said. “But unfortunately the way it’s going is that’s going to be completely on the utilities’ terms to maximize profits as opposed to helping Floridians.”

As for Levi he has spent half his life at this point involved in climate litigation aimed at holding federal and state leaders accountable on fossil fuels. He said he would not have it any other way.

“If you were given an opportunity to stop an explosion that would kill everyone and you’re given that opportunity to stop it. If you don’t take that opportunity and you survive that’s something that will always be there that you’ll always know that you didn’t do something that you could’ve done” he said. “So I think that if you think about it that way that if I didn’t if I don’t take action then that will be something that will hang with me that I’ll know that I didn’t do something that I could have done.”

RALEIGH N.C. (WTVD) -- Raleigh is preparing to launch its first-ever social district Sip n' Stroll Downtown on Monday.

The social district is a designated area in downtown where people can drink beer wine  or cocktails as they walk the streets. Alcohol purchased inside the new area can be carried outside a bar or restaurant.

Nina Borji who was downtown on Sunday night said this move could be good for the city.

""Drinks are expensive and it sucks to have to throw it out when you leave a bar"" Borji said.

She just moved to Raleigh from St. Louis where she described a similar experience.

"" I remember when it first happened we thought it was gonna be really bad because we just assume that people would be out drinking as a bad thing but it wasn't"" Borji explained.

So far 66 business owners have opted-in to the pilot program. City leaders are also answering questions people have that range from concerns over litter to public intoxication in the new social district.

""That has been a frequent question we've gotten"" said Whitney Schoenfeld who serves as Raleigh's interim senior manager for the office of Emergency Management. ""Through our research with talking with other cities that really hasn't been an issue. Same thing with trash and litter.

A family have paid a loving tribute to their son and brother who was the ""life and soul of the party"" after a coroner ruled he took his own life. Rhys Baldwin's relatives also urged other men who are struggling with mental health issues to seek help and called for increased awareness of signs of ill mental health.

Mr Baldwin from Long Eaton had struggled with mental health issues after sustaining severe facial and head injuries when he was a passenger in a car that was involved in a serious road traffic collision in February 2010 when he was 18. His family said at an inquest held on Tuesday August 9 2022 that they ""lost him 12 years ago"" and that he had post-traumatic stress disorder after the crash which they described as ""horrific"".

The 30-year-old's family said in the hearing that despite the severity of the crash the 30-year-old was ""a funny lad"" ""happy-go-lucky"" and ""loved all his family"". They added that he was someone who ""lit up the room"". In a moving statement following proceedings they also said he had an ""infectious"" laugh and a ""heart of gold"" with hundreds attending his funeral after his death on January 4 2022.

They said: ""The road traffic accident Rhys had in 2010 left him with severe facial and head injuries which had a massive impact on his mental health. Despite the accident and all the hurdles over the last 12 years Rhys was a loving son brother and uncle.

""He had a heart of gold and was loved and adored by everyone. He was so caring and would do anything for anyone. He loved helping people especially his many friends.

""To his friends he was a 'brother' and a 'legend'. He was funny he was always the life and soul of the party and the kind of person who lit up the room when he arrived.

""His smile and infectious laugh would light up the darkest of rooms. People only had to meet him once to fall in love with him.

""He had over 300 people at his funeral which showed just how loved he was. At his funeral we asked for donations which were donated to the Long Eaton Oasis Christian Centre 'time to talk' which is a community service where people can go to talk about mental health issues.

""His death has been a massive loss to our family and his friends as he was a big personality. This has been the hardest thing we have had to deal with as a family and we all love and miss him dearly.

""We definitely feel there needs to be an increased awareness of mental illness particularly in young men and better access to help.""

At the inquest held at Derby Coroners Court Sophie Lomas assistant coroner for Derby and Derbyshire recorded a verdict of suicide. Mental health issues were listed as a contributory factor to Mr Baldwin's death by a pathologist following a post-mortem examination completed on January 7 2022.

Reading statements from family members and police officers Ms Lomas said that Mr Baldwin was born in Nottingham and his family lived in Sutton-in-Ashfield near Mansfield. He was discovered dead in the morning of January 4 2022 when his father visited his home in Station Road Long Eaton after concerns were raised for his welfare by his former partner.

Police officers later found a note left by Mr Baldwin. They found no evidence of foul play or third-party involvement during their enquiries.

Health records showed that Mr Baldwin had visited his GP on several occasions following the crash reporting symptoms of mental health issues including low mood low appetite and flashes of suicidal thoughts. However he told doctors at the time that he did not wish to act on these.

Recording her verdict Ms Lomas said: ""These cases are difficult as there are lots of questions especially 'why?' and I have to limit that to 'by what means' rather than the broader why. I know that is not always satisfactory.

""Rhys Baldwin died at his home address in Long Eaton on January 4 2022. Rhys had suffered with mental health problems for a considerable number of years following injuries sustained in a road traffic collision in 2010. This court is satisfied on balance that Rhys had the intention of ending his life.

""Let me conclude by offering my condolences on behalf of the staff here. It is so difficult this situation as there are always so many unanswered questions. My process can never answer all of those.""

EBAY,eBay,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY2hhbm5lbHgud29ybGQvMjAyMi8wOC9lYmF5LWF1dGhlbnRpY2l0eS1ndWFyYW50ZWUtZnJvbS1hLXNlbGxlci1wZXJzcGVjdGl2ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,eBay Authenticity Guarantee from a seller perspective,"David Brackin managing director of Stuff U Sell the leading eBay trading assistant in the UK and a regular Tamebay contributor. Today he takes a look at the eBay Authenticity Guarantee and questions whether it’s fully supporting sellers or if there are too many false positives built in which can negatively impact the shopping experience for high value buyers:

If you sell everything competitors will come and cherry-pick valuable categories leaving you the harder sales: Watchfinder and Vestiaire Collective have been dining handsomely on eBay’s lunch for years. High ticket items in these categories mean buyers need to give a lot of trust and eBay also gives ground to new-comers here. In the early 2000s eBay suffered from many fakes and scams and as a result invented most of the answers to reputation and trust in ecommerce. Not all of these were good – for example the terrible VeRO scheme that was born of the 2004 Tiffany lawsuit – but overall buyers can be confident that they can buy genuine goods and always return them if they are not happy. However somewhat unfairly eBay’s reputation is yet to catch up and in any case on high ticket items errors – even if resolved – are bad experiences.

With GMV lagging and the alternative being the death spiral of charging sellers ever more eBay has decided to fight back. During last week’s Q2 results CEO Jamie Iannone doubled down on the “focus categories” and in particular “investments in trust” in those categories. The main investment in trust is the eBay Authenticity Guarantee programme which has rolled out in the UK for sneakers (over £100) watches (over £2000) and handbags (over £500). A pilot for fine jewellery has started in the US.

The Authenticity Guarantee works by putting eBay in the middle of the transaction – the seller sends the item to the authentication centre which inspects the item and then sends it on to the buyer with a little note to reassure them that it has been fully checked – or rejects it and sends the item back to the seller refunding the buyer. The buyer gets their item a little later but with a full guarantee.

So that’s the theory but how does it work in practice? My business sells a lot of branded goods in particular sneakers so we have been involuntary guinea-pigs.

Getting directly involved in the logistics is high risk for eBay – but this isn’t it’s first time: the Global Shipping Programme remains one of the better eBay products – but that was always optional grew slowly and developed over many years and built out customer guarantees to ensure that it was never worse for buyers and sellers. Unfortunately the Authenticity programme has been rushed out is poorly integrated into the existing product flow and has little by way of support for sellers.

The first returns we saw were a complete surprise given that we weren’t selling fakes. The return notification email has no detail and you have to dig into the returns section of the website to find the few words that might help you understand what is wrong. It seemed the authenticator had an issue with our description and in particular the condition statement. I pay good attention to eBay’s announcements but this is when I first learnt that the authenticators of the Authenticity Programme are concerned with more than just authenticity – they claim to be expert in all the subjective areas of the description. Authenticity does more than it says on the tin. I hope that this nuance wasn’t lost of our buyers who may have left with the impression that if our item failed Authentication then we must sell fakes. With a dozen detailed photos and plenty of words detailing everything on the shoes this highlighted a problem with eBay: the condition categories just aren’t fit for purpose. Any buyer will have been fully aware of exactly what they were buying but the tickboxes were “wrong”. A short discussion on how to fix this was had and we resold the shoes. Only to have them returned a second time. Apparently the next authenticator disagreed with the judgement of the first so we had to make another change. Two disappointed buyers and a lot of effort later they were sold to a third buyer. We’ll never know if the first two buyers would have been happy with the shoes in the condition described and photographed as they never got the chance to see them.

Then came the accusations of inauthentic goods. Several pairs of shoes sent back that had impeccable provenance. Chanel. McQueen. All mistakenly rejected. Customer Services were not well briefed on how to handle these errors. The authenticators are assumed to be infallible. “I’m not 100% sure what to do – there is no way to appeal the decision” one agent told me. With no way to appeal there must be no way for eBay to know what is going wrong. Were my buyers being told I sell fakes? Apparently eBay tries to call each buyer twice but it was clear that my buyers had not been spoken with. My reputation with these high spenders was tarnished. And then came the account sanctions – ended listings suspensions and all items hidden in search to start the weekend.

What about returns – does this programme at least protect the seller there? Well the integration into the returns flow has been shoe-horned in. Communications are not customised so templated emails are now nonsensical. Funds are mysteriously placed on hold. Despite the checks if the buyer says it is not as described then you still pay for the return postage label and the item is sent to the authenticator who then checks it and refunds the buyer before posting it back to the seller. This reverses the normal inventory flow where the stock return triggers the refund and then the relist.

I must say that in each case customer services once you speak with the right person were excellent at working through and escalating the problem and trying to get fixes. But each one probably takes an hour of my time as well as several emails and multiple calls – and what happens if you don’t have access to the right person? Account sanctions are so serious that they take precedence over all other activities – sourcing new stock merchandising and delighting customers must all take a back seat. These errors – even if resolved – are bad experiences.

The Authenticity programme is an honest effort to solve a genuine problem but it is so poorly executed at a product and operational level that is does more harm than good. The individuals doing the work are likely experts at sneakers but not at eBay and the tech and communications that surround them is badly flawed – it looks like no one has even bothered to read them. eBay needs to limit its ambition in the early days of this programme listen more closely to feedback and have the humility to recognise where it is failing. It needs to focus on better execution rather than rolling out this out across further categories at full speed.

If this is as important as the CEO suggested it is then it needs to be properly resourced and executed. eBay needs to hold itself to as high as standard as it does its sellers. Juvenal famously once asked who it was who should guard the guardians. eBay needs to figure out who will authenticate the authenticators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9zb21lb25lLWlzLXNlbGxpbmctY29uY2llcmdla2V5LWNoYWxsZW5nZXMtb24tZWJheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Someone Is Selling ConciergeKey Challenges On eBay,"ConciergeKey is the ‘secret’ status level that American Airlines gives to its top customers and top corporate travel influencers. It became legendary when George Clooney was portrayed as a Concierge Key member on a quest to earn 10 million miles in Up In The Air. The benefits of this status include top priority for upgrades; airport escorts and even occasional vehicle transfers on the tarmac during tight connections; access to Flagship business class lounges; and a next flight guarantee to ensure they get to their destination.

Customers receive this status either because they spend a lot of money with the airline – historically about $60000 on tickets (but not at a low cost per flight) or as a big corporate customer. Corporate contracts may come with a certain number of ConciergeKey memberships. Earning several million AAdvantage miles can now lead to ConciergeKey status too.

American has run ‘challenges’ for Concierge Key membership. A targeted fast track has included four spend levels for American Airlines flights that had to be met during a 90 day period. Different members received different amounts $10000; $12000; $14000 EQDs; $16000. (Those are annual run rates between $40000 and $64000.)

Shockingly someone is selling ConciergeKey status on eBay! They’re asking $2000 and say that there are 10 available.

This is actually for a ConciergeKey challenge offering 3 months of status and keeping the status through the end of the current member year (March 31 2023) for $15000 spend with the airline in those 3 months.

If I wasn’t already a ConciergeKey member I don’t think I would spend $2000 for 3 months of ConciergeKey status as special as it is. I certainly wouldn’t buy this on eBay. American Airlines Corporate Security regularly visits eBay craigslist et al and is liable to ‘purchase’ this in order to identify the seller. And if they do that they might (1) take away the status they’d granted and (2) possibly even lock the account of the person who bought that status. So it seems like a bad idea.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24vdGhlLWZhc2hpb24tY3JlYXRpdmUtd2hvLXNvdXJjZXMtaGVyLWplYW5zLW9uLWViYXktMjAyMjA4MDgtcDViODdlLmh0bWzSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC5zbWguY29tLmF1L2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uL3RoZS1mYXNoaW9uLWNyZWF0aXZlLXdoby1zb3VyY2VzLWhlci1qZWFucy1vbi1lYmF5LTIwMjIwODA4LXA1Yjg3ZS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The fashion creative who sources her jeans on eBay,"This story is part of the August 14 edition of Sunday Life.

Charles Schulz’s daughter Jill is a gold medalist

Jill Schulz’s parents grew up ice skating in Minnesota but she put on her first pair of skates when she was 10 years old according to the Los Angeles Times. Schulz began skating competitively two years later. She won a gold medal when she was 20 years old and went professional the following year.

Schulz toured the United States with Ice Follies/Holiday on Ice followed by a yearlong tour of South America with Ice Follies International. She has also appeared in Knott’s Berry Farm’s ice shows.

‘Boy Meets World’ stars Danielle Fishel and Rider Strong did an inline skating video

As mentioned in the “Killer Bees” episode of Pod Meets World Fishel and Strong did an inline skating video together early in their career called Grinders In-Line! “We’re experts in inline skating” Fishel joked in the episode.

A few years before the podcast came out Danielle Fishel’s husband found the VHS and shared it on social media. “In the past 24 hours I innocently found out my [girlfriend] is in an inline skating video” Jensen Karp tweeted in August 2017. “And I’ve already found a photo & bought the VHS tape on eBay.”

‘Boy Meets World’ star Rider Strong attended Jill Schulz’s inline skating summer camp

In that same podcast episode Strong mentioned Camp Rollerblade which Schulz created and directed back in the ’90s. “There was a big push for inline skating as a movement” Strong said. “In Santa Rosa there is a Snoopy ice skating rink and it’s [owned by] the daughter of Charles Schulz. We would go and do ramps and have professional rollerblading teachers come.”

In development with Alkimia Interactive the team’s focus and ambition is to build high-quality remake of the RPG which is set to be released for PC and next-gen consoles.

In December 2019 THQ Nordic released a playable Gothic remake prototype asking for public opinion on a possible modern remake of the classic RPG. The playable teaser appeared in the Steam Library of everyone who owned a game from Piranha Bytes.

Gothic is a fantasy-themed action RPG originally developed by Piranha Bytes. Set in a medieval world where humans and Orcs are battling it out things aren't going so well for the humans. More powerful weapons are needed to win the war so the king uses convict workers in his mining colony to extract magical ore from mines to make said powerful weapons.

But things are going so well. The magical dome erected to keep convicts from escaping the mining colony has gone haywire and covered the entire valley. This barrier has also trapped the magicians in charge of the dome inside and has provided the convicts with the opportunity to take control over the colony.

The result was the formation of three different convict factions and the magicians split into two groups.

You an unnamed prisoner will join one of the three mining factions and due to certain circumstances in the game eventually become tasked with defeating a demon called the Sleeper who was summoned by the Orcs. You will also work toward your ultimate goal of setting the prisoners of the colony free.

A release window for Gothic Remake was not provided.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXRobGV0aWMuY29tLzM0NzkyODYvMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9qb2huLW1hZGRlbi1uZmwtdmlkZW8tZ2FtZS1jb3Zlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why John Madden's return to Madden NFL cover was 'perfect way' to honor him,"John Madden never lost his passion for the game. EA Sports Madden NFL lead gameplay producer Clint Oldenburg learned that firsthand on a visit to Madden’s Goal Line Productions studio in Pleasanton Calif. in the spring of 2012. Oldenburg who was just an intern then and a few other producers walked past Steve Young and Jerry Rice shooting a commercial on their way to a back room where Madden was sitting at a large table with several screens hung up on the wall.

The group was there for its annual trip to watch football with Madden and discuss the upcoming video game they were developing. Oldenburg eventually conquered his nerves when it was his turn to talk about pass protection but Madden interrupted him. Suddenly the former NFL journeyman offensive lineman was getting grilled by a Hall of Fame and Super Bowl-winning coach.

“Just having played in the NFL on my resume that wasn’t enough for Coach. He wanted to really know if you knew what you were talking about” Oldenburg said in June. “And fortunately I passed his quiz. After that you could see he had relaxed a little bit. He put a little smile on his face like ‘All right this guy understands the game.'”

Madden retired from coaching in 1978 and stepped away from the broadcast booth in 2009 but he was always dialed into what was going on in the sport. And starting with the first Madden NFL release in 1988 he made it a point of emphasis to ensure those creating the game were too. His meetings with EA Sports would discuss everything from trends in the league and strategies to rules and safety measures.

“If he was going to put his name on anything especially a video computer game it had to be authentic” Madden’s long-time agent Sandy Montag said last month. “It had to be real.”

Madden continued his mission to maintain that realism in the annual meetings with EA Sports through last year. Just three days after Fox’s “All Madden” documentary that helped encapsulate how seriously Madden took the video game — in addition to his coaching and broadcasting careers of course — aired last Christmas Madden died in Pleasanton at 85 years old.

“I think initially it was disbelief. Everyone was feeling pretty good after that documentary had come out because they talked a lot about the video game not only Coach’s career but it was so sudden after that” Oldenburg said. “And then very quickly thereafter it was a team-wide sentiment of ‘What are we going to do to honor Coach? We gotta do something.'”

One choice stood out: Putting Madden on the cover of Madden 23. Madden had already been on the cover for several versions of the game in the past but it’s the first time he’ll do so since 1999. It’s a fitting callback given the image is the same one that was used for the first release of the game in ’88.

And when fans start playing Madden when it releases Aug. 15 the first thing they’ll experience is the Madden Legacy Game. It’ll be a matchup between NFC and AFC rosters consisting of players who meet the bar of those who made his famed “All Madden” teams. Madden will be the coach for both teams with his younger self on one sideline and an older version on another.

Beyond the game EA Sports dedicated a field to Madden at its headquarters in Redwood City Calif. The company also made a $5 million contribution to the John Madden Legacy Commitment. Over the next five years half of the money will go to four educational non-profit organizations and the other half will be used to create the EA Madden Scholarship in partnership with the United Negro College Fund to support students at 12 HBCUs.

Madden’s family and Montag were involved throughout the ideation process for all of the tributes. Although Madden wasn’t concerned about his legacy they want to help ensure that it lives on. Madden NFL being a part of that effort was always in the plans.

“Since John retired from broadcasting — you know that people unfortunately don’t live forever — so we talked about ‘How long should the video game go?'” Montag said. “You talk about legacies and John never really wanted to talk about legacy. He always said that that’s for other people to decide where he fits in. The younger generation of football fans a lot of them learn football through Madden. John was a teacher. He loved to teach even as a coach. And he did teach classes on how to watch football when he retired from coaching and he taught on television. And I think his legacy of continuing to have the younger generation learn football through the game of Madden was important to him.”

“I think it’s the perfect way to honor him.”

Initially there was doubt whether Madden NFL would ever come to be. Two years after Trip Hawkins founded Electronic Arts in 1982 he joined Madden and Montag on a train ride while Madden was traveling to broadcast a game. Hawkins was exploring developing sports computer games and wanted to license Madden’s name for a football game. Madden ultimately agreed but there was a catch: Hawkins had to find out how to make it 11-on-11 simulation football before it was released.

“They couldn’t put 22 players on the computer screen because there was not enough computer memory and both John and I felt in the mid-to-late ’80s that this really was never going to happen'” Montag said. “We really just fell into it. And obviously it worked out well for everybody.”

About four years later Madden NFL debuted. Madden wasn’t done with it there however as he remained involved in the development process in the years to come while working as a broadcaster.

“He had won a Super Bowl as coach of the Raiders he was quickly becoming the biggest commentator not just in football but in all of sports and you just don’t want to put your name on something that’s going to fail” Montag said. “If we were going to do this we didn’t want them just to use his name we wanted to be part of it in every aspect specifically the football.”

With that attention to detail plus technological advancements the game became more realistic over time. In addition to the commercial success Madden NFL began to cross over into the real-life game. Players at all levels — youth football high school college and the pros — were hooked. Not only did they play the game for fun but it helped them learn the game.

“John took a lot of pride as did EA that their tagline early on was ‘If it’s in the game it’s in the game'” Montag said. “And I think the authenticity of Madden even to this day NFL players play Madden to get ready for an upcoming game. We’ve talked to countless players where if you’re a quarterback — and a lot of them play Madden — you could see where the defense might be from your opponent and it’s realistic. Out of everything that went on with EA he took pride that the game was authentic and it was real football.”

For Madden the teaching component was the key. That was part of his job as a coach obviously but he also made an effort to do the same as a broadcaster through his conversational style and regular use of the telestrator. To him Madden NFL wasn’t any different. And just like with his other two careers he could see the effects.

“One of the things that he used to always talk about there were even little kids coming up and talking about ‘Hey well this is a Cover 2.’ You’re like ‘Holy crap.’ These kids are much smarter nowadays about football and concepts and things about that because of the game” EA Sports developer Anthony White who’s worked with the company since 2005 said earlier this month. “That whole teaching the game using the game as a tool and people learning football by the game itself coach Madden was all over that.”

Madden’s presence spanned generations as a coach broadcaster and video game ambassador. Depending on how old someone is they may know him for all three of those or just one. Regardless he had an impact that will carry on.

“I think the best thing we can do to keep moving it forward in the way that he wanted to see it move forward is to continue to use it as a tool to grow the sport” Oldenburg said. “Through his teaching the game of football and broadcasting he wanted to grow the popularity of the sport that he loved. And I think we’re an extension of that. And so I think our job is to make sure that we let our fans now in the present and into the future know both of those personas of Coach as a coach and Coach as an ambassador of this sport through his video game.”

This past development cycle was the first since Madden NFL’s inception that its namesake wasn’t a part of that process. He may be gone but the goal is to continue to construct the video game in his image.

“We won’t be able to share that with him but I’m sure he’s probably looking down and giving a wry smile if you will about it” White said. “Everything that we are doing and will continue to do will be 100 percent inspired by Coach and his influence in the game.”

Obviously Madden NFL isn’t the only way Madden will stay present. Those who knew him his fans the Raiders and the NFL community as a whole also share that responsibility.

“I think it’s important” Montag said. “We’ve had discussions with the NFL and I’ve had discussions directly with the commissioner about how do we continue to honor and remember John in the game of football and through the NFL? I mean he was so important to the NFL up until when he passed. He was involved in certain committees within the league. He had such an impact on the game and I think just continuing it falls on me and it falls on John’s family to continue to make sure that legacy is intact and is handled the way he would want it to be handled.

“It’s great to see — and important — that those continue to live on.”

Clara is described as a “stunning meditation on light shade and decay” sourced from a three-minute composition performed by a 22-piece string orchestra in Budapest. “The resultant work is wonderfully opaque and spatial equal parts lush and lurking traced in fine-grained gradients and radiant silences.

The burden of diabetes is high and it is increasing globally. According to doctors and health experts 57 percent of these individuals remain undiagnosed. Type 2 diabetes which accounts for majority of the cases can lead to multiorgan complications broadly divided into microvascular and macrovascular complications. Although it is known that proper control of blood sugar blood pressure and blood lipid levels can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes complications the management and prevention of the disease in India is a huge challenge. A similar pattern can be seen in cancer management in the country. Studies show that the cancer burden varies within the regions of India posing great challenges in its prevention and control. Financial Express.com reached out to Vineet Gupta Managing Director Eli Lilly India and sub-continent and he talked about Eli Lilly’s plan for diabetes and cancer care in India its plans and partnerships among others. Excerpts:

In India the dangers and impact of non-communicable diseases like diabetes are rising. India is considered the diabetes capital of the world. What are Eli Lilly’s plans in this segment?

Lilly has a long and distinguished history of innovation in diabetes care. The company has been a global leader in diabetes care since 1923 when we introduced commercially the world’s first insulin. In India too our diabetes portfolio includes a wide range of innovative products and we are committed to continue bringing our new innovations in the future. Lilly is expanding access to our therapies by building strategic partnerships with leading Indian companies who help us deliver on our purpose of making life better for people around the world.

You were appointed as Managing Director of Lilly India in January 2022. What are your plans and goals and how can Eli Lilly contribute to the Indian healthcare system?

Eli Lilly has been serving patients in India for more than 27 years. Over these years we have endeavored to ensure that the country benefits from the strong portfolio of life-changing medicines and advanced therapies that Lilly introduces around the world. We have been committed to our purpose of making life better and will continue to ensure that more patients in India can benefit from the discovery and delivery of our innovative medicines. To do this we continue to focus on expanding access of our existing specialty products along with developing collaborations with leading Indian pharmaceutical companies in select therapy areas to ensure that our medicines reach patients who need them. We also intend to strengthen our relationship with healthcare providers and medical community by sharing latest scientific data on new medicines/indications spanning our therapy areas. In addition we will continue to leverage different social impact programs to contribute towards improving health and supporting communities.

What are the crucial products that you are working on at the moment? How many of them will be launched this year?

For more than 145 years we have worked tirelessly to develop and deliver trusted medicines that meet real needs. Globally we are focusing on therapy areas where there is an urgent need for innovative scientific solutions such as Diabetes Oncology Pain Immunology and Neurodegeneration. Specifically in India we are expecting to launch by early next year our innovations in the areas of Diabetes Dermatology and Oncology.

In the segment of cancer diagnosis care and treatment where does India stand at the moment? What immediate steps need to be introduced to improve them according to you?

The most recent data indicates that there are one million new cancer cases diagnosed every year in India and this is expected to rise 5-fold by 2025. When diagnosed or detected at an early stage the prognosis in cancer treatment can be more positive because the cancer might be less aggressive. This also means that it is less expensive to treat. The challenge here is to ensure broad awareness on importance of early detection and expand access to treatment. Beyond this people need quick and cost-effective access to good health infrastructure. Finally they need access to new innovative medicines that improve prognosis and extend life. Driving awareness and expanding access to treatment requires collaboration amongst multiple public and private stakeholders.

Recently Eli Lilly announced that they are partnering with a Chinese firm Triastek to develop 3D-printed drugs that can more efficiently deliver medication in a person’s body. What are the benefits of such drugs? Can we expect this in India in the coming years?

We continuously explore collaboration opportunities enabling us to further deliver on our promise and improve outcomes for patients who rely on us. We regularly disclose collaboration results and studies or research outcomes as they become available.

What are the key challenges that pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly face in India? How do you address them?

Our responsibility to society starts with making quality trusted medicines that help people live longer healthier and more active lives. We are proactively making persistent efforts to seek regulatory approvals to accelerate the process of bringing our innovative products that will serve the unmet needs in Indian patients. In India healthcare expenditure puts a burden on household disposable income as majority of the expense is out-of-pocket. Increasing public expenditure on healthcare can play a significant role in reducing this burden. Lilly’s strategic partnerships within India are key to our local and global efforts to make innovative medicines available to more people.

As a global pharmaceutical company what is Eli Lilly’s current position in India and what are your plans for the country in the coming years?

Our purpose has always been to unite caring with discovery to create medicines that make life better for people around the world. India is an important country for Lilly and we remain committed to bringing innovations and collaborating with health care providers and industry stakeholders thus strengthening health systems and improving care. Through strategic partnerships we will also ensure expanded access to our medicines. We are keen on collaborating with both public and private sector stakeholders to tackle unmet needs and develop the local healthcare landscape.

Columbus Dispatch

“Ohio. Find it Here"" road signs welcome visitors at most of our state's borders.

The slogan developed by Columbus-based Cult Marketing was meant to ""show how activities and attractions in Ohio can develop deep emotional connections that will last over time"" Ohio tourism officials told the Dispatch after it was revealed in 2015.

The marketing firm now uses its work with Tourism Ohio as a case study of how it was able to market a ""state that is not known for anything iconic?""

More:Letters: GIF invented in Columbus. 'Ludicrous' to say police see Black people as 'enemy'

No offense to Cult Marketing but we'd say there are many iconic things to know Ohio for.

A state steeped in innovation

We will start with the iconic inventors who brought the world the traffic signal (Garrett Morgan) the light bulb (Thomas Edison) and the airplane (Orville and Wilbur Wright). And they are far from the only ones.

For starters Columbus-born Granville Tailer Woods — the first Black mechanical and electrical engineer following the Civil War — transformed railroad technology.

In more recent years Columbus has been the home of innovations in healthcare retail and computer science. The city is the birthplace of the GIF ( Graphics Interchange Format ) thanks to Steve Wilhite an employee at the then-formidable CompuServe Incorporated.

Innovation is steeped in Ohio's history and with the announcement in January that Intel plans to spend $20 billion to build two plants in New Albany there is renewed hope that innovation will help shift the state from the ""Rust Belt"" to the ""Silicon Heartland.""

What of future innovation?

That bright future might be compromised if state lawmakers continue to push an agenda that makes many feel unwelcomed.

Around the nation companies and their potential employees are paying attention to the laws state legislature are passing regarding race gender sexual orientation and abortion access — seen as a human right by many on both sides of the issues.

The young and the educated favor abortion rights.

According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center 74% of adults younger than 30 say abortions should be legal in all or most cases as do 62% of adults in their 30s and 40s.

Sixty-six percent of college graduates surveyed said most abortion should be legal as do 63% of those with some college education.

If the employee shortage prompted by the pandemic taught us one thing that thing is that workers have options and many want to work for places that share their values.

About 80% of American workers who took part in a 2021 CNBC/SurveyMonkey Workforce Survey said that they want to work for a company that values diversity equity and inclusion.

Sought after workers want to work for companies that value diversity so it reasons that companies want to be located in cities and states that value diversity.

Clash between corporations and politicians

Eli Lilly and Co. is among the companies that recently took Indiana to task after Eric Holcomb that state's governor signed a law banning abortion except when there is risk to the life of the mother or within the first 10 weeks in cases of rape and incest.

More:'A slap in the face': Some upset Lilly Cummins wait to criticize abortion ban until Holcomb signed it

A spokesperson for Eli Lilly one of the state's largest employers told the Indianapolis Star that the ban would hinder the company's ability to attract diverse scientific engineering and business talent to Indiana and force it to expand outside of the state.

“Lilly recognizes that abortion is a divisive and deeply personal issue with no clear consensus among the citizens of Indiana"" spokesperson Molly Mccully said in a statement. ""Despite this lack of agreement Indiana has opted to quickly adopt one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the United States.""

Ohio's new abortion law is even more restrictive than the one in Indiana banning most abortions — even those that resulted from rape and incest — after a heartbeat can be detected typically around six weeks of pregnancy.

After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade in June and Ohio's new abortion law kicked in a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim left this state and had a legal abortion in Indiana.

Diversity and inclusion are a part of business

Changing demographics of the workforce and the nation's population help make diversity and inclusion a topic of conversation at many companies even before the murder of George Floyd brought inequalities against Black people and other marginalized groups out of the shadows.

Most large companies and many smaller ones have diversity equity and inclusion policies and/or initiatives.

Intel has been measuring its DEI efforts for more than 10 years according to an article published by HRexecutives.

Intel published the United Kingdom study ""Inclusion: The Deciding Factor - How inclusion and diversity will shape business success — in 2030."" Among other things it concluded that it is ""increasingly important for people to work somewhere that welcomes people of different backgrounds provides equal opportunities for underrepresented minorities and people with disabilities and which is LGBTQ+ friendly. ""

After backlash from its employees earlier this year the Walt Disney Company entered a messy feud with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over that state's new Parental Rights in Education law which critics have dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" law.

The conservative Ohio Chamber of Commerce is among several business groups that have spoken against House Bill 616 which would suppress what teachers can teach kids about the LGBTQ community racism and history.

“Ohio needs to be a welcoming place for all. We should focus on ways to cultivate and harness the talents of Ohioans while also attracting out-of-state workers to relocate here"" an April statement from the Chamber reads. ""The Chamber is concerned that that some of the language in this bill may impede Ohio’s ability to lure the best and brightest minds to fill these openings and put down roots in the Buckeye State; however we trust that through the legislative process everyone will get a chance to have their voice heard.""

Way back in 1984 the Ohio Division of Travel and Tourism created the famous slogan ""Ohio The Heart of It All.""

We believe the Buckeye state remains the heart of this nation.

But we cannot grow if it is not welcoming.

That's bad for our businesses and terrible for our people.

Riffing off of Em's song ""The Real Slim Shady"" it's a full-on diss record toward the Detroit native featuring barbs on everything from Eminem's daughter Hailie to his talent as a rapper. The song lasts for a whopping 10 minutes and 26 seconds.

After its release there were reports that Eminem's daughter Hailie Jade had shaded The Game on Twitter. However she has spoken to make it clear that it was not her.

David Alaba scored on his first touch as Real Madrid staged a second-half comeback to walk away with a 2-1 victory at Almeria.

Manchester United academy graduate Largie Ramazani opened the scoring on six minutes latching onto an Inigo Eguaras long ball before sending a low strike past a diving Thibaut Courtois into the bottom left.

The result seemed to stall the defending champions who couldn’t find a breakthrough despite dominating in possession.

Their persistence finally paid off in the 61st minute when Vazquez Lucas levelled from the centre of the six-yard box.

Alaba then came off the bench and wasted no time firing an assured free-kick into the back of the net for the game-winner.

Valencia meanwhile clung onto a 1-0 lead from a Carlos Soler spot kick despite going down to 10 men after Eray Comert was shown red early in the second half.

Bayern Munich extended their perfect start to the new season with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Wolfsburg.

Jamal Musiala earned Bundesliga Man of the Matchday honours after he opened the scoring on Sunday on 33 minutes with Thomas Muller doubling Bayern’s advantage ten minutes later.

Elsewhere Union Berlin held Mainz to a goalless draw.

A dramatic afternoon in Rome saw both sides drop down to 10 men after Luís Maximiano was sent off just six minutes into Lazio’s home clash with Bologna with Adama Soumaoro seeing red in first-half stoppage time.

Marko Arnautovic scored from the spot to open the scoring on 38 minutes before Lorenzo De Silvestri took a deflection amidst a goalmouth scramble and sent it into his own net before Ciro Immobile fired in the winner for the hosts.

Cremonese were also left short-handed after Gonzalo Escalante was sent off in their 3-2 loss to Fiorentina while M’Bala Nzola’s first-half strike was enough to secure Spezia their Serie A win over Empoli.

For Rockwell the company used a a deserialization attack. (a Rockwell Automation Employee CC BY-SA 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons)

Usually when you think about someone hacking a programmable logic controller the PLC is the final target of the attack. Adversaries use other systems to get to what will ultimately let them create some kind of industrial havoc.

But a DefCon presentation from Claroty Team 82 poses a question: what if someone used a PLC as a vector rather than the destination?

“Evil PLC” is what the researchers believe is a novel attack scenerio: infecting whichever engineer communicates with a PLC with malicious code. As a proof of viability Claroty published a set of 11 new vendor-specific vulnerabilities that would allow for the attack. Those vulnerabilities are found in Ovarro TBOX B&R (ABB) X20 System Schneider Electric Modicon M340 and M580 GE MarkVIe Rockwell Micro Control Systems Emerson PACSystems and Xinje XDPPro platforms. All but the Emerson were issued CVEs.

Click here for more news out of Black Hat 2022.

The idea stems from Claroty wanting to know more about the adversaries targeting their honeypots.

“We asked ourselves how can we actively attack the attackers? We don't know anything about them. We cannot find them” said Claroty director of research Sharon Brizinov. “And then we kind of had a eureka moment and we thought okay what if the PLC was to be weaponized?”

Claroty accomplished an Evil PLC using a ZipSlip attack against vendors (Emerson Ovarro B&R GE and Xinje) heap overflow against Schneider and a deserialization attack against Rockwell.

There are two attack scenarios that Claroty says Evil PLC would be appropriate for. The first would be if the PLC was the only vector into a secure facility. The attacker could wait for an engineer to connect to the PLC and infect the engineer workstation. That could be expedited by using the newfound access to the PLC to encourage an early inspection.

“Once the attacker weaponized the PLC maybe they deliberately cause a fault on the PLC. The engineer would be lured to the PLC to check what's going on with it” said Brizinov.

Another scenario would be to take advantage of the number of PLCs serviced by outside engineers. One engineer connecting to one PLC could spread malicious code across several enterprises.

“Usually PLCs are the crown jewel. When we're talking about classic attack vectors in ICS domains we're always seeing the PLC as the endpoint the end goal; but if we're playing with those ideas and shifting our thoughts a bit we can we can get to new ways of how to defend and attack both networks” Brizinov said.",,,,,,,,,

Takeovers were booming after the pent-up demand of Covid-bound 2020 and super-low interest rates were sending pension funds and endowments to seek riskier but higher yielding homes for their cash.

Jackson found his backers. Bridgepoint — famed for investments over the decades in businesses from Pret A Manger to Agent Provocateur — floated at 350p a share or £2.9 billion.

So keen was demand to share in Bridgepoint’s riches that the share price leapt more than a fifth on its first day climbing further in the following weeks.

Now little over a year later Bridgepoint shares are changing hands for just 280p — marking a near 50 per cent slide from their peak.

Said one analyst following the stock: “They sold at the top which is what private equity guys are trained to do.”

In fairness to Bridgepoint it is not alone. Shares in EQT the Scandinavian private equity firm have plunged 39 per cent. Intermediate Capital Group is down 30 per cent

Private equity was truly in clover a year ago. Having raised billions of dollars to invest — firms raised $1.8 trillion in 2021 alone — they were snapping up companies as never before. A total of 8548 deals worth $2.1 trillion were announced around the world in that year.

But central banks’ belated moves to signal interest rate rises watered down the punchbowl at the private equity party towards the end of the year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and resultant inflation threw the booze down the sink.

Share prices particularly of the tech-driven companies that had been attracting the most private equity takeover cash plunged and deals juddered to a halt as company owners refused to sell at such low valuations.

The fall in stock market values has meant pension trustees limited in the percentage of their funds they can put into “alternative” investments such as private equity suddenly look too exposed to them. They could not invest more even if they wanted to.

That is a problem adding to the fact that there are many private equity players all out at the same time trying to raise new funds.

The head of one US buyout giant said: “It’s really tough. We’re out there meeting potential investors right now and there are 15 or 20 others doing the same thing.”

Bridgepoint is seeking to raise a fund of €7 billion. So far it has raised €4.7 billion but as Jackson warned: “There’s a lot of congestion out there.”

Private equity firms make much of their money from the 1.5 per cent or so they charge investors annually on the funds so the pot has to be constantly recycled. One analyst cited concerns over Bridgepoint’s ability to fundraise as a reason for its share price weakness.

Mark Veldon co-leader of the EMEA private equity practice at consultants AlixPartners said: “The challenge is that they’re all fundraising at the same time. There is an abundance of capital available but inevitably they are going to be tapping up the same people so there will be a lot of scrutiny on past performance and they will need to be very clear on their investment strategy going forward.”

Given how rapidly tech company valuations have slumped you would have expected private equity funds’ portfolios to have done the same. After all the Nasdaq index is down 19 per cent so far this year — and that is despite a recent bounceback from its lows.

Yet away from the high profile venture capital funds who invested in early stage tech if you believe the PE firms’ books the valuation slump is yet to happen. Take the portfolio of software investor Hg Capital. The value it put on its stake in the German online car dealer MeinAuto fell by a modest 9.7 per cent between December 31 and March 31. Between the same dates the world’s biggest player in that market Carvana saw its share price fall 42 per cent on the Nasdaq.

Hg’s cluster of investments in business software providers remained broadly flat during the period while the shares of IT giant Sage on the London Stock Exchange fell 16 per cent.

Hg — as shown by filings for its Hg Capital Trust vehicle — was still valuing its biggest 20 investments at nearly 27 times their underlying profits measured by earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation.

The company argues that its firms are “defensive” because their services are deeply ingrained in the businesses they serve. It added that businesses it recently disposed of had fetched higher prices than they were valued at on the books.

However a rival chief executive whose fund investments are valued far less highly said: “Let’s face it would you want to be in a fund that claims its tech portfolio is worth 27 times?”

Professor Ludovic Phalippou of the University of Oxford’s Said Business School said: “These private equity firms can value their companies in whatever way they like. The stock market can fall a lot but their valuations do not move. We saw this even in the 2008 global financial crisis. To be polite they have a lot of flexibility in how they value their companies. It is quite sneaky but not illegal.”

Pierre-Antoine de Selancy of 17 Capital is an investor in private equity funds and defends this “smoothing” effect. “The point of private equity ownership is to buy improve and then sell. Typically they will be selling them in three to five years so the value from quarter to quarter is less relevant. As long as they are executing the business plan it’s fine with me.”

Even so investments made in technology sectors last year at the height of the market seem highly unlikely to result in decent returns for investors.

One private equity boss is scathing of the stampede rivals made into the tech scene in 2020 and 2021. “You’re going to get some pretty rough vintages and investors are going to suffer” he said. “They’re just going to have to hope there are better years for the fund ahead.”

Most firms invest their funds over a period of several years partly because investments take a long time to find and transact but also to ensure acquisitions are spread over different stages of the economic cycle.

Some funds failed to do that in the 2020-21 boom rushing to invest in a frenzy of Fomo — fear of missing out. One private equity tycoon who fought the temptation said there was pressure from some investors on private equity fund managers to act in haste: “The average age of a City exec these days is about 28 — they’ve never lived through a recession. So in 2020 they’d be saying to us: ‘Why aren’t you investing more quickly?’ We’d have to walk them through the importance of discipline.”

Takeover deals have all but dried up over the past six months largely because banks are refusing to finance them in the uncertain economic climate. Private equity firms typically juice up their returns on deals by borrowing a large chunk of the purchase price. There are exceptions — when buyout group EQT and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund bought Envirotainer which supplies chilled containers to transport vaccines around the world for €2.8 billion in June EQT stumped up the financing itself. But they will be the exception to the rule.

Carsten Woehrn head of financial sponsors mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan is optimistic that the current drought in bank lending will not last. “As soon as the climate improves the capital markets will come back which will add tremendous firepower for private equity investors.”

He predicted a strong bounceback in the number of private equity firms buying UK plcs. “There are quite a lot of preparation discussions. Private equity funds are constantly screening targets and we have received a good number of inbound calls discussing potential take privates . . . we do expect that activity to increase as soon as the capital markets are open.”

Mark Veldon co-leader of the EMEA private equity practice at the consultancy AlixPartners said: “Where there is a will private equity will find a way to finance deals. They will get creative when they are feeling bullish.”

Much of the dealflow in recent years has been when private equity firms sell firms between them — a controversial practice that annoys some pension fund managers. “This is merry-go-round finance” says one. “When it’s one PE firm selling to his buddies at another I find it hard to believe it’s getting done at the best price. I only want to sell to PE firms who will sell to trade buyers or the stock market. It feels like it’s all too cosy — I’ll sell you this today if you sell me that tomorrow.”

The PE firms say each deal is priced individually and on correct market valuations.

Such secondary buyouts will be a major feature when the deal market returns — which may be sooner than you might think.

In what the PE world is seeing as a big test of confidence French private equity firm PAI Partners is expected to formally kick off a sale process for a business called M Group Services in the fourth quarter of this year.

M installs and maintains water energy and telecommunications networks in the UK — a topical business at a time of hosepipe bans and looming power shortages.

As such it has stable revenues that could prove highly sought after in the current market. Sources say it could fetch between £1.5 billion and £2 billion and potential private equity buyers have been “warmed up” for a potential auction.

PE firms still have more than $1 trillion of dry powder sitting in their funds waiting to be invested. As AlixPartners’ Veldon points out: “They are still under pressure to put their money to work.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
EFX,Equifax,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy9wZXJzb25hbC1maW5hbmNlLzIwMjIvMDgvMTQvZXF1aWZheHMtY3JlZGl0LXNjb3JlLWVycm9ycy1tZWFuLWNvbnN1bWVycy81MDU4MTEwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Equifax's credit score errors mean for consumers,"Amanda Barroso and Lauren Schwahn

NerdWallet

Equifax one of the three major credit bureaus announced that a computer coding error resulted in the miscalculation of credit scores for consumers in a three-week period between March 17 and April 6. For 300000 consumers the error shifted credit scores as much as 25 points. The changes to credit scores did not show up on credit reports Equifax said in a press release.

While the error caused scores to shift in positive and negative directions a 25-point drop in your credit score could do some major financial damage especially if you’re on the cusp of one of the credit bands. For some consumers that could mean less access to financial services and products like car loans and home mortgages as well as credit cards with good terms.

NerdWallet spoke to credit experts and consumer advocates to nail down what you should be doing in the wake of this Equifax error.

How to tell if you were affected

It might not be easy to determine if you were affected by this Equifax error. “To the naked eye a consumer would never know they were impacted to the good or to the bad” credit expert John Ulzheimer said in an email.

Equifax says it’s “collaborating with our customers to determine the actual impact to consumers” although it’s unclear how or when they will notify the impacted customers if at all.

“This is not the consumer’s fault” says Chi Chi Wu an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. “And it is outrageous that an error by Equifax harmed consumers and now they have to go back and fix it.”

Follow these steps to help safeguard your score in the wake of the Equifax error:

If you applied for a car or home loan or a credit card between March 17 and April 6 and your application was denied or you had to pay more — potentially as a result of this miscalculated score — you might have some recourse if you received one of the documents below:

Adverse action notice: If your application was denied you should have received an adverse action notice. Federal law requires creditors to tell you why your application was denied and which bureau they got their information from so it’s important to review this letter to understand better if the coding error impacted you.

If you were declined “because of things that showed up on your credit report if it has to do with your credit score in some way shape or form then it’s worth going back and pulling a copy of your credit report and your credit score” says Bruce McClary senior vice president of communications for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. It’s also worth “finding out what credit score the creditor was using to evaluate you” he says.

Risk-based pricing notice: If you applied for a loan or credit card during this period and were given less favorable terms (e.g. higher interest rates) you should have received a risk-based pricing notice.

If consumers applied for a credit card or loan during this time and did not get one of these two notices then according to Ulzheimer “they were not denied and they were not adversely approved with disadvantaged terms.”

Check your Equifax report

Checking your credit report should be your next step. Here you’re looking to see if a hard inquiry — or a request to check your credit — shows up. This “hard pull” is confirmation that you applied for credit during the three-week time frame when the error went undetected by Equifax.

Disputing the error with Equifax is not an option since the miscalculated scores did not appear on credit reports. “There wasn’t an error on their Equifax credit reports that required an investigation and correction” Ulzheimer said. “This was a programming error that wasn’t impacted by how a consumer acted or paid their bills.”

If affected contact your lender and ask it to reassess your application or loan terms.

Getting rate changes on a credit card will be easier than changing the terms of a mortgage or car loan according to Wu.

If you believe you may have been affected you can also try calling Equifax’s customer service at 1-888-378-4329.

Be on the lookout for a message from Equifax

Keep an eye out for further communications from Equifax. “The onus is on the credit bureau to notify the people who were impacted and provide some course of action that people can take to address any issues that stemmed from this mishap” McClary says.

Crime? Poverty? Vulnerability to natural disasters? These negative images reflect the stigma reinforced by popular culture that many U.S. residents assign to manufactured home parks – the official name for these dwellings under federal standards adopted in 1976.

Over 20 million Americans live in manufactured housing – more than in public housing and federally subsidized rental housing combined. Yet many people including urban planners and affordable housing researchers see manufactured housing parks as problems. In contrast we see them as part of the solution to housing crises.

We are urban planning scholars who study climate vulnerability community economic development and equity in urban land use. Our research suggests that misguided stereotypes blind scholars and policymakers to the possibility that mobile homes can help address the affordable housing crisis and climate change. Here are some misperceptions about this widespread form of housing.

Stereotype 1: Manufactured housing is shoddy

Many people think manufactured homes are poorly built even though these structures unlike site-built houses have had to meet federal safety standards since 1976. These safety standards have been periodically updated often in response to disasters. Today new well-installed factory-built homes are comparable to site-built homes when it comes to standing up to wind fire and other disaster threats.

Compared to homes built on-site manufactured housing costs half as much per square foot – partly because it’s easier more predictable and cheaper to build homes in factories. Many quality problems associated with manufactured housing arise from home installation park maintenance and infrastructure issues. No matter how well-built homes are residents can suffer if they are installed on unstable foundations or if park owners allow water sewer or power utility infrastructure to crumble.

Stereotype 2: Manufactured housing parks are always exploitative

While many manufactured housing residents own their homes they may not own the land the homes sit on. This can leave them at the mercy of predatory park owners and investors. Moving manufactured homes is difficult and expensive despite the “mobile” label so residents of manufactured home parks can’t easily relocate when park owners allow conditions to deteriorate raise rents or evict residents.

But there are alternatives. Residents at over 1000 manufactured housing parks in the U.S. have jointly bought their land creating Resident Owned Communities.

This cooperative model gives residents control over their homes and neighborhoods. Resident-owned parks preserve affordability and help residents address their own problems including vulnerability to climate-driven disasters.

Stereotype 3: Manufactured housing parks aren’t urban or dense

Manufactured home parks are often dismissed as rural and low-density and therefore irrelevant to urban housing needs. However 61% of all manufactured housing is located in a metro area and 8% is in urban centers.

The density of these communities typically eight to 15 homes per acre is often greater than nearby neighborhoods. In Houston for example many manufactured housing parks are located in suburban areas close to the central business district. If anything local zoning in many cities limits the density of manufactured housing parks.

Stereotype 4: Manufactured housing parks are uniquely disconnected

Critics often assert that manufactured housing parks are disconnected from surrounding neighborhoods. In reality this pattern applies to most U.S. residential neighborhoods built since World War II including gated communities and cul-de-sacs. Residents of these communities value the privacy safety and neighborhood cohesion their street patterns provide.

Biased local zoning regulations also frequently reinforce manufactured housing parks’ isolation by requiring them to be separated and hidden behind tall privacy fencing. Where fragmented street networks create problems for residents like reduced walkability they can be retrofitted by reconnecting streets.

The real challenges

While these stereotypes often don’t reflect reality manufactured housing communities face real challenges.

Local governments and park owners often are eager to convert parks to what they describe as “higher and better uses” which frequently means evicting residents for commercial development or more expensive housing. Private equity investors pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are buying up manufactured housing parks which they view as reliably profitable investments. When owners redevelop parks they can evict residents with little recourse.

Residents of manufactured home parks are also increasingly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Biased zoning rules have forced many of these communities to locate on less desirable land including flood-prone sites industrial areas and highway fringes. In a 2021 review we found that 22% of manufactured housing parks across nine states were located within current 100-year floodplains – zones with a 1% chance of flooding every year.

Manufactured housing is especially common in hurricane-prone regions like Florida Louisiana and Texas. While updated building standards have substantially improved safety increasingly ferocious storms still pose a real threat.

Aging manufactured home park infrastructure including sewer water and electricity systems is highly vulnerable to extreme heat wind drought flooding and wildfires. And since residents typically have lower incomes they have fewer resources to respond when extreme events strike.

Manufactured housing resilience and justice

With economic political and technical support evidence shows that manufactured housing can overcome these challenges.

To date 20 states have adopted laws that help residents purchase the manufactured home parks where they live. These policies have helped ROC USA a nonprofit social venture create a network of over 280 cooperatively owned limited-equity resident-owned communities that are home to over 18000 households.

ROC USA provides low-cost loans to resident cooperatives to buy land and make needed capital improvements such as upgrading water sewer and electric systems. Their network of regional housing experts then works with communities for at least a decade to develop and sustain their ability to manage their parks.

Over three decades no ROC USA community has ever defaulted on a loan or sold their park. A growing number have adopted climate-responsive measures such as building storm shelters and community centers upgrading drainage infrastructure and providing emergency post-storm tree clearance and other forms of mutual aid. Other resident-owned communities are investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs for their residents.

Policymakers are paying attention. The Biden administration’s 2022 housing plan includes extensive support for manufactured housing parks.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for increasing state funding to preserve manufactured housing parks as affordable housing. The U.S. Department of Energy recently adopted more ambitious efficiency standards to reduce energy costs for residents of manufactured housing.

In our view these efforts should be coupled with legislation that protects manufactured housing park tenants and expands the limited-equity ROC model. Governments could enact laws that offer tenants opportunities to purchase their rental units and provide subsidized loans and grants to resident cooperatives. Decades of experience shows that resident ownership can transform manufactured home parks from sites of stigma and vulnerability into stable and resilient communities.

Designed by MHG Architects and developed in collaboration by The Hudson Companies The Jericho Project and HELP US which recently closed on a $215 million financing package for construction the 327000-square-foot structure will yield 174 units and 7677 square feet of ground-floor retail space. The property is bound by Atlantic Avenue to the north Fountain Avenue to the east and Logan Street to the west.

The building will be separated into two wings. The east wing will contain 69 affordable homes for low-income families earning between 50 and 70 percent area median income (AMI) and 105 homes for the formerly homeless. The west wing will comprise 169 apartments for homeless families and individuals being served by the New York City Department of Homeless Services.

Amenities for the affordable housing component will include a fitness room a landscaped common courtyard with a children’s play area multiple terraces with a garden area bicycle storage rooms and laundry rooms. For the formerly homeless families the building will offer outdoor and indoor childcare space bicycle storage and a laundry room. In addition on-site providers from The Jericho Project will provide supportive services tailored to each individual resident’s needs. HELP USA a national social service provider for the homeless will operate client care coordination and services for residents in the shelter.

The rendering shows an orthodox massing with several shallow setbacks and an orderly grid of windows. The façade is composed of varying shades of earth-toned paneling.

“Logan Fountain is an innovative model for new affordable housing and transitional housing in a single sustainable building” said Sarah Pizer development director The Hudson Companies. “Residents in both components of Logan Fountain will receive on-site support services tailored to their needs.”

Financing was provided through tax-exempt bonds from the NY State Housing Finance Agency along with Citi which provided the construction period letter of credit. The package also includes a subsidy from the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development funding from former council member Rafael Espinal and tax credit equity with Hudson Housing Capital as syndicator and JPMorgan Chase as investor. Citi provided the loan for the shelter portion which is backed by a contract with the New York City Department of Homeless Services.

Construction will begin in August with an expected completion in late 2024.

We live in a capitalist society intent on grinding down the human spirit into sellable parts. As such for many people it is no longer enough to work a steady full-time job in pursuit of debt-free financial security. In this nightmare of a reality built from panic attacks and crushed dreams we must side hustle.

The peddling of hustles is in itself a hustle. Numerous TikTok and YouTube creators promise to reveal side jobs that have allegedly netted them thousands. These videos often rack up significant views as the proletariat attribute their desperate financial situation to having an incorrect grip on their own bootstraps.

To be fair the dreams spruiked in such clips are incredibly enticing. Rent in some U.S. cities is increasing by up to 40 percent while inflation in the country has hit a 40-year high. Having a reliable set-and-forget source of passive income would be a much appreciated help in a world that has made crumbling to pieces a habit.

As such I decided to put some of these side hustles to the test evaluating them by four criteria: Ease of setup time maintenance and of course profit.

There are countless TikToks extolling various different side hustles and many share similar ideas. Three oft-repeated hustles include creating an atmospheric YouTube channel selling planners on Etsy and publishing a coloring book on Amazon. Each of these side hustles can allegedly be set up at little to no cost and advocates claim they could earn you thousands in extra income every month.

If this were true I might be able to give up my career as a reporter abandon all discourse and finally log off for good. It's a powerful motivator.

The Atmospheric Soundscape YouTube Channel

The concept of the YouTube soundscape side hustle is simple. Grab free video free audio and free video editing software. Edit your assets together and upload it to YouTube. Monetise your YouTube channel. Profit.

Soundscape YouTube videos are one of the most easily accessible balms we have to mask the anxious misery constantly pervading our brains. Steady rain crackling fireplaces and the gentle buzz of a quiet cafe are all noises people often play to trick their brains into believing the world is kinder than it is. As such there is no shortage of lengthy atmospheric soundscapes on YouTube with popular videos racking up millions of views — and millions of potential ad placements.

Finding a free editing program was straightforward enough. After a brief search online I opted for HitFilm Express which seemed both easy to use and suitable for my modest needs. I then raided Pixabay and ​​Pexels for my video audio and even my YouTube channel's profile picture. These websites host considerable collections of media that anyone can use for almost any reason free of charge and without needing to give credit.

However while Pixabay has a significant selection of rain sound effects finding audio that is unobtrusive and will loop relatively seamlessly takes time. So too does finding a visually appealing video that matches your rain sounds. I eventually selected a suitably soothing downpour and paired it with a clip of a teacup in a window which I later discovered was already popular with other would-be YouTube entrepreneurs.

Using HitFilm Express to remove the video's black frames I duplicated it alongside my audio to create my six-hour rainy magnum opus. The video then took 11 hours to export and created a file that was over 60GB.

I was not done yet though because the video then took all night to upload to YouTube. Well theoretically. In practice it actually took two nights to upload as my failure to verify my email address meant I was not authorized to upload videos longer than 15 minutes. I wasn't informed of this restriction until my entire six-hour video had finished uploading so my first upload was rejected in its entirety and I was forced to start over.

The result was that it took several days to get this side hustle set up by which time I was more than ready to start raking in that sweet sweet YouTube cash. Yet it was not to be. It turns out that in order to monetize your channel you needed to be part of the YouTube Partner Program. And to be eligible for the YouTube Partner Program you needed to fulfill four criteria. Namely have 1000 subscribers 4000 hours of your public videos watched within the last 12 months two-step verification must be turned on and you can't have any Community Guideline strikes.

Three days after I'd uploaded my soothing rain sounds my video had three views. Two of them were me.

It has gained one more view in the many weeks since but I'm still a long way off from 4000 subscribers. Would I earn more viewers if I had a regular upload schedule? Probably. However in a flooded market it's unlikely my significant time investment would yield any returns for a very long time — if it ever did at all.

The Etsy Canva Planner

There's something calming about all those straight lines and boxes. Credit: Amanda Yeo

The Etsy planner side hustle is more direct in how it purports to earn income. All you have to do is design a planner in Canva list the digital file for sale on Etsy then sit back and wait for customers. It's the Field of Dreams approach to side hustles. Build it and they will come.

This side hustle got off to a better start than my YouTube endeavors. As far as browser-based graphic design tools go Canva is incredibly versatile and easy to use though it still took some trial and error due to my lack of familiarity with the program. For example I initially didn't realize there was a grid option I could use for my calendar and had been placing each square individually. But once I explored a bit and figured out some tricks I was able to easily make attractive monthly weekly and daily planners within a few short hours.

I decided to make two planners: a blue one because the color is apparently great for productivity and a coral one because it is pretty. Playing around with my design was actually quite soothing and I would have been happy to keep making more. Unfortunately the Jenga tower of my life is not stacked in such a way that I can abandon all responsibilities in favor of designing cute stationery.

The primary drawback of this Etsy Canva hustle is the cost. While Canva can be used for free a Pro account costs $14.99 per month. You can create a decent planner for free but a Pro account gives you access to additional features such as the resizing tool which is invaluable for replicating the same design in multiple formats. I took advantage of Canva's 30-day free trial to resize my work but it's something to keep in mind if you want to keep making planners.

Etsy's fees are more unavoidable. The platform charges 20 cents to post or renew a listing which is only active for four months. If that time expires or you sell your item you'll have to pay another 20 cents to relist it. On top of that Etsy charges a 6.5 percent transaction fee when the item sells as well as a processing fee of three percent plus an extra 25 cents.

So if I sell my planners for $1.50 I can expect to make a maximum of 82.75 cents per sale. Meaning that selling 100 planners will net me a grand total of $82.75.

That isn't even mentioning taxes. Upon opening my Etsy store I was surprised to discover the planner I'd priced at $1.50 was actually listed for $1.65. As I'm based in Australia the platform had automatically added Australia's 10 percent goods and services tax to my listing. This makes sense but it would have been nice to get a heads up while setting up my shop so I could adjust my customers' prices accordingly.

Etsy also doesn't allow you to offer variations on listings for digital products meaning you'll have to create an entirely new listing and pay another 20 cents if you want to sell your blue and coral planners separately. Other sellers have circumvented this restriction by categorizing their digital products as physical which enables them to include multiple variations in a single listing. However this means they have to manually email their planners to customers rather than it being automated so it isn't a set and forget scheme.

I'm not about that life so I bundled all my blue and coral A4 and A5 planners into one listing. It has been live for over two months now and so far I have not made a single sale. As such my profit for this hustle is negative 20 cents.

Despite the significant drawbacks to the Etsy side hustle I did find designing my planners fun and engaging. There's just something satisfying about selecting the optimal shade of blue for your silly little boxes like building a tiny oasis of order in a chaotic world. If Etsy listings were free I might actually design and upload more planners as a self-soothing pastime until my store filled with hundreds of anxiety-induced variations to suit every passing whim. This is probably why there's a fee.

The Digital Amazon Coloring Book

This was the only image I edited together that was even halfway acceptable. Credit: Amanda Yeo

In my most fanciful fantasies I dream of what I'd do with just a fraction of Jeff Bezos' hoarded wealth.

According to Forbes' real-time billionaires list the Amazon founder and chairman's net worth is over $148 billion at time of writing making him the third richest person in the world. Just 0.001 percent of Bezos' wealth amounts to $1.48 million. This is more than enough to purchase a very comfortable home for a large family practically anywhere in the world plus thousands left over to take care of their needs such as food clothing heating and education for a considerable amount of time. It's a literally life-changing sum that Bezos would never even miss.

Meanwhile I'm trying to finance a mortgage by selling digital coloring books on Amazon.

Coloring books became a trend several years ago as adults took to the meditative activity. This created greater demand for such books which some side hustlers aim to take advantage of.

The idea is that you provide the line art while Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing takes care of printing it into a coloring book and shipping it so you don't have hundreds of unsold books cluttering up your home. It's a nice idea. It's also considerably more difficult if you aren't an artist.

Of all the TikTok side hustles I attempted the Amazon coloring book hustle was by far the most difficult. Though I could source images from Pixabay its license doesn't allow you to just straight up sell images without altering them. I therefore downloaded free image editing software Gimp in order to filter Pixabay's photos and turn them into line art — which did not pan out at all. The resultant images were messy sketches entirely unsuited to coloring in and I could already practically see the enraged one-star reviews.

Pixabay does have vector images which are much cleaner and have bold lines but I wasn't convinced I'd be able to modify them enough to satisfy its license requirements. Instead I spent a few days trawling through a slew of other websites promising free line art such as Publicdomainvectors.org Openclipart and FreeSFG.org. Yet despite my extensive searching I couldn't find enough suitable free images to even make a booklet. I wasn't even satisfied I had clear rights to all of the pictures I did have.

In the end my attempt at the Amazon coloring book hustle didn't even make it off the ground. But in an incredibly saturated market I didn't truly expect anything to come of it. Besides even if I had made a sale my measly income would have been further reduced by Amazon taking a cut. The house of Bezos never loses.

Passive income side hustles are a lovely dream but so is receiving a windfall inheritance from a long lost relative or being swept off your feet by an asexual billionaire. You're far better off spending your weekends relaxing performing household maintenance or searching for a job that pays better. Better yet consider working with others to mitigate and dismantle the capitalist cogs crushing all our souls. Build a mutual aid network with your neighbors join a union attend protests and vote. It may feel less direct than starting a YouTube channel but it'll definitely do you more good.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY2FuZHlzZGlydC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9iYXJiaWVjb3JlLWRlc2lnbi1oYXMtdXMtYWxsLXRoaW5raW5nLXBpbmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barbiecore Design Has Us All Thinking Pink - CandysDirt.com,"Barbiecore decor is having a hot-pink moment.

If it seems like everyone is thinking pink these days it’s not your imagination. Barbie-inspired décor—aka Barbiecore—is having a moment. A major moment.

Not surprisingly the internet exploded.

As of this week TikTok has registered a staggering 21.7 million views for #barbiecore.

It’s a major coup for the now 63-year-old doll who owned her first Dreamhouse back in 1962—before women could open their own bank accounts according to Mattel Senior Vice President Kim Culmone. “Barbie has always been a trailblazer.”

She’s come long way (baby) from the cardboard furnishings in her original mid-century pad. Barbie’s current Dreamhouse has an of-the-moment indoor/outdoor focus complete with pink pool slide and rooftop deck.

It’s a seamless fit for the iconic doll’s lifestyle. “Barbie needs a little spot for relaxing since she does have over 200 careers so she is very busy” Culmone added.

This isn’t the first time designers have embraced Barbie style. In 2009 Jonathan Adler created a real-life 3500-square-foot Malibu Dreamhouse to commemorate Barbie’s 50th birthday.

“The great thing about Barbie is that she is whatever you want her to be from Barbie the surfer to Barbie the business executive” Adler told the Washington Post.

In interiors Barbiecore “is a way for grown women to express their inner girl and a nostalgia for more innocent times.”

Etsy shop owners are all-in. Searches for hot-pink homewares are up 21 percent year over year.

“It’s all about embracing those vibrant hues and trying to think back to nostalgic times when life was a little simpler and sunnier and a little more carefree” said the website’s trend expert Dayna Isom Johnson.

At online marketplace Chairish “the color pink is really coveted right now” Noel Fahden Briceño vice president of merchandising told Clever. Case in point: 1980s bubblegum-hued chests are selling within a few days of being listed.

Paint is another way to channel your inner Barbie.

According to Andrea Magno director of color marketing and development for Benjamin Moore pink has gone more mainstream breaking away from “that little girl kind of connotation.”

Interior designer Gaby Dellal chose Francesca’s Paints Madeleines for actress Sienna Miller’s country-style kitchen.

Still she cautions: “A lot of colors may be fun for a skirt or nail polish but when it’s color on the wall it should be something livable.”

Sasha Bikoff a NYC-based interior designer and Barbie aficionado recommends a tone-on-tone approach. “Barbie mixed a lot of light pinks with hot pinks. Then I would add pops of different complementary colors that are very Barbie—aqua canary yellow and lavender.”

Bikoff recommends mixing all shades of pink. (Sasha Bikoff)

How much is too much? That depends.

If you can’t commit to painting a whole wall start with a door or door frame. “That’s a super quick and easy Saturday morning project that can add so much personality in a room” Bikoff added.

“I think that when you’re decorating for Barbie you have to think really girly and really playful. You don’t take into account a man at all. Ken lived in Barbie’s world.

“After recovering his fitness Enrique had spells with Cheadle Town in the North West Counties League and Ilkeston Town in the Southern League Premier Division Central. In 2021 he played for Pembroke Hamilton Club Zebras – known colloquially as PHC Zebras – in the Bermudian Premier Division.

“Since scoring on his international debut against the Bahamas in 2020 Enrique has gone on to accumulate a total of 6 caps and 2 goals for Bermuda. To date he has been used mainly as back-up to the team’s talisman the Bristol City and former QPR striker Nahki Wells who is 10 years his senior. Prior to arriving at the Snows Stadium this summer Enrique featured for his national team in the CONCACAF Nations League against Montserrat in the Dominican Republic coming off the bench in a 2-3 defeat.

“International football runs in the Russell family. Enrique’s late father Tokia was a defender who won 8 caps and scored 1 goal for Bermuda from 2000-2004. His uncle Antwan Russell a forward also had a spell with Ilkeston Town during a career in which he represented his country on 11 occasions and scored 7 goals while Enrique’s grandfather Earl Russell is widely regarded in Bermuda as one of the country’s best ever footballers.

“Dual-registered with AFC Totton and Totton & Eling Enrique made his Wessex League debut for the Millers in the opening day 3-1 victory at Romsey Town on Saturday 06 August. He also scored for Totton & Eling against the Stags in the recent pre-season friendly between the two sides at the Snows Stadium where he will be aiming to make his mark this season.”

Stags boss Jimmy Ball said of his latest signing: “Enrique has done very well during pre-season and shown us that he has a bit about him. He’s fast quick-witted and skilful and he’s already developing some good understandings with his teammates on the pitch that I’m sure will reap rewards throughout this season.

“He still needs a bit of work on his match fitness but he’s been working hard and showing the right kind of attitude and discipline so I’m pleased to finally be able to officially welcome Enrique to the squad.”

Liz Cheney’s (R-WY) husband Philip Perry is partner at a law firm that represents Hunter Biden in the Department of Justice’s grand jury probe regarding “tax issues.”

Trump-appointed U.S. prosecutor David Weiss is investigating Hunter and associates for tax violations and lying to law enforcement about illegally purchasing a firearm CNN reported.

As partner Perry holds between a $1000001 and $5000000 million dollar stake in the firm Latham & Watkins according to Cheney’s 2020 Personal Financial Disclosure.

Perry’s fellow partner Chris Clark represents Hunter Biden in the “grand jury investigation regarding tax issues” his company biography says.

The New York Post reported that Latham & Watkins is a Democrat “powerhouse which employs attorneys who have donated more than a “half a million dollars to President Biden’s 2020 campaign.” Federal Election Commission records show Clark has given $3800 to President Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.

Moreover Perry’s firm has advised a Chinese Communist Party-linked technology company named TME and Exelon Corporation. The State Department in 2019 dubbed TME a tool of the Chinese government. According to the Wall Street Journal in 2011 Exelon Corporation agreed to provide consulting and training services to an arm of the state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). The state-owned CNNC’s president and vice president are appointed by the highest administrative position in the government of China the Premier of the People’s Republic of China. The CNNC supervises all facets of China’s nuclear programs.

Cheney’s GOP primary opponent Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman has knocked Cheney and her husband for his connections to the CCP-liked companies. Hageman believes the Perry family is “personally” and “financially benefiting from working for China” Hageman told Just the News. Cheney’s spokesman told Breitbart News that Perry has not financially gained from the “Chinese Government” during his partnership tenure.

During Cheney’s congressional career however her net worth has ballooned from an estimated $7 million when she first took office in 2017 to possibly more than $44 million in 2020 an analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics and her most recent financial disclosure forms show. The analysis which is predicated on ranges also shows Cheney reported no earned income gifts or transactions. Yet Cheney declared she held three posts which include a trustee position at the University of Wyoming a member of a holding company and what appears to be her family’s trust.

Cheney is running for reelection in the Tuesday Wyoming GOP primary. Polling shows she is losing to Hageman by 57 points among likely Republican voters.

By generation Gen Z and millennial workers are ""significantly more vacation deprived and burned out"" than workers age 50-plus according to Expedia's latest Vacation Deprivation study of 14500 working adults across 16 countries. Some would say the best time to travel is when you're young are more junior at work and have fewer responsibilities. But these workers don't always have the authority to delegate away their tasks or they may feel the need to prove themselves while on the clock. Then there's the budget aspect of being able to travel. CNBC Make It spoke with a handful of very busy corporate leaders with decades of work experience the same question: What would you tell your 25-year-old self about taking time off? Here's their best advice.

Don't wait for the perfect moment to take a vacation

""There is never a perfect moment. My co-founders and I started building [Boomerang] when we were in our 20s. We were paying off student loans and had no money to go anywhere. But we took every chance to take lower-budget trips we could afford. Now that we're a little older and the company's more successful we have the resources to travel. But we also have kids and more responsibility. So it's hard to balance having the resources in terms of time and money versus responsibility."" — Aye Moah co-founder and CEO of Boomerang

You're not that important

""I would tell my 25-year-old self: 'You are not so important that your workplace can't get along without you for a couple of days.' There absolutely was a time when I felt the need to constantly be tied to what was going on at work. And in hindsight I'm not so sure that was the expectation of my workplace as much as it was my own ego that I thought they just couldn't possibly get by while I took three days off. And that's just silly."" — Melanie Fish head of global PR for Expedia Group Brands

Be more adventurous

""When I was younger every five to seven years I'd go on trips with my parents to where they grew up in Southeast Asia. In my 20s I would much rather be going out with my friends in Vegas. It took me a while to think of how much of a privilege it was to connect not only with my family but my ancestors and where I came from. Those were some of the more transformative moments I've had as an individual learning where I came from."" — Eric Han head of U.S. safety at TikTok

Those who have a problem with your boundaries are trying to take advantage

""Set boundaries and actually take vacation. The only people who have an issue with you setting boundaries are the people who've been taking advantage of the fact that you're not setting boundaries. In all my years of working I've never been like 'Man I should have worked that extra day and skipped that day of vacation.'"" — Courtney McMillian head of total rewards at Twitter

Take time off every day

""Taking time off every day is critical. If you're waiting to go on vacation three months from now oh my gosh that's a long time. Time off does not have to be a big fancy expensive vacation. It can be turning off your devices after hours. Time off could be between lunch and your next meeting. Time off can be your dinner time with your family. Small exercises throughout the day can go a long way whether it's a two-minute meditation or time spent stretching. Take that time for yourself."" — Dr. Geeta Nayyar chief medical officer at Salesforce

Don't overwork to prove yourself

""I don't want to speak for everyone but I'm a first-generation immigrant. And often when we come to this country we have a tendency to overwork to prove ourselves because we have so many obstacles to overcome. But I'd tell my younger self to just take a break. You will be better if you do."" — Desiree Pascual chief people officer at Headspace Health

Figures published last month show that in 2021 most EU countries registered their highest tourist numbers in July and August.

Those numbers waned throughout the rest of the year whereas Malta managed to remain a year-round destination.

The island came in a close second behind Finland.

“Tourism demand in some EU member states is particularly concentrated in the summer months of July and August” Eurostat notes. “By contrast while it does have a summer bias Malta is a year-round destination with demand spread more evenly across the calendar.”

Eurostat is the official statistics office of the European Union and periodically issues publicly available statistics on the economy population wellbeing and social life of member states.

The study which looked at economy and business trends calculated tourism by the number of nights spent in tourist accommodation.

In 2021 13.8 per cent of tourism in Malta was concentrated in July and 17.1 per cent in August while 69 per cent was registered throughout the rest of the year.

This is more than what countries like Italy (51.7 per cent) and France (53.2 per cent) retained throughout the year and well above the EU average of 57 per cent.

Croatia registered the lowest retention rate throughout the year registering more than two-thirds of its tourism in July and August.

The figures also show that in 2021 more than half of accommodation was booked in Valletta.

Eurostat highlights how in three countries – Luxembourg Hungary and Malta – more than half of the nights spent in accommodation booked through Airbnb Booking.com Tripadvisor and Expedia Group were in the capital city.

By contrast Italy the Netherlands France Germany and Spain’s capital cities registered less than 10 per cent of booked accommodation nights.

Unsurprisingly the figures also show that 71.8 per cent of accommodation booked in 2020 in the EU was internal tourism within the same country as opposed to 54.8 per cent in 2019.

“In 2021 364 million guest nights were spent in the EU in holiday rentals booked through one of these four platforms well below the 512 million total in 2019 before the onset of the COVID-19 crisis” the report notes.",,,,,,

If none of these options are quite to your tastes here are a few important factors that you should keep in mind whilst looking for the best metal shed for you.

They include the material type size style dimensions weight capacity and more.

Material Type

The material that we are discussing for these types of sheds is metal. But that doesn’t mean that the discussion of what material your shed is made from ends there.

Choose wisely whether you want an aluminum or galvanized metal shed. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.

For example aluminum is lighter but requires special care while using; galvanized metal sheds make excellent storage due to their heavy-duty materials as well as their ability to resist corrosion and rusting.

Size

Metal sheds come in various sizes. Do you need a small medium or a large one? How many square feet do you need? What is the required load capacity?

What a shed is used for will partly depend on how big it is.

Smaller sheds are good for holding gardening equipment and other supplies whereas larger sheds can be excellent workstations and storage space for larger vehicles even.

All these factors and more go into determining the size of the metal shed that will suit your needs perfectly.

Style

What is your personal preference regarding the style of the metal shed? If you like minimalistic designs then you should choose one with simple lines.

However if you prefer modern styles then you should opt for a metallic and contemporary look.

Dimensions

Metal sheds come in various dimensions as well. For instance they can be round square rectangular oval cylindrical and others.

You should know that the dimension of the metal shed plays a big role in deciding how much space you will get on each side.

In addition the height of the metal shed which determines its clearance from ground level as well as how easily you will be able to stand upright in it is another dimensional factor to bear in mind.

Durability

This factor is very much tied to what type of metal your shed is built with. For example steel sheds are usually stronger than aluminum ones.

This means that they can withstand harsh weather conditions better and last longer.

Weight Capacity

As mentioned earlier this is another important aspect to consider when buying a metal shed. The weight capacity of a metal shed depends on what kind of materials it uses.

It also depends on the overall dimensions of the shed (i.e. the length width and height).

In general heavier metal sheds tend to cost more than those weighing slightly less but they’re more durable.

Assembly Time

How long it takes to assemble your shed will likely tie to how user-friendly the product is.

Some metal sheds have complicated assembly instructions that may take up to several hours or even days to complete.

Others are relatively easy to put together and are perfect for first-time shed owners.

Frequently Asked Questions

Is It Okay To Paint Metal Sheds?

Some people may like a particular shed model but not be keen on the color that it is sold as. In such cases it is okay to paint it yourself.

There are some things that you should keep in mind though. You should ensure that you are painting onto a clean surface as dirt could ruin the paint job.

Also you should avoid applying too much paint at once since it might create air pockets that could cause the paint to peel off later.

You’ll also need to pay close attention to the type of paint you use.

Thankfully most metal paints are quite robust but you’ll need to find one that’s particularly tough as it’s going to have to stand up to the ferocity of the elements year-round.

Nobody wants to have to be continuously painting their shed so choose smart before you get to work!

Should I Use A Prefabricated Metal Shed Or Build My Own?

There is no doubt that building your shed is more fun and convenient. However there are many benefits associated with prefabricated metal sheds.

First of all they are designed by professionals who understand the best ways to make them durable and strong.

They come with warranties that cover their lifespan. And most importantly they are easier to install.

What’s more as much as many of us would love to build our own metal shed most simply do not have the equipment know-how time or energy to accomplish such a feat.

This is why buying a prefabricated metal shed is such a popular option. Sure it’s cheaper to make one yourself but you invest a lot of something more valuable than money… time!

How Do I Measure The Right Size Of My Metal Shed?

The first thing you need to do is decide whether you want a small medium or large metal shed. Then you should measure the area where you plan to place your new shed.

Make sure that the measurement includes the depth of the footings as well. Once you have done this you should add 10% to 15% extra space to account for any expansion.

How Do I Insulate My Metal Shed?

Insulation is an essential feature that most metal sheds include.

It helps to retain heat inside during winter keeps thermals under control during summer and adds a bit of acoustic dampening which is perfect for those using their shed as a workshop.

You can either use foam insulation boards or fiberglass wool. Both options work great but they require different methods of installation.

Foam insulation boards are typically glued to the walls while fiberglass wool needs to be wrapped around the outside.

Conclusion

Metal sheds are one of the best solutions available today for storing outdoor items. They are practical versatile and affordable.

They are also excellent choices if you live in areas that experience extreme temperatures.

So go ahead and choose the right metal storage shed for your home!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc3B5LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9nZWFyL291dGRvb3JzL2hvbWUtZ29sZi1zaW11bGF0b3JzLTEyMDI4NzcyNTYv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9zcHkuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2dlYXIvb3V0ZG9vcnMvaG9tZS1nb2xmLXNpbXVsYXRvcnMtMTIwMjg3NzI1Ni9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Now Build Golf Simulators at Home Without Spending $20000 — Here’s How To Go the DIY Route,"If you’re golf-obsessed and have an extra room basement or garage space in your home we can almost guarantee the following thought has crossed your mind:

“How much would it cost to build a golf simulator in here?”

What To Consider Before Building Home Golf Simulators

There are a few essential things to consider before purchasing and installing a home golf simulator (besides whether or not your partner is into the idea please ask first).

How Much Are You Able to Spend?

The price of home golf simulators varies wildly and the good news is there are solid options for various price points. This also means you need to zero in on your exact budget before starting this process to know which path to take and products to choose.

You can opt for a super simple setup of just a hitting mat and impact screen and ball return net if all you want to do is swing. The setups get more elaborate—some include radar software for ball tracking camera software for tracking and computer software that takes you to courses around the world virtually giving you an on-the-green experience at home. With each step the price increases but there are plenty of low middle and high tier options for each step.

How Much Will You Use It?

This is a factor you should consider before purchasing anything but especially something big like a home golf simulator. Installing an elaborate system in your home for a hobby only to lose interest a few months later is no bueno. If you already play golf most weekends and dream of the manicured greens when you’re not on them you’re probably in the clear.

How Much Space Do You Have?

We’ll discuss measuring later but this is a crucial factor to consider before starting work on your home golf simulator. How much space do you have available? Can you swing each of your clubs in the space? Is the space too close to other things and going to cause a noise disturbance?

Before You Shop: Measure Your Space

You absolutely need to measure everything in your space before purchasing anything for your home golf simulator.

How tall are the ceilings?

How deep is the room? Deep enough for a ball from your swing to propel far enough in front of you to generate the data you want?

How much floor space do you have for a hitting mat?

Do you have space for club storage ball storage and a place to set up a computer for the ball tracking software (if you’re using it)?

Is this a space you can augment with a drill? Scuff the floors?

Minimum Space Requirements For a Home Golf Simulator

Based on personal calculations and public consensus you need a space that measures at least 12 feet long 10 feet wide and 9 feet high to build a decent functional golf simulator. This accounts for the space required for the ball path swing height and other things. Larger rooms are better and you may require more room based on your body proportions the launch monitor you use (if you use one) and your impact screen setup.

How To Build a Home Golf Simulator…

Step 1: Pick a Golf Ball Tracker

This is where the optional and expensive add-ons come into play. You can majorly improve your swing with just an at-home hitting bay and mat but if you want to get serious about factors like ball flight you’ll want some way to track your swings.

You’ll need a launch monitor if you want to track your swing at home while practicing in your hitting bay. These come in two forms:

Camera-based

Radar-based

Camera-based launch monitors are what the pros use and tend to be more expensive. Radar-based ones are cheaper but require more space to operate at home.

You’ll also want to consider the software you want to use to interpret what the launch monitor tells you. Similar to the hardware of your setup there are different tiers for software in terms of how advanced and expensive it is. Some programs are more straightforward and others take you worldwide to different courses. Often this is a recurring cost so you’ll want to factor that into your research when deciding which launch monitor to get since not all of them are compatible with all software programs.

After a lot of research here are our favorite programs.

Flight Scope Portable Golf Ball Launch Monitor

Best Overall

Flight Scope makes the most well-known portable golf ball launch monitor and it has a lot to offer players. That being said it’s definitely an investment purchase as the $2000 price tag isn’t for the average player. If you have the budget for an advanced home golf simulator then this is the top option that we recommend. Not only can it be used for your DIY golf simulator at home but it can also be used outdoors or even on the course.

Step 2: Build Your Hitting Bay

You’ll need something to stop the ball to put together a hitting bay. There are a few options for this the simplest and lowest cost being a basic hitting net from Amazon. For each option I will outline the price relative effort level and quality of the setup after you’re done.

Option 1: Hitting Net

Cost: $

$ Effort: Minimal

Minimal Quality: Low End

GoSports Golf Practice Indoor Hitting Net

This net is a low-cost way to practice hitting inside without damaging your walls or risking injury. It’s portable can be easily set up inside or outside and was designed by golfers for maximum impact absorption and durability. It has a nylon net for convenient ball returns and is easy to set up and break down.

Option 2: DIY Cage and Screen

Cost: $$

$$ Effort: High

High Quality: High

If you want more coverage and are willing to spend a little more you can build your own cage and screen to stop the ball. The best way to do this is to use metal tubes from The Home Depot to build the frame pool noodles to pad them find an impact screen for protection and zip tie everything together. You can also install side nets for added shank protection and grab duck cloth from your local fabric store cut to size to seal everything off.

Some good friends built their own hitting bay in their garage; here are a few in-progress photos for reference. I’ve linked each of the products they used below.

Step 2: The finished frame ready to attach the screen and netting. Taylor Galla | SPY

Step 3: The finished product complete with a screen and fabric on all sides for ball control and return. Taylor Galla | SPY

Conduit Electric Metal Tubing

For this tubing you’ll want to measure the total length you need to build all sides top and bottom of your hitting cage. The Home Depot can typically cut it to your exact specifications. You’ll also be covering it entirely with pool tubing so there’s no need to worry if the sides are rough around the edges.

Ball Bungee Cord (50-Pack)

Rather than using standard zip ties smaller bungee cords are ideal for attaching your ball screen to your frame because they have give and can absorb some of the impact of your golf balls. This decreases the wear and tear on the fabric and is easier to set up take down and adjust if needed. Each can stretch up to 13 inches and has a load capacity of 22 pounds.

aikeec Indoor Golf Simulator Impact Screen

This impact screen has a tight smooth surface and 14 eyelets along the border for tying off with the bungee cords. It’s 98 inches by 98 inches giving you a total of 16 square feet of hitting space and it’s fully washable so you can take it down to be cleaned from time to time.

GoSports Shank Net Attachment

Lastly shank nets can help add extra protection for your walls on the sides of your hitting bay. Some shots decide to go sideways; if that happens these can be helpful in catching rogue balls. This net can attach to the right or left side of your hitting bay depending on which side your dominant hand is on and it comes with a weighted sandbag so you can use it outdoors.

It’s engineered for high-impact with steel corner fittings and extra stitching for gap protection so the ball doesn’t get through. Note: this setup does not include a ball tracking camera or software which is most of the cost.

Step 3: Choose Your Hitting Mat

This is an area in which we don’t recommend skimping as a cheap hitting mat will wear down fast leading to uneven surfaces that make it harder to hit the ball. We recommend going with one of the following middle-tier options that are built to last can be placed anywhere will stay in place through foot pivots and accidental chips and won’t (god forbid) slip while you’re swinging.

The Original Real Feel Golf Mats Country Club Elite

This golf hitting mat is designed to mimic outdoor conditions closely with a surface that gives so it’s easier on wrists and elbows. It’s a thick mat so it can take a real tee if preferred but it also comes with a turn-and-lock practice tee and base.

Also Consider: Golf Simulator Accessories

In addition to the necessities featured above there are plenty more golf simulator accessories and golf training aids that can enhance your experience such as a projector.

A projector is also optional but can be nice if you’re using software that enables you to practice your swing at specific golf courses. Again you don’t need a complicated one to complete this job. The following pick is high-quality and at an ideal price point.

YABER Y30 Native 1080p Projector

This 1080p projector supports 4K video and 1920×1080 resolution so you capitalize on the graphics of the immersive software systems the launch monitors are built with. It has HiFi stereo sound and is compatible with wide screens. It has a remote control for adjusting the screen and five layers of high-refraction lenses for an optimal video experience.

Computer for Software

You also can purchase a computer specifically to run your launch monitor software which can be advantageous depending on your personal laptop situation. A gaming PC is ideal for this type of software and you can use a laptop or a desktop. For this purpose if you’re looking to go with one that’s as affordable as possible while still getting the job done this one will do the trick.

Most have yet to implement an official remote-only or in-person-only strategy instead easing hesitant workers back into the office with a hybrid policy. But many have been operating in a tale of two cities forcing retail workers back to the frontlines a year before requiring corporate employees to return to the office.

From Walmart to Amazon here’s a breakdown of the top 10 Fortune 500’s return-to-office policies.

1. Walmart

Walmart’s retail workers referred to as in-house associates worked through the pandemic while its corporate workers worked from home for over a year. Walmart released a company memo in October 2021 stating that corporate employees would transition to coming into the office on a “more regular basis” in November.

But Walmart’s 10000 tech employees were excluded from the decision; the company announced in May 2020 that this largely Silicon Valley-based group could work remotely indefinitely as the pandemic waned.

A spokesperson for the company tells Fortune campus-office associates have been coming into the office more regularly since February. In a February email Walmart provided to Fortune Donna Morris chief people officer said it’s the company’s intention to create a collaborative environment on campus while working toward more flexibility.

“Our ways of working will vary across teams” she wrote. “We believe it’s important that we aren’t overly prescriptive and in the nature of flexibility we all need to be open to ambiguity. We will not mandate in and out of office days or start and finish times.”

She left it open to bosses to decide what meetings can be attended in-person and on-campus but added that the company believes “it’s important to be together in our offices the majority of the time” writing that Walmart’s culture leadership relationship building and creativity all benefit when workers are together.

2. Amazon

Amazon delivery and warehouse workers continued to provide goods throughout lockdown reportedly dealing with grueling conditions while corporate employees worked from home. In October 2021 Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained in a company memo that Amazon continues to be in “a stage of experimenting learning and adjusting for a while as we emerge from this pandemic.”

In said company memo which Amazon referred Fortune to when asked for comment Jassy allows directors on individual teams to decide how many days their reports should come into the office. Jassy maintained that the company is flexible but that Amazon workers should live close enough to their office to come in within a day’s notice.

In September Jassy made it clear that Amazon isn’t looking to push an office mandate any time soon. “We don’t have a plan to require people to come back. We don’t right now. But we’re going to proceed adaptively as we learn” he said.

3. Apple

CEO Tim Cook has pushed corporate employees slowly back to the office under a hybrid model.

“For many of you I know that returning to the office represents a long-awaited milestone and a positive sign that we can engage more fully with the colleagues who play such an important role in our lives” Cook said. “For others it may also be an unsettling change.”

Employees were asked to come into the office beginning April 11th reaching a minimum of three in-person days by March 23rd. Many employees (about 76%) were dissatisfied and 56% reported that they were looking to quit.

Though Cook’s previous plans were thwarted by another round of COVID-19 infections Apple recently announced employees should save the date to come in three times a week starting September 5th.

Meanwhile Apple retail employees have been unionizing for better working conditions. It’s working: Apple agreed to make work schedules at all of its retail stores more flexible.

Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

4. CVS Health

Many pharmacists and other retail workers stayed in stores during the pandemic to take care of customers’ increasing medical needs says Erin Britt director of corporate communications at CVS Health.

Corporate employees were ushered back to the office starting March 15th. “As part of our new hybrid work format most corporate employees are spending two to three days each week at one of our office locations and working virtually on the other days” Britt tells Fortune.

5. UnitedHealth Group

UnitedHealth Group has implemented all three work models: “hybrid fully telecommute and core on-site” with an emphasis on flexible work according to an official statement the company sent Fortune.

The healthcare and insurance company pointed out that they’ve always had both remote and on-site employees but the bulk of workers right now are mostly hybrid.

“The hybrid model will apply to many of our traditionally office-based employees who will now average about three days per week in the office” reads the statement. “The hybrid model is flexible and based on manager discretion.”

6. Exxon Mobil

On-site employees seemingly remained working in person through the pandemic; in March 2020 an article on the company’s site read “For those employees whose work requires them to be at one of our facilities we have put additional safety measures in place.”

Employees based in Houston (where Exxon plans to move its headquarters to next year) were expected to return to office five days a week starting mid-May of 2021 according to Bloomberg.

“Most of our Houston-campus employees are back in the office while continuing to benefit from our workplace flexibility programs” Todd Spitler Corporate Media Relations Senior Advisor tells Fortune. He adds that while the company believes that “business is best run from our offices and workplaces” there are workforce flexibility programs that can be approved by a supervisor.

7. Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett was one of the first leaders to publicly question if people would ever return to the office after the pandemic. Charlie Munger vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway continued Buffett’s sentiment in February 2022 saying that a large portion of workers who would rather not be in the office would remain that way forever.

There’s no public official statement on the company’s policy but when Fortune called headquarters an administrative worker revealed that each branch is making its own decisions with HR on whether employees will return to office.

8. Alphabet

Alphabet’s subsidiary Google is bringing corporate workers back to headquarters on a hybrid schedule.

Google’s corporate employees were expected to return to the office three days a week starting April 2022. A representative informed Fortune that the decision was made in light of employee feedback. But there’s still room for flexibility as “employees who need more time before returning can also request a work-from-home extension.”

Feedback on the corporate roll-out of return to office varied based on the employee but the company has received backlash for its pay adjustments based on where remote workers are located.

But Google’s extended workforce—which includes vendors and temporary staff who work on short-term projects—was compensated for time spent off explains a representative to Fortune: “Throughout the pandemic members of our extended workforce who were affected by reduced office schedules and closures were compensated for the time they would have worked.”

9. McKesson

McKesson’s frontline healthcare workers continued to work during the pandemic. “During the midst of a pandemic thousands of Team McKesson members continue to work every day in order to deliver vital medical products to the frontline in the fight against COVID-19” its website reads.

An Indeed poll of about 4000 McKesson employees found that 61% said they could work remotely. As of now the company has advertised both remote and in-person positions. Reviews on Glassdoor from employees emphasize the company’s flexibility; one from March 2022 says “employs an office as a destination approach where you go to the office to collaborate but perform your duties remotely.”

McKesson did not respond to requests for comment.

10. AmerisourceBergen

The drug wholesale company is “working under a hybrid model called the ‘Work Smart Platform’ meaning that team members are encouraged to work from home and come into the office when they desire” spokeswoman Mackenzie Liberatori told The Mercury in October 2021.

AmerisourceBergen didn’t provide Fortune with details on its return-to-office policies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9hdWRpdC1vZi1leHhvbnMtdXM5Yi1jb3N0cy11bmRlcndheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Audit of Exxon’s US$9B+ costs underway,"The audit of ExxonMobil’s over US$9 billion in claimed expenses has begun and will see local auditors working alongside the Martindale Group of Oklahoma in the United States as part of their training according to Floyd Haynes head of the consortium undertaking the review.

“There is a training component that sees knowledge transfer. So what that is is the training of local accountants. We the consortium will have staff working along with Martindale. What has been suggested and agreed to is that we will send some people up to Oklahoma to work alongside the Martindale folks” Haynes told Sunday Stabroek when asked for an update.

It was in May of this year and nearly 22 months after the PPP/C took office that the Government signed a deal to audit the US$9 billion claimed by ExxonMobil and its partners as post-contract expenses.

The agreement was signed with the RHVE consortium of local accounting firms to the tune of US$700000 ($150.5 million) to audit Guyana’s 2018-2020 cost oil. The RHVE contract which has a life of four months is made up of Ramdihal and Haynes Vitality Consulting and Eclisar Financial & Professional Services (EFP) and was subcontracted to the US firms of Martindale Consultants Inc. and Squire Paton Boggs for technical support and expert assistance.

Haynes said that the commencement date of the contract took effect on June 29 2022. Since then he said the contracted consortium has been “working assiduously” in the information gathering process.

“We have had a series of meetings with ExxonMobil and we have requested documentation. The way the process works is we request documentation for the years under audit [we] review and analyze and verify and then once [we] have everything in our hand we prepare a report” he explained. “We are currently in the [documentation] requesting and reviewing phase” he added. ExxonMobil has to date complied with all requests from the consortium and has not objected to the approach of how the audit will be conducted. “They have been complying. We discussed our approach and they didn’t have any problem. We will review the data for the years under review collect information review those analyse and assess based on the agreement they have with government. If during the course of looking at the info we see something that warrants a discussion we will discuss with the Government of Guyana and then ExxonMobil. We will exhaust all efforts to ensure everyone is fully briefed” Haynes noted.

Mindful of what he had disclosed to this newspaper when the contract was signed Haynes reiterated that the audit does not set to deliberately harass any of the companies under the financial oversight process. “I continue to stress it is not a witch hunt. It is really to determine the validity of costs claimed or claimed costs. The purpose is to allow the costs of the period under review be looked at and ascertain its accuracy” he said. “People are looking for the “Got ya!” moment. But our job is to look at the costs and allow its allowability or validity as per what has been agreed on” he added. In May he had shared this view “The purpose of this audit is to verify the validity and the allowability of claimed costs. We look at what Exxon submitted and ask the questions: ‘Is it valid and is it allowable under the production sharing agreement?’ There is an expectation that we will find that Exxon has been cheating and we would like to temper the expectations of the Guyanese public.”

“The idea that Exxon has been overbilling and overcharging is grossly misleading and it is not fair to mislead the public. We don’t know what we will find but we will ensure that the costs are legitimate and allowable” he added while underscoring that the firms will do their work with professionalism and in the best interest of the country.”

Given that the report covers at least three years Haynes said that the method used for auditing will show clearly the evaluation period. “Whatever we issue will reflect our observation for each individual year. Whether it will be delineated in such a way that the information is identified for each individual year it will be clear” he said. There is no central office for the conducting of the audit as each of the companies involved work from their respective locations but are united virtually for periodic online meetings.

“A lot of the documents are being exchanged electronically so we are working from various locations and don’t have one base of operation per reworking alongside Martindale Consultants Inc. and Squire Paton Boggs” Haynes explained. But he said that local accountants will have to travel to the Oklahoma Offices of Martindale Consultants for on-the-job training. The accountants who will travel overseas have already been identified and while he is confident that they will gain a wealth of knowledge on their attachment Haynes said that he also wants to limit expectations that they will be able to conduct another on their own after their one stint. “This is not a one-time thing and this is not something that could happen in one audit. You don’t build capacity in one year” he contended.

Some of the auditors from Oklahoma will also come to Guyana at some point during the audit. When the contract was signed Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat had pointed to locals being afforded the opportunity to learn about a sector that is new here. “Our local auditors might be very familiar with auditing basic expenses – fuel meals transportation – but when we are talking about jumpers and risers and FPSOs and these technical terms obviously they will need that kind of technical knowledge and expertise on board to assist them to have a thorough exercise being done.”

Bharrat predicted that the audit will put to rest any doubts about the government’s willingness to conduct the audits. For now Haynes assured that “Everybody has been briefed and it’s on track and its going well; a lot smoother than everyone thought” he said.

The audit comes against a background of Vice-President Bharrat Jagdeo previously saying that “ExxonMobil’s post 2017 expenditures for Liza-1 and Liza-2 would not be audited as government was not able to select a strong local group to undertake it.” This disclosure by Jagdeo had set off a wave of public criticism. Stabroek News had previously reported too that the statutory two-year period for the 2017-2019 auditing had expired and there was a concern that the company might object to its books being audited after the contracted time had elapsed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNkYXlsaXZlLmNvbS9pbmRleC5waHAvMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9zZXBsYXQtZXh4b25tb2JpbC1kZWFsLWEtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb24tbWFycmVkLWJ5LWNvbnRyb3ZlcnNpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seplat/ExxonMobil Deal: A Transaction Marred by Controversies,"As Seplat Energy’s acquisition of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited ran into a hitch last week there are concerns that unless the issues are amicably and urgently resolved Nigeria may be killing indigenous initiatives and sending wrong signals to the international community seeking to invest in the nation’s oil industry reports Festus Akanbi

For obvious reasons different interpretations speculations and allegations have continued to trail the botched Seplat Energy’s acquisition of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited from Exxon Mobil Corporation.

It was a back-and-forth scenario as an earlier statement from the Presidency on Monday had conveyed President Muhammadu Buhari’s approval of the acquisition.

However the statement had barely trended in the media for a few hours before the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) invalidated the deal insisting the matter was a regulatory one and that nothing had changed after it had earlier notified ExxonMobil that the transaction had been declined.

However 48 hours later the president who is also the Minister of Petroleum Resources withdrew his consent to the controversial deal as he blamed the lack of coordination among the concerned agencies for the confusion explaining that he had weighed the likely ramifications of the earlier decision.

Oil industry experts said had the N1.283 billion sales and purchase deal sailed through the Presidency which had cited the need to attract foreign investment into the oil sector as one of the reasons for its action would have overridden the long-drawn attempt by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) to block the deal.

They added that if it succeeded the transaction would have seen the acquisition of the entire offshore shallow water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria and was expected to deliver a 186 per cent increase in production from 51000 bpd to 146000 bpd or a 170 per cent increase in 2P liquids reserves from 241 MMbbl to 650 MMbbl.

In addition it was expected to deliver a 14 per cent increase in 2P gas reserves from 1501 Bscf to 1712 Bscf plus a significant undeveloped gas potential of 2910 Bscf (JV: 7275 Bscf)

Among others it would also increase by 89 per cent the total 2P reserves from 499 MMboe to 945 MMboe including offshore fields with dedicated MPNU-operated export routes offering enhanced security and reliability.

Clarifications

A statement by the Chief Executive of the NUPRC Mr. Gbenga Komolafe which affirmed that the status quo remains concerning the ExxonMobil/Seplat Energy share acquisition clarified that the commission in line with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 is the sole regulator in dealing with such matters in the Nigerian upstream sector.

The clarification by the NUPRC Chief Executive followed an earlier statement that President Buhari had approved the acquisition which effectively nullified the long-drawn attempt by the NNPC Limited to block the $1.283 billion sale and purchase transaction between SeplatEnergies and Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU).

Analysts said the law as it stands today gives the regulator powers over such transactions. The old Petroleum Act gave powers of consent and approvals to the Minister of Petroleum. However the new law which is the PIA vests such powers in the regulatory commission. And Buhari is standing with the law.

Upholding the Law

Experts are also of the view that the NUPRC is merely upholding the law and anything short of it would have amounted to business as usual. Consequently the NUPRC has directed that the status quo should be maintained in respect of ExxonMobil/Seplat Energy’s share acquisition.

“As it were the issue at stake is purely a regulatory matter and the commission had earlier communicated the decline of ministerial assent to ExxonMobil in this regard.

“As such the commission further affirms that the status quo remains.

“The commission is committed to ensuring a predictable and conducive regulatory environment at all times in the Nigerian upstream sector” he said.

In February 2022 Seplat Energy Plc announced an agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited from Exxon Mobil Corporation Delaware for $1.28 billion. The transaction entails the acquisition of ExxonMobil Nigeria’s entire offshore shallow water business.

Industry affairs commentators described ExxonMobil Nigeria’s shallow water business as an established high-quality operation with a highly skilled local operating team and a track record of safe operations.

However it could be recalled that a pre-emptive right over the assets had been secured by the NNPC Limited which in July won a court decision temporarily blocking Exxon Mobil Corporation from selling assets in Nigeria to Seplat Energy Plc.

It was also gathered that a Federal High Court judge in Abuja had granted NNPC an “order of interim injunction” on July 6 2022 barring Exxon Mobil “from completing any divestment” in a unit that ultimately operates four licenses in Nigeria.

Analysts said many industry stakeholders were shocked by the presidency’s announcement of the approval of the deal because the transaction was reportedly declined on July 5 this year by the president who doubles as the Minister of Petroleum Resources and was assisted by Chief Timpre Sylva as Minister of State.

Akwa Ibom Joins Legal Tango

Apart from NUPRC another interested party that kicked against the initial presidential statement on the purported acquisition was the Akwa Ibom State government which warned Seplat Energy against any move to acquire the shallow water assets of ExxonMobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited.

The warning was contained in a statement signed by the state Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice Uko Essien Udom (SAN) and made available to newsmen yesterday in Uyo.

The statement indicated that there is a subsisting restraining order of injunction by the High Court of the state.

The state government noted that ExxonMobil Seplat Energy NNPC Ltd and the Federal Government of Nigeria all have actual knowledge of the suit and the action of the FG is not only contemptuous but infringes on the judicial process of the Akwa Ibom State High Court.

It reads: “Our attention has been drawn to a publication by Femi Adesina Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity) to the effect that President Muhammadu Buhari in his capacity as Minister of Petroleum Resources has consented to the acquisition of shallow water assets of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited by Seplat Energy.

“This is to inform the general public that this proposed transaction is subject to restraining orders of an injunction of the High Court of Akwa Ibom State sitting in Uyo in Suits No. HEK/56/2018

Attorney General of Akwa Ibom State V. Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited and HU/209/2020 Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited V. Governor of Akwa Ibom State & three others.

“ExxonMobil Seplat Energy NNPC Ltd and the Federal Government of Nigeria all have actual knowledge of the court orders having been duly served with the orders and/or various newspaper publications of same.

“This executive interference with the judicial process of a court of competent jurisdiction.

In the Eye of Law

An industry source privy to the deal faulted the presidential endorsement of the Seplat/ExxonMobil deal saying there are relevant portions of the PIA act that vested the authority for approval on the NUPRC.

He stated “Section 95 sub-section 10 of the PIA Act states: “Where the application for an assignment or a transfer of a petroleum prospecting license of petroleum mining lease is refused the commission shall inform the applicant of the reasons for the refusal and may give reasonable time within which further representations may be made by the applicant or by third parties in respect of the application.”

Efforts to get a direct response from the spokesperson for the company Chioma Nwachukwu were rebuffed as she neither picked up her calls nor replied to the Whatsapp messages sent to her.

The indigenous oil firm in a statement signed by its Chief Financial Officer Emeka Onwuka later in the week threatened to take legal action against all the parties that had alleged that Seplat had tried to bribe its way through to the acquisition.

“Seplat Energy has become aware of news and social media reports alleging impropriety in the process of securing ministerial consent to the acquisition of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited by Seplat Energy Offshore Limited.

“Such reports are wholly untrue and the company will pursue legal action against any parties involved in disseminating false information related to its business” the statement said.

However analysts warned that unless the issue is amicably resolved it might affect the further inflow of investment into the nation’s oil sector.

According to the Publisher of Africa Oil and Gas Report Mr Toyin Akinosho one of the issues usually raised during investment road shows abroad is the assurance to foreign investors that they would be able to exit without stress.

He maintained that apart from Seplat which is bound to count its losses ExxonMobil will also not be able to record a smooth exit going by the controversies trailing its deal with Seplat.

“The optics are not good for Nigerian investment drive” he said adding that Seplat may still get the chance to go on with the acquisition. “This might be a delay but not an entire cancellation” he suggested.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3RoZXdoaXN0bGVyLm5nL2FtaWRzdC1leHhvbm1vYmlsLWFzc2V0LWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWNvbnRyb3ZlcnN5LXNlcGxhdHMtbm9uLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1rYXplZW0tcmFpbWktZHVtcHMtZXF1aXR5LWhvbGRpbmdzL9IBjQFodHRwczovL3RoZXdoaXN0bGVyLm5nL2FtaWRzdC1leHhvbm1vYmlsLWFzc2V0LWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWNvbnRyb3ZlcnN5LXNlcGxhdHMtbm9uLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1rYXplZW0tcmFpbWktZHVtcHMtZXF1aXR5LWhvbGRpbmdzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amidst ExxonMobil Asset Acquisition Controversy Seplat’s Non-Executive Director Kazeem Raimi Dumps Equity Holdings,"538 SHARES Share Tweet [mc4wp_form id=33047]

….Investors Ignore Seplat Shares As Traded Volume Decline By Over 96% In One Week

Following the controversy surrounding the share acquisition deal between Seplat Energy and ExxonMobil a Non-Executive Director of Seplat Kazeem Raimi has dumped 16.139 milion ordinary shares of the company that were registered in his name.

Details of the transaction were obtained from the Nigerian Exchange Limited.

This is just as it emerged that many investors on the stock market have started ignoring the shares of the company following the scandal that is currently rocking its share purchase deal with ExxonMobil.

Seplat Energy Plc had in February this year announced an agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited from Exxon Mobil Corporation Delaware for $1.28bn.

The transaction involved the acquisition of ExxonMobil Nigeria’s entire offshore shallow water business.

According to the deal ExxonMobil Nigeria’s shallow water business is an established high-quality operation with a highly skilled local operating team and a track record of safe operations.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited has a pre-emptive right over the asset and had last month won a court decision temporarily blocking Exxon Mobil Corporation from selling assets in Nigeria to Seplat Energy Plc.

A Judge in Abuja had granted NNPC an “order of interim injunction” on July 6 2022 barring Exxon Mobil “from completing any divestment” in a unit that ultimately operates four licenses in Nigeria.

Despite the verdict of the Court reports emerged on Monday that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved that the deal be consummated by Mobil and Seplat.

The Presidency’s announcement of the approval of the deal took many industry players by surprise because the transaction had initially been declined on July 5 this year by the President who is himself the Minister of Petroleum Resources.

Amidst the controversy the President ‘s Spokesperson Garba Shehu said

that the President had taken a decision that the position of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission be supported.

He said the earlier confusion was because “various agencies involved in (the) decision had not coordinated well among themselves.”

An analysis of the transaction statement from the NGX Ltd showed that Raimi has sold 16139 ordinary shares worth N25m registered in his name.

The Director Legal/Company Secretary of SeplatMrs. Edith Onwuchekwa while confirming the transaction said that Seplat had already notified the Exchange about the sale of Raimi’s shares.

She said that the notification was made in accordance with Rule 12 of the Amendments to the Listing Rules of the Nigerian Exchange and Article 19 of the EU Market Abuse Regulations.

With this transaction it therefore implies that Raimi has no stake in Seplat.

She said “The Company was notified of the sale of 16139 ordinary shares registered in the name of Mr. Kazeem Abiodun Raimi a Non- Executive Director of the Company.

”Following this sale Mr. Kazeem Abiodun Raimi holds nil ordinary shares in the Company.

“Notification and Public Disclosure of Transactions by Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibilities (PDMR) and Persons Closely Associated with them is made in accordance with Rule 12 of the Amendments to the Listing Rules of the Nigerian Exchange and Article 19 of the EU Market Abuse Regulations.”

Data from the Exchange showed that 104085 units of Seplat shares were traded on the floor of the stock market on August 4 2022 at a unit price of N1430.5 per share

However the volume of shares traded declined to 3193 units at the same price of N1430.5 per share as of Friday August 12 2022.

This means that while the volume of shares traded declined the price per share remain constant within the eight days period.

A stockbroker who spoke to THE WHISTLER said that the drop in the volume of traded shares of the company may be connected with the controversy rocking its shares acquisition deal with ExxonMobil.

The Stockbroker said “The shares of Seplat has not recorded much activity in the last one week because as you know the market responds to the level of information that it receives from both the domestic and external economic environment.

“You will recall that Seplat has been involved in a controversial deal that involves the acquisition of ExxonMobil shares. Like you know no new investor will want to take position in a company that he is not sure about the level of profitability that will come from such transaction.

“So I think that many investor that had hitherto wanted to take up the shares of the company will hold action pending when this issue with ExxonMobil is resolved. And that is why you saw that only less that 4000 units of shares were traded on Friday.”"

FICO,Fair Isaac,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzEzL3Vwc3RhcnQtY2xhaW1zLW91dHBlcmZvcm0tZmljby1tYXJrZXQtcXVlc3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Upstart Claims It Is Significantly Outperforming FICO but the Market Isn't Buying It,"New data provided by Upstart affirms its technology assesses credit risk better than traditional credit scoring methods.

The second-quarter results from the artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform Upstart (UPST -2.94%) were disappointing and included wide-scale funding issues. But there was one bright spot in the earnings report.

The company showed updated data that indicates its AI-powered loan-underwriting algorithms have been assessing risk significantly better than Fair Isaac's (FICO 3.25%) traditional FICO credit scoring. FICO has been one of the main ways lenders evaluate the credit worthiness of individual borrowers for some time now.

This updated data seem impressive but I'm still a bit skeptical and I think the market is too.

Banks are pulling back

Upstart's whole business model is built on the premise that its technology can assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants better than traditional methods like FICO. This would enable the company to find additional borrowers that haven't historically had access to traditional credit products but are creditworthy while helping banks increase their loan issuance without increasing their default rates. Based on data Upstart provided in its second-quarter earnings materials its models are outperforming FICO by a wide margin.

As you can see above Upstart evaluates loan applicants and assigns them a grade while Fair Isaac's evaluation assigns a numerical score. What the chart shows is those loan applicants who received a high FICO score (deemed more creditworthy) but a low grade from Upstart (less creditworthy) tended to default on loans at a much high rate than applicants who got a low FICO score but a high Upstart grade. Likewise those with a top grade from Upstart didn't default all that much no matter what FICO score they received (the default rate ranged from 0.7% to 1.3%). The outperformance is significantly noticeable in the 639-and-below range where Upstart A+ grades have a default rate of 1.3% and E- grades have a default rate in excess of 14%.

Despite this data indicating Upstart can better assess creditworthiness the number of loans originated by banks and credit unions through Upstart's platform and then retained on their balance sheets really fell off in the second quarter of 2022 with total transaction volume down more than 15% from the first quarter. That was surprising. I was under the impression that most banks and credit unions were using Upstart to originate loans largely to prime borrowers and above. For instance one of Upstart's first and oldest banking partners Customers Bancorp (CUBI 0.97%) disclosed information about its personal loan portfolio in the first quarter of this year and only 1% of the portfolio had a FICO score below 680.

It surprises me that banks and credit unions would pull back so heavily on originating loans to prime buyers and above because credit quality is still quite good among this group and when you consider how widely Upstart is outperforming. There was also plenty of loan demand in the second quarter. Perhaps the 15% drop represented loans to near-prime borrowers and below but I didn't think banks and credit unions were doing this amount of subprime lending with Upstart because they still tend to be quite conservative.

The bond market has no faith right now

The other interesting thing about Upstart is that professional investors apparently have very little faith in the company. In August of 2021 Upstart issued $575 million of senior unsecured convertible notes that are due in 2026. The notes bore an annual interest rate of 0.25% and convert into stock at $285.26 per share.

Recently however due to the falling share price of Upstart and how far away it is from its conversion price the yield to maturity on the bond has risen to 13.9% on Aug. 10. Bond yields and prices are inversely related so as the price of the bond has lost value the yield to maturity has skyrocketed far away from the bond's coupon rate because investors have seemingly lost faith in the model. It's a bit hard for me to believe that professional investors could see Upstart's credit outperformance believe it and still place a yield-to-maturity-rate this high.

Additionally current default rates in Upstart's securitization vintages (loans that have been issued long enough with enough on-time payments made that the risk of default is lower.) issued in 2021 and early 2022 are now underperforming their target gross returns at this point in time. Management has said that this is largely due to the termination of stimulus programs which is no doubt a significant contributor.

But 2021 vintages are performing way worse than pre-pandemic vintages so it's hard to say this is just a reversion to normal. The later vintages are filled with loans to borrowers lower on the credit spectrum and they really just don't seem to be performing well at all.

It might still be too early to tell

I am by no means a data scientist so I cannot definitively say one way or the other whether Upstart's AI underwriting models are outperforming FICO. What I can say is that the market doesn't seem to be buying it right now when you consider the actions of bank partners institutional investors the bond market and the beaten-down stock price.

Upstart could end up outperforming FICO but I still think it is too early right now and therefore I don't know if the data the fintech company provided is enough to make a determination about the true effectiveness of the company's technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9pb3dhLXN0YXRlLWZhaXIvMjAyMi8wOC8xMy9icm9va3MtYW5kLWR1bm4tcGVyZm9ybS0yMDIyLWlvd2Etc3RhdGUtZmFpci1ncmFuZHN0YW5kLWNvbmNlcnQtY291bnRyeS1tdXNpYy8xMDI4NjA3NzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Sounds like we're back in Iowa tonight': Brooks & Dunn boot scoot at the Iowa State Fair,"It had been more than a decade since country duo Brooks & Dunn had rocked the Iowa State Fair Grandstand and on Friday night you could hear how much Iowans were missing the band.

Though the duo has played at the Iowa State Fair nine times since 1992 this marked the first appearance for the performers at the Grandstand since its 2018 renovations.

After bringing hundreds to their feet with their first song of the night ""Brand New Man"" Brooks & Dunn launched into ""Put a Girl in It."" With each song the LED screen at the back of the stage lit the performers with myriad images sometimes projecting the band in sepia tones and other times showing images like a car burning on a highway.

Over decades of performance Brooks & Dunn have created a catalog of 23 chart-topping hits including ""Believe"" ""Only In America"" and ""Cowgirls Don't Cry"" all of which were performed over the course of the night.

Opening for the pair was Alex Miller who was introduced as ""a singer a songwriter and a ball of fire.""

""I know a lot of you are out there going 'Where have I seen this kid?'"" Miller told the crowd after his rendition of ""Good Hearted Woman.""

""I was on 'American Idol' a couple of years ago"" he said. ""It was a crazy experience and I never thought it'd lead to me opening for Brooks & Dunn but I am just so thankful to be here tonight.""

Over the course of the night Brooks & Dunn played about 20 songs including a fan-demanded encore that included ""Boot Scootin' Boogie"" and ""Only America.""

""I gotta thank you all for helping us pay our rent for the past 30 years"" Brooks told the crowd before the encore likely referencing the band's first appearance at the State Fair Grandstand exactly three decades ago.

Later this summer Brooks & Dunn are scheduled to perform at the 15th Annual Academy of Country Music Honors.

Their concert came the day after the alternative Christian band Skillet drew 4537 fans to the State Fair's Grandstand on opening night.

Originally from St. Louis Missouri this wasn't the performer's first time playing in the Hawkeye State. Nelly brought his sound and style to Iowa as recently as last year when he played the Horizon Events Center in Clive where local performer B. Well opened for him.

Ginuwine — an R&B artist with an even longer solo performance career than Nelly — opened.

Though the Grandstand was still filling up when Ginuwine strutted onto the stage while performing ""Hell Yeah"" red rose in hand he was quick to energize the crowd.

""Thank you all for coming to see your boy Ginuwine! ... All those people who've been following me since ’96 I'm gonna see if you know this song right here. Let's go!"" Ginuwine said to a cheering crowd as he moved in front of and off the stage to perform ""I Need A Girl (Pt. 2).""

Ginuwine whose debut album ""Ginuwine... the Bachelor"" turns 26 in October is also a member of TGT with fellow performers Tyrese Gibson and Tank.

For his final song on stage Ginuwine performed ""Pony"" throwing handfuls of red roses to audience members over the course of the song before leaving the stage in a blaze of red and white lights.

For the final performance of the Grandstand that night Nelly and City Spud treated audiences to ""Just a Dream.""

As the song came to an end Nelly threw his hat into the audience as red and yellow lights mixed with flashes of purple and the rappers stepped off stage as the night's fireworks began.

The Golf Channel said Fowler had to finish in the top 11 or better in Memphis to move on next week's BMW Championship. A PGA Tour official clarified that Fowler would actually need to finish in at least a tie for eighth this week based on projections at the time of Fowler's collapse.

Had Fowler parred the No. 18 he would have been 7 under and in range of the top 20 entering Sunday's final round. Instead he took the gallery on No. 18 on quite the adventure.

He hit his tee shot into the water then dropped 221 yards from the pin. He hit his penalty shot into the water and took another drop from 181 yards. A poor approach shot landed 53 feet from the hole. His sixth shot a chip from the fairway landed in the rough. His seventh shot finally ended up on the green.

He missed a 6-foot putt long before registering the second quintuple bogey of his PGA Tour career.

It took three drama-filled playoff holes at the 2022 FedEx St. Jude Championship but Will Zalatoris is finally a winner on the PGA Tour.

He and the other top 70 golfers from TPC Southwind in Memphis Tennessee advance to the next round of the FedEx Cup playoffs at the BMW Championship in Wilmington Delaware. However that was surely far from his mind as he went shot for shot with Sepp Straka down the stretch and finally came out on top after so many narrow misses.

Zalatoris who shot a four-under 66 in Sunday's final round to bring his tournament total to 15 under drained a 10-foot par putt on the 18th that was just shorter than the one he missed that could have forced a playoff at the U.S. Open.

The playoff became a story of surviving poor shots as Zalatoris scrambled to save par following a brutal drive on the second hole only for Straka to do the same after he considered taking his shoes off and hitting from the water's edge before taking a penalty.

Things took another turn on the par-three third playoff hole when Zalatoris' tee shot wedged itself between rocks and the grass and Straka's found the water. The eventual victor took a drop instead of risking catching the rocks with his club face and making things worse and it proved to be the right call when he won with an up-and-down from the drop zone.

Even before the wild playoff there was no shortage of storylines coming into the final round with J.J. Spaun one stroke ahead of Straka and two strokes ahead of Zalatoris Cameron Smith and Trey Mullinax.

Spaun and Straka were both first-time PGA Tour winners this year and a win for either would have been enough to clinch a spot in the FedEx Cup finale at the Tour Championship.

Then there was Zalatoris who was trying to join them as first-time winners. He had come close on the sport's biggest stages with a playoff loss at the PGA Championship a second-place finish at the U.S. Open and a top-10 showing at the Masters earlier this year.

What's more Smith was arguably the biggest story of the entire tournament. There is speculation he will be joining LIV Golf and there was an opportunity for him to become No. 1 in the world with a victory at TPC Southwind following victories at The Players Championship and The Open Championship this year.

""That's been one of my goals probably since the start of the year is to try to get to that top spot"" he told reporters. ""Try and chase it down.""

Yet chasing it down became much more difficult before he even teed off as he was given a two-stroke penalty for ""improper placement of the ball"" upon review of his third round and fell four shots back:

That along with just two birdies from Smith on his way to an even-par 70 opened one more window for challengers to make a run up the leaderboard. It appeared as if Denny McCarthy would be the one to seize the opportunity in the early going with four birdies on the first seven holes to move to 12 under.

One of the birdies even came after he hit the ball into a chair's cup holder:

However McCarthy dropped from contention by shooting four over on the final 11 holes. Adam Scott also got as low as 12 under and was within one stroke of the lead but his chances realistically ended when his tee shot on the 18th found the water to set up a closing bogey.

Elsewhere Collin Morikawa missed a short birdie putt on the 17th also bogeyed the 18th to end a run that saw him climb as low as 12 under while Lucas Glover's bogey on the final hole dropped him to 12 under after he briefly tied for the lead with birdies on the 16th and 17th.

The theme of challengers coming up just short continued when Tony Finau's bid for a third consecutive tournament win after victories at the 3M Open and Rocket Mortgage Classic ended without enough birdies (three) to go with 14 pars.

Throw in Brian Harman bogeying two of the final five holes after tying the lead with a birdie on No. 13 Spaun free-falling down the leaderboard with an eight-over 78 and Mullinax bogeying three of the last four holes and it was a two-man race to the title between Zalatoris and Straka.

Zalatoris caught the first major break when his drive on the par-five 16th kicked out from the trees and into the fairway to set up a birdie.

Straka didn't blink though answering with a birdie on the 16th and a difficult par save on the 17th to set up the eventual playoff.

Zalatoris who birdied the first three holes and seemed to hold on for much of the rest of the round also had a clutch moment on the way to the playoff with the cold-blooded putt to save par on the 18th.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy90b3VybmFtZW50cy8yMDIyLWZlZGV4LXN0LWp1ZGUtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLXB1cnNlL9IBSGh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy90b3VybmFtZW50cy8yMDIyLWZlZGV4LXN0LWp1ZGUtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLXB1cnNlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 FedEx St. Jude Championship purse: Payout info winner’s share in Memphis,"2022 FedEx St. Jude Championship purse: Payout info winner’s share in Memphis

Could Will Zalatoris be on the cusp of his first PGA Tour win at the FedEx St. Jude Championship? Getty Images

We’ve finally reached the final round of play at the 2022 FedEx St. Jude Championship which means we’ve also reached the first payday of the 2022 FedEx Cup Playoffs! Below find everything you need to know about tournament money for the first of the Playoffs’ $75 million prize fund.

FedEx St. Jude Championship final round preview

There’s big money but also big pressure on the line on Sunday at the FedEx St. Jude Championship. In Memphis only the top 70 players by points will advance to the next round of the FedEx Cup Playoffs meaning there’s ground to be gained by nearly everyone in the field heading into Sunday.

J.J. Spaun leads the way through 54 holes at 13 under after three rounds in the 60s to start his week. Trailing closely behind is Sepp Straka (-12) alongside Trey Mullinax (-11). Cameron Smith (-11) is also firmly in contention heading into Sunday’s final round. The reigning Open Champion (and rumored LIV defection) has the opportunity to vault himself near the lead of the FedEx Cup standings with a victory on Sunday.

Further back though is the prohibitive crowd favorite Will Zalatoris. Zalatoris enters Sunday at the FedEx St. Jude looking for his first PGA Tour victory hoping to claim a win after two snakebitten runner-up finishes in two majors in 2022. Zalatoris (-11) is just two strokes back heading into Sunday’s final round.

Of course it’s the FedEx Cup Playoffs which means money is abound. The first piece of the $75 million prize pool will be handed out on Sunday in Memphis a massive $15 million purse. Below find everything you need to know about that money including payout information and winner’s share; you can catch the action from 12-2 p.m. ET on Golf Channel and from 2 p.m. until the completion of play on NBC.

Fifth Third Bank. Even Jungle Jim’s. But Paycor? Who would’ve thought an HR software company would end up buying the naming rights to Paul Brown Stadium?

As it turns out a few people:

Paycor Stadium. Anew name Bengals Stadium. I’m tweeting this in case I’m right I will look like a genius! #paycor #bengals #namingrights — Jeff Schamel (@jeffschamel) July 21 2022

Likely Paycor Stadium with TQL and Great American already in the game — Todd Kelsch (@AtownToby) July 21 2022

@autyelmore Paul Brown Field at Paycor Stadium. — Danny Randall (@randall2583) July 21 2022

Okay that’s it. That’s everyone who saw this coming outside the front office.

So how did it all go down? Well we asked the Bengals director of communications herself Emily Parker. Watch below:

Here is what Parker said about how it all started:

We’ve had a partnership with Paycor since 2018 and as we were starting to look at and explore naming rights we put out some feelers with some of our current partners. Really it started back in March and the conversations took off from there as they immediately expressed interest.

So among the many suitors what made Mike Brown and the rest of the leadership team choose Paycor?

For us it was very important to partner with a company that aligns with our brand... and [we liked] the fact that they’re a local company on the rise. Both us want to get that broader national attention. They went public a year ago and they’re trying to grow their business. This is just a great message to the Cincinnati business community...

We then asked Parker if something like “Paycor Field at Paul Brown Stadium” was in the works so as to maintain the name of the franchise’s founder. “It was important for us for the stadium to have a clear identity” she said. “And so that’s why we wanted it to be a straight naming rights deal instead of trying to incorporate two things into the name.”

Parker also told us that the deal was close for a couple of weeks before it was made public. “I’ve been in my mind calling it Paycor Stadium for a couple weeks now” she said back on August 9 2022 when the interview took place.

And she assured fans that Paul Brown will continue to be honored despite the name change. These efforts include the Ring of Honor the legend’s name on jerseys the Paul Brown coaching excellence award for outstanding high school football coaches and the Paul Brown conference room that is used for signings.

Unfortunately she could not reveal numbers for the financial terms. So we still don’t know how much the added income will help pay for the guaranteed money in upcoming contracts.

Special to Bucs Report

As the Buccaneers prepare to kick off the 2022 season with Saturday’s preseason home opener against the Miami Dolphins the team has unveiled a variety of new offerings that will enhance the gameday experience for Buccaneers fans at Raymond James Stadium.

Unprecedented Demand

In response to an unprecedented demand for 2022 season passes the team announced earlier this offseason an additional seating area named The Krewe’s Nest which will be located in the south end zone at Raymond James Stadium. The additional 3600 seats will increase the stadium’s capacity to nearly 70000. In order to make room for the additional temporary seats the standing room-only fan section on the south end zone concourse has been removed for this season.

Krewe’s Nest

Krewe’s Nest patrons will be able to purchase beverage and food items from the comfort of their seats through food vendors that will be stationed throughout the seating locations. The Buccaneers and Tampa Sports Authority have collaborated to ensure that fans continue to have the ability to cross from the west side of the stadium to the east through a dedicated pass-thru lane that has been established behind the seating platform. Existing restrooms on the south concourse will also remain accessible.

“The addition of The Krewe’s Nest for this season is going to play a huge role in helping us create an unmatched atmosphere for games at Raymond James Stadium” said Buccaneers Chief Operating Officer Brian Ford. “We are always focused on finding ways to create the best gameday experiences for our members and this is another example of that.”

Buccaneers’ Fast Lane

Additionally the team has introduced its first-ever expedited entry lane at Raymond James Stadium through an innovative activation with its partners at Fifth Third Bank. In July the Buccaneers and Fifth Third Bank debuted a team-branded debit card that provides cardholders with a variety of perks including access to the Fifth Third Bank Gate Fast Lane as well as discounts on food and merchandise throughout the stadium.

“With nearly 70000 fans expected at every home game this season the Fifth Third Bank Gate Fast Lane will be a terrific addition to the gameday experience for those cardholders to ensure an efficient and worry-free entry through the gates” said Ford.

More Food More Better

And once inside the stadium Buccaneers fans will be treated to an even greater selection of new and upgraded food offerings from Legends the team’s hospitality rights partner since 2019.

Hyundai Club and East Stadium Club patrons will now have access to food offerings from local favorites PDQ and Aussie Grill in addition to specialty food offerings including a New York strip sandwich pork carnitas tacos calzones and Brauhaus pretzels. On the main concourse new offerings will include a footlong hot dog loaded yucca fries loaded tater tots and bang bang shrimp tatchos. New items in the upper concourse will include a bacon and cheese all beef burger pork carnitas tacos citrus chicken nachos and a portable cart with various healthy food options.

“We know that the quality and selection of food offerings plays a large role in the gameday experience and that is why we have worked closely with our hospitality partners at Legends to continue raising the bar on all food and beverage throughout Raymond James Stadium” said Ford. “Our fans have grown accustomed to enjoying the best hospitality options and we look forward to continuing to exceed their expectations.”

Cashless Experience

As in past years Raymond James Stadium continues to be a cashless facility with all retail transactions requiring a credit or debit card. For the convenience of fans there are reverse cash ATMs located throughout the stadium. All parking lots are also cashless. Fans attending games at Raymond James Stadium are also reminded that there is a no-bag policy in effect for all events.

Today it’s easy to spot solar farms from a mile away often looking like a lake in the distance. Spread out through open fields are rows and rows of photovoltaic modules colloquially called solar panels.

Enel an international renewable energy company began development of the Lily Solar and battery storage site in Kaufman County in 2020. Today it operates 421400 panels on 1400 acres just outside Scurry a town of 690 residents about 40 miles southeast of Dallas.

Most of the sprawling site is used for solar arrays or groups of panels that harness energy from the sun and convert it to usable electricity. The rest of the space is a BESS paddock or battery energy storage system.

Jonathon Parras who has been with Enel for three years and in the renewable energy industry for eight serves as site lead for Lily and manages a small team of technicians who keep the site running smoothly pumping power from the sun onto the Texas grid.

The entire site can be run by as few as two people one for the panels and one for the batteries but on most days there are anywhere from four to 10 technicians who keep an eye on the equipment scientific readings grid conditions and cleaning.

“Everybody needs energy and I feel like if you can source it from something that’s unlimited that’s the best way to do it and provide for everyone” Parras said. “It’s a nice clean source and it’s unlimited.”

The Lily team is just part of the state’s growing solar energy workforce of over 11000. As the industry expands more solar fields are popping up across Texas.

In a field like Lily’s solar cells are combined to create solar modules which when lined up in rows are called solar arrays. Together an array the size of Lily creates 180 megawatts of power — enough to keep the lights on and the air conditioning running in 33000 homes annually.

Inside a solar cell

The workhorses of solar energy are cells stacked with a layer of glass an anti-reflection material a layer of semiconductors and a metal conduction grid plate at the top and bottom.

The top glass layer is for protection keeping out dust dirt and bugs and makes the cells easy to clean.

Advertisement

The anti-reflective material under the glass allows light to pass through but not reflect on the internal metal parts and back out into the environment. That ensures that the panels are collecting as much sunlight as possible.

The metal plates and semiconductors make a sort of electricity sandwich. Metal plates on the top and bottom of the semiconductors allow current to move through them acting as street signs to direct the current.

But the power generation comes from the semiconductors.

Two semiconductor layers sit on top of each other one made of silicon and phosphorus the other of silicon and boron. When light hits the cell it excites electrons in the phosphorus known as valence electrons with enough energy that they break free from their element and go on the search for an element close by that has fewer electrons like boron.

The free-floating electrons bond to boron in the other semiconductor layer creating a migration of electrons between layers. When the electrons move they create energy in the form of a current.

It’s the current that’s harnessed by the metal plates and collected as voltage.

Enel’s arrays are unique because they can collect solar power on both sides of the module.

“They produce from both sides” Parras said. “They can harness energy from the reflection off of the next row or even from the ground. It will increase the production of those cells.”

Getting power on the grid

The next step is getting the voltage from the cells onto the grid a process that requires the power to be transformed to the right voltage.

To do this Parras explained the electricity from solar panels flows along feeder transmission lines bringing the power to a conversion unit. There the power is “cleaned” meaning DC waves are chopped up to create AC waves and sent to a transformer box. In the transformer the power enters on the low side and is “stepped up” to a high side so the voltage matches that of the grid.

All the electricity comes together at the substation where it is prepared to enter the system of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT.

Behind the scenes of a North Texas solar facility 13 images View Gallery

At the substation the electricity goes through batteries where it could be stored indefinitely.

“[Solar] panels provide the solar power to the substation which then goes from the substation to the transformers in the [battery storage] yard and then to the power conversion systems and then to the batteries themselves at which point they are charged” Parras said. “We have the ability to then discharge those batteries as needed or as necessary back onto the grid.”

From the batteries electricity flows to a Rayburn Electric substation and onto the grid.

The Lily facility overproduced what was expected internally from Enel during July meaning it was able to operate as normal and keep all systems online to match demand Parras said.

Unlike a natural gas plant solar fields have built-in downtime at night. Staff completes maintenance at night so the system can stay online during the most productive parts of the day.

By keeping up on maintenance every day Parras said technicians are able to catch potential issues long before they lead to a bigger problem.

“We get ahead of that stuff. We plan for it” he said. “Just like the maintenance we can schedule repairs for nighttime.

The arrays are part of the Wentian experiment module which launched in July. The angle of the panels can also be seen to change to face the sun as the Tiangong space station continues along its orbit.

Wentian's two solar arrays are each nearly 98 feet (30 meters) long. Together they have a total wingspan of over 180 feet (55 meters). Each solar panel has a collecting area of about 1184 square feet (110 square meters).

China plans to launch a third and final module to Tiangong in October. Called Mengtian that experiment module will also carry a pair of large solar arrays similar to those of Wentian.

Three Shenzhou 14 mission astronauts—who are currently aboard Tiangong and preparing for a first extravehicular activity or spacewalk from the Wentian module—will greet the module.

The solar panels are designed to provide power for the Tiangong space station which China plans to keep permanently inhabited by rotating crews of three astronauts for over a decade.

Meanwhile the older larger International Space Station has solar arrays with a wingspan of 240 feet (73 meters) to power its activities in orbit.

When completed Tiangong will be around 20% as massive as the International Space Station which has a mass of about 460 tons.

Now the outer planets are beginning to enter into the configuration of opposition in turn. And Saturn will be the first to do this — its opposition to the Sun which will take place on August 14 will be the first such event this year.

Recall that opposition in astronomy is called such a configuration when the objects involved in it are at opposite points of the celestial sphere. Since there is nothing “absolutely opposite” in this world scientists use a more precise definition: celestial bodies are in opposition when the magnitude of their right ascension differs by exactly 12 hours. This makes it possible to single out the most important of such phenomena — opposition to the Sun. That’s what they mean when they say for example about the “opposition of Mars.”

At this time the object rises in the evening almost simultaneously with sunset culminates at midnight and is above the horizon all night that is it is most convenient to observe it. In the case of planets another important circumstance is added to this: in oppositions the Earth is between them and our luminary which means that their distance to the observer will be the smallest in this period. If a celestial body also happens to be near perihelion the so-called great opposition takes place. Again this term is most often used in relation to Mars the nearest outer planet.

Saturn photographed by the Cassini spacecraft. From Earth it is impossible to see the rings at such an angle and the shadow of the planet on them.

Saturn is now moving along a section of its orbit far from the Sun. On the day of the opposition its heliocentric distance will be 9.862 AU (1 billion 475 million km) it will be separated from the Earth by 8.857 AU (1 billion 325 million km). The brightness of the planet will reach 0.3ᵐ that is it will be very easy to find it against the background of relatively weak stars of the constellation Capricornus. At the latitude of Kyiv the height of Saturn above the horizon at the culmination will be 24°. Noticeably more favorable conditions for its observations will develop in the south of Ukraine.

The reversal of the famous Saturnian rings is gradually decreasing but they are still easy to see in relatively small instruments with magnification of 30× and higher. Saturn is now facing the Earth and the Sun with its north pole. Interestingly a significant increase in the surface brightness of the rings can be observed for several days before and after the opposition. This is due to the fact that they consist of many ice fragments some of which shade each other. When the directions to the observer and the light source coincide (this is what happens in opposition to the Sun) we stop seeing these shadows so the total brilliance of the debris becomes greater. This phenomenon has been called the “opposition effect”.

The next big planet to undergo a opposition configuration in 2022 will be Neptune the planet farthest from the Sun in the Solar System. This will happen on September 16. Even earlier — on August 22 — the asteroid Vesta (4 Vesta) one of the four objects of the Main Asteroid Belt discovered at the beginning of the XIX century will be in opposition.

She passed away on August 7.

“Solar Mama” Tarihing Masnim 52 passed away on August 7 at her village in Kampung Sonsogon Magandai Kota Marudu Sabah.

The late Tarihing became the first Solar Mama in Malaysia after she returned from solar technical training in India and brought electricity to her rural village.

Sabah Daily Express reported that Tarihing’s relative Solboy Majidin conveyed the news of her passing.

According to Solboy husband of the late Tarihing Juprin Marudin 60 found her lying on the ground on his way back from the jungle.

“She was no longer breathing when her husband saw her lying on the ground.

“He did not know that she had gone after him as she would usually wait at home” said Solboy.

The story of Solar Mama

The late Tarihing was a rubber tapper and never received formal education.

Like many other villages in the deep interiors of Sabah her village is cut off from the outside world.

The village is only accessible with off-road vehicles.

Furthermore the village does not have electricity as it is not within the electricity grid.

More than 600 villages in Sabah are off the electricity grid.

Thus growing up without basic amenities has challenged Tarihing and many others in the village.

She and the villagers depend on gasoline lights at night.

Attending Barefoot College

In 2014 Barefoot College founder Sanjit ‘Bunker’ Roy chanced upon Tarihing through Sabah Women Entrepreneurs and Professional Association (Swepa) during one of his visits to Sabah.

He handpicked three women to attend the solar panel installation training in Rajashtan India.

During their training Solar Mamas learn to build install and maintain solar panels and batteries to provide a renewable energy source to their communities.

Because most of these women are illiterate the program uses visual learning tools like colour-coded pictures and manuals.

Nickname “Solar Mama” will be given to them once they complete their training.

However two women dropped out because they had to be in India for six months for the training.

Nevertheless Tarahing braved herself and made her maiden trip overseas to learn about renewable energy.

“If I didn’t go who else will” she asked during one of her early interviews.

Tarihing said she often faced difficulty in communication and technical challenges and most of all missing her family from Sabah.

However she could not bring herself to see her children studying using gasoline lights.

She completed her 6 months of intensive training successfully in 2015 and became a solar engineer.

Tarihing is the first Solar Mama in Malaysia.

Upon returning to the village she successfully lit up 100 houses by installing solar panels and connecting them to solar lanterns distributed to the households.

Furthermore she shared her knowledge with other women in the villages and helped them to replicate by bringing electricity to their village.

Swepa started its Barefoot Solar Project in 2013.

“When we wanted to start the program we did not have to go about it.

“But Bunker Roy sent us all the information and he personally came down to Sabah” said SWEPA’s head of community development Datin Jeannette Tambakau.

Tarihing Masanim was the first Solar Mama followed by Gining Jaineh Rusni Singkamung and recently Inggai Suging.

The four Solar Mamas have provided access to sustainable energy for 300 homes in three villages in Kota Marudu which benefitted around 1500 villagers.

Today her legacy lives on.

Every time light comes on in her rural and nearby villages and people will remember the brave woman who took it upon herself to make life better for others.

Contributed Commentary

Hard to say at this point whether it’ll be for better or for worse but Ohio is approaching a series of big changes depending on November’s election.

Ohio may or may not find itself with a new governor.

Incumbent Republican Mike DeWine is facing Democratic challenger Nan Whaley who was once Dayton’s mayor. But Ohio will for sure have a new U.S. senator. And Ohio’s Supreme Court will have a new chief justice while the Ohio House of Representatives will have a new speaker.

Submit a guest opinion column:Here's how to submit guest opinion columns to the Columbus Dispatch

Meanwhile one thing that seemingly won’t change not unless federal investigators and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio stop seeming to slow-walk it: Less than full disclosure about the FirstEnergy Corp.-House Bill 6 scandal which erupted in mid-2020 and about which questions still linger.

November’s election is 86 days away. Yet Ohio voters at this point have arguably sketchy information on the interplay between DeWine’s administration and HB 6 which Mike DeWine signed as soon as the General Assembly passed it in July 2019.

It’s spattered state legislators of both parties in the General Assembly and the DeWine administration. Yet somehow it all came as a big surprise: Nobody saw anything and nobody knew anything. That’s a bit hard to believe given that governors appoint the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and pick its chairs. Thomas Suddes

The subsidized elephant is still in the room

The federal investigation into House Bill 6 surfaced in July 2020. House Bill 6 originally aimed at subsidizing two money-losing FirstEnergy nuclear power plants still costs Ohio consumers millions of dollars in subsidies for two coal-fueled power plants one in Indiana. Running cost of coal subsidies as of last week: $276 million.

There’s little question the FirstEnergy-House Bill 6 mess is Ohio’s biggest public corruption scandal in 219 years of statehood.

It’s spattered state legislators of both parties in the General Assembly and the DeWine administration. Yet somehow it all came as a big surprise: Nobody saw anything and nobody knew anything. That’s a bit hard to believe given that governors appoint the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and pick its chairs.

The latter include ex-PUCO Chair Samuel Randazzo a DeWine appointee who resigned after the FBI raided his residence. (Ohio’s Senate Republicans and Democrats alike had unanimously confirmed Randazzo to lead the PUCO.)

That raid in November 2020 came four months after a federal grand jury had indicted then-Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder a Perry County Republican on public corruption charges linked to the General Assembly’s passage of House Bill 6. His trial is scheduled to begin next year. Householder is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.

Agreed utility regulation like stock-and-bond law is about as complicated as legal matters can get. And the more lawyers the more billable hours which is why paperwork and procedural falderal clot utility regulation.

Example: The Office of Consumers’ Counsel which represents Ohio’s residential utility consumers in rate cases has no power to issue subpoenas; the PUCO must sign subpoenas for the counsel’s office.

On Thursday after a five-week wait the PUCO through a staff member sent the signed subpoena to the counsel’s office.

The counsel’s office wants to serve the subpoena on FirstEnergy’s former CEO Charles (Chuck) Jones whom the utility fired after the House Bill 6 mess erupted.

Again there’s nothing uncomplicated about utility regulation; the legalese alone is mind-numbing.

And the number of people and entities enmeshed in the House Bill 6 mess – and the PUCO’s workload – might make a five-week delay in the subpoena’s sign-off reasonable. Repeat: Might.

Still every pre-election week eaten up by delays – for whatever reason – is one less week for voters and consumers to learn more before Nov. 8 about how their state government conducted itself in the lead-up to House Bill 6.

DeWine signed a partial repeal of HB 6 in March 2021 junking the latter’s proposed nuclear power subsidies while leaving in place (a) House Bill 6’s subsidies for the two coal-fired plants and (b) sections of House Bill 6 that killed what had been state energy-efficiency and renewable-energy programs.

Yet House Bill 6 has figured hardly at all in this year’s gubernatorial contest except for Whaley’s vow that if voters elect her she will fire the PUCO’s five commissioners among other measures she’d take to protect Ohio consumers while assuring regulatory fairness.

Suddes: Voters kept in the dark on details of House Bill 6 debacle

That’s what has been getting lost – utility regulation in the sunshine and in the public interest including the full story before Election Day of just how House Bill 6 happened.

CLEVELAND — Hours before Machine Gun Kelly was scheduled to take the stage at FirstEnergy Stadium for his much anticipated hometown concert Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb honored MGK's impact on the City of Cleveland.

Mayor Bibb presented MGK with a plaque commemorating August 13 ""Machine Gun Kelly Day"" in Cleveland.

The 32-year-old musician has blown up in popularity over the past decade plus since he exploded into the mainstream. Yet the roots he established in Cleveland have made him one of the highest profile ambassadors for the city throughout his career.

As part of the ""Mainstream Sellout Tour 2022"" the stars are in town tonight to take in what's set to be a memorable night for the Cleveland native.

Blink-182 drummer recently rejoined the tour against his doctor's orders after leaving due to what is described as a ""broken thumb and torn tendons"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbXVzaWMvMjAyMi8wOC9tYWNoaW5lLWd1bi1rZWxseS1mbGllcy1jcmllcy1hbmQtYmxlZWRzLWluLWZyb250LW9mLTUwMDAwLWhvbWV0b3duLWZhbnMtcGhvdG9zLmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2xldmVsYW5kLmNvbS9tdXNpYy8yMDIyLzA4L21hY2hpbmUtZ3VuLWtlbGx5LWZsaWVzLWNyaWVzLWFuZC1ibGVlZHMtaW4tZnJvbnQtb2YtNTAwMDAtaG9tZXRvd24tZmFucy1waG90b3MuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Machine Gun Kelly flies cries and bleeds in front of 50000 hometown fans (Photos),"CLEVELAND Ohio – It’s not often you get to see a rock star cry. In Machine Gun Kelly’s case who could blame him?

There he stood on Saturday night just one song into his concert at FirstEnergy Stadium choked up as 50000 people chanted “MGK MGK MGK!” The kid from Cleveland who came up playing small community shows and venues like Peabody’s Downunder brought his “Mainstream Sellout Tour” to his hometown’s biggest venue.

“Holy s*** Cleveland” he said...Holy s*** indeed.

NEWS UPDATE: Machine Gun Kelly’s epic 2022 Cleveland stadium show gets its own movie: Find showtimes

Machine Gun Kelly emerged on stage just after 9 p.m. hanging from a prop helicopter as he belted out the lyrics to “Born with Horns.” You could barely hear a word he sang over the screams.

“I can’t put into words what I’m feeling right now” Kellz said at the song’s conclusion standing there in pink pants and a huge pink fur coat.

He would spend the night trying to put Saturday’s festivities into words. But the music often spoke for itself. The stadium shook during “Maybe” which was driven by the three-guitar attack of MGK and bandmates – fellow guitarists Justin Lyons and Sophie Lloyd – on an angled checkered stage.

This was Machine Gun Kelly’s biggest hometown concert to date and he was going to pull out all the stops including bringing along a few friends. Avril Lavigne joined MGK on stage for their collaboration “Bois Lie” bringing a huge roar from the crowd.

Lavigne was one of several supporting acts at Saturday’s concert which also included 44phantom Willow and Trippie Redd. Willow (aka Willow Smith the daughter of actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith) arrived on stage at 5:30 p.m. with a full band and massive amounts of energy.

Despite having a normal talking voice that’s close to a whisper Willow’s vocals soared during singalongs of songs like “Wait a Minute!” and the viral hit “Meet Me at Our Spot.” She occasionally apologized for awkward banter like introducing a song called “Maybe It’s My Fault” by saying “This next one is called maybe it’s my fault because you know maybe it is my fault.”

It simply made Willow more endearing to the crowd. She would get her flowers later in the night when she joined Machine Gun Kelly on stage for their single “Emo Girl.”

Next up was Lavigne who turned FirstEnergy Stadium into an early 2000s singalong fest. She performed for just a half-hour but spent that time looking like the queen of Cleveland. Fans swooned along to hits like “Girlfriend” “Complicated” “Sk8er Boi” and “I’m With You.”

During “What the Hell” Lavigne informed the crowd “Alright you beautiful people I wanna hear you sing...” Yet at that point the two-thirds full stadium was already hanging on her every word.

It may have been a bit surprising to see Lavigne two acts ahead of Machine Gun Kelly. But once Canton-native Trippie Redd hit the stage it was clear why it was the right move for her not to follow him.

Redd’s bass-heavy mix of cloud rap and trap sent a sonic earthquake through FirstEnergy Stadium. You’d hear the countdown “1 2 3 4″ and the venue would shake repeatedly.

Despite being the only one on stage – no band no hype man – Redd put on what felt like a massive rock concert without seeming like he was even trying. He left the stage numerous times more concerned with relighting his blunt than singing.

Redd admitted he was “drunk as f***” (which was clear to everyone from the onset). But it didn’t matter. Fans sang along to every massive song -- from “Dark Knight Dummo” to “F*** Love” to “Miss the Rage” -- as bursts of flames surrounded the stage. It was a great setup for the night’s main attraction MGK.

Somehow during a brief break in his set Machine Gun Kelly managed to run to the back of the stadium and change his clothes. He reappeared in front of a spotlight in the upper deck. Kellz rapped “Alpha Omega” a capella before zip-lining his way above the crowd back towards the stage.

It was a breathtaking moment that took A LOT of work. Days earlier Machine Gun Kelly suggested the idea to event organizers only to be shot down. He reached out to Mayor Justin Bibb – who had declared Aug. 13 “Machine Gun Kelly Day” -- which led to MGK raising $10 million in insurance money to make the stunt happen.

It was just the beginning of an epic night that would go well past 11 p.m. highlighted by standout moment after standout moment. Flames blasted during “More Than Life.” A portion of the stage rose several feet in the air with MGK atop it to perform “Floor 13.” More fireworks shot into the sky.

Midway through his set Machine Gun Kelly brought out Travis Barker to play drums. The Blink-182 star who has produced Kellz’s last two pop-punk albums has been on the mend from pancreatitis. At times Barker looked completely exhausted. But a quick flex and crotch grab while on the big screen let the crowd know he was game.

Together with MGK Barker drove the night’s liveliest stretch. They performed the standout songs from 2020′s “Tickets to My Downfall” including “Kiss Kiss” “Concerts for Aliens” and “All I Know.” During “Bloody Valentine” Machine Gun Kelly brought a group of young children from the pit on stage to rage alongside him. It was a moment of pure joy.

Later Machine Gun Kelly moved to a B-stage towards the other end of the stadium’s field. He was joined by members of Cleveland’s Contemporary Youth Orchestra for “Glass House” and “Lonely” the latter of which brought Kellz to tears again as he dedicated the song to his late father and aunt.

Soon after however things went off the rails a bit. In all the night’s excitement Machine Gun Kelly decided to recreate a moment from earlier in the tour where he smashes a champagne glass on his face (because you know he didn’t have a fork to tap it with).

Machine Gun Kelly bled from the middle of his forehead down his nose with a smile on his face. It was a strange and unnecessary moment that signaled the night had perhaps gone on a bit too long. Soon more fireworks filled the sky after “Twin Flame” bringing an end to a special show.

Throughout the night Machine Gun Kelly bemoaned the Internet for serving as a platform for haters to gang up on him for much of his career. But FirstEnergy Stadium was void of any detractors.

Whether you love Machine Gun Kelly or hate him there’s no way to deny Saturday night – which saw a hometown guy sellout (or come very close to it) an NFL stadium – was one of the great moments in Cleveland music history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWFjb25qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wvMjAyMi8wOC8xMy9jdXlhaG9nYS12YWxsZXktY2hyaXN0aWFuLWFjYWRlbXktcm95YWxzLXdpbGwtbGUtcHJpbmNpcGFscy1hdGhsZXRpYy1jb25mZXJlbmNlLWluLWZhbGwtMjAyNS1vaHNhYS82NTQwMjgwMDAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cuyahoga Valley Christian Academy will leave the Principals' Athletic Conference,"After spending the past 21 years with the Principals’ Athletic Conference Cuyahoga Valley Christian Academy has announced it will say goodbye.

CVCA president Jason Spodnik submitted a letter of withdrawal earlier this month to begin the two-year transition on July 1 2022 as stated by the PAC-7 bylaws.

The Royals are not requesting an early release which leads to a maximum three-year transition. That means the 2024-25 school year will be the last for season for CVCA as a member of the PAC-7.

Top-shelf Talent:CVCA's Darryn Peterson is drawing some attention from the greatest college basketball programs in the country.

A hero and a talent:Braden Hahlen overcomes nearly tragic accident is inspiration to CVCA teammates.

The conference was formed in 1989 and has been the athletic home for high schools in Stark Summit Tuscarawas and Wayne counties.

Along with CVCA the conference includes Canton South Fairless Manchester Northwest Orrville Triway and Tuslaw high schools.

CVCA is the only private school to have been involved with the PAC-7 having joined in 2001.

“There were two reasons” CVCA Athletic Director Jon Young said. “One geographically the distance was a challenge for us. The second reason was size. CVCA was the one of the bigger schools. Those factors were big for us in trying to figure out what we wanted to do moving forward.

“It was a very tough decision. We’re very grateful to the PAC and the relationships we’ve formed with the schools over the years. They took a chance on us 21 years ago being a private school. We were kind of an oddball. We wish those schools the best of luck moving forward. We’re excited what the future holds for them and for CVCA as well.”

What is the next step for the Royals?

The three-year cushion will be crucial for the Royals who don’t have a conference after 2024-25.

The Portage Trail Conference Suburban League Metro Athletic Conference would make sense logistically but talk of joining any of those leagues is well down the road.

“Obviously our desire is not to be independent” Young said. “We don’t have anywhere to land quite yet. Our options are open. We’re going to evaluate what’s out there and see what’s next.

“In a perfect world we’d have it wrapped up sooner rather than later. We understand that these things take time. In my perfect world we’d have this wrapped up in the next school year. We realize that may not be reality.”

What's the next step for the Principals' Athletic Conference?

The request was accepted and administrators from the conference schools will meet later this fall to discuss the next steps for the league.

“The league appreciates the long relationship the PAC-7 has had with CVCA over the last two decades” PAC commissioner Gary Woods said in a press release. “We understand their request and wish them well during and after the transition. The PAC-7 schools will continue to compete and utilize our competitive relationships for the betterment of our student-athletes.

“CVCA certainly added to the level of competition in the conference. Moving forward the league will continue building on the health of our programs providing fair and spirited opportunities for our schools students and fans.”

The techs were honored with a special eye-catching livery on Harrison Burton’s No. 21 Ford Mustang run on August 7th 2022.

The weekend’s festivities celebrated the Ford technicians all of whom achieved the 20-year Senior Master status mark in 2019 or 2020. Their names were emblazoned on the side of Burton’s Mustang race car within the wrench decal spanning the car’s rear quarter panel and doors. Burton himself visited the technicians stopping by for a brief speech and to sign autographs and take photos with them. The memorable event marked the first time since 2019 that Ford technicians were able to attend the race at Michigan that honored their loyalty and long-standing relationships with The Blue Oval.

“We were so excited to bring back this memorable experience for our 20-year Senior Master Technicians” said Elizabeth Tarquinto Manager of Technical Service Operations in the Ford Customer Service Division. “The partnerships we have with Motorcraft/Quick Lane Racing and the legendary Wood Brothers Team made this very special. We thrive as a company thanks to the tremendous service that our technicians provide.”

The Cup Series race served as the culmination of the Motor City Homecoming weekend which began on Friday night with a welcome dinner hosted by Ford Motor Company executives. Saturday’s festivities included a tour of the Ford Rogue Electric Vehicle Center and a trip to the Henry Ford along with an exclusive recognition ceremony at Ford Field.

The Ford technicians in attendance were certainly treated to a show at Michigan International Speedway as Kevin Harvick’s No. 4 Mustang rocketed ahead of the pack after a late-race restart to capture his first victory in 65 races. Burton’s No. 21 Mustang meanwhile came home in 32nd.

Michael Wayland / CNBC

SPRING HILL Tenn. – Jack Weaver can point to a cannon on a Civil War battlefield from the comfort of a shaded bench in his backyard — a visible marker of his land's rich past. As he speaks about his small town it's over the loud rumble of cars and trucks at the intersection in front of his farmhouse red home. The 82-year-old retired dairy farmer has lived in Spring Hill nearly his entire life. He's watched the once-quiet town in middle Tennessee grow into a burgeoning Nashville suburb. The evolution of Spring Hill has come in conjunction with a population boom in the state as well as the introduction of new industries — in particular auto companies — that have poured billions of dollars in new investments into the state. ""It's good and it's bad"" says Weaver who complains about cars hitting his fence and the traffic General Motors' Spring Hill plant has brought since it opened in 1990. ""I'm not against development at all. I'm not. I think a man outta do what he wants with his own land."" Detroit is the city that ""put the world on wheels"" but it's towns like Spring Hill and others in neighboring states that are attracting the most investments from automakers in recent years as production priorities shift to a battery-powered future with electric vehicles. Companies more than ever want to build EVs where they sell them because the vehicles are far heavier and more cumbersome to ship than traditional models with internal combustion engines. They also want facilities for battery production to be close by to avoid supply chain and logistics problems. Among the first to invest in southern states was Ford Motor in the 1950s and 1960s in Kentucky followed by foreign-based or transplant automakers starting with Nissan Motor which established a plant in Smyrna Tennessee in 1983. Others such as General Motors  Subaru Toyota Motor and BMW followed suit through the 1990s. More have followed since then including recent announcements by Hyundai Motor and Rivian Automotive to build multibillion-dollar plants in Georgia.

As more companies look to the American South the investments are changing the landscape of towns across the region and of the automotive industry's workforce supply chain and logistics. Companies first to set up shop in the South earn early advantages over their northern competitors and future newcomers according to officials. Auto executives say they're investing in the South for a combination of reasons: lower energy costs available workforce and livability among them. Many southern states also come with other benefits potentially controversial such as all-in lower pay for workers millions in tax breaks and a largely non-unionized workforce in many of the Republican-controlled right-to-work states. But the shift brings unique challenges too. As the Motor City moves and expands south it has to grapple with preservation of historic plantation farms unearthing of slave burial grounds and pushback from citizens and local politicians who aren't used to the traffic or industries.

Investments shifting

Automakers have announced $45.9 billion of investments in southern states since 2017 according to The Center for Automotive Research a nonprofit think tank based in Ann Arbor Michigan. That's the first year the South outpaced the Midwest or Great Lakes region for announced investments since at least 2010. Midwest states such as Michigan Ohio and Indiana saw $39.9 billion in announced investments in that same timeframe. Most of the money heading south – $34.2 billion or 74% – has come in since last year from traditional automakers such as GM Hyundai and Ford Motor as well as EV startup Rivian. Others such as Volkswagen and Nissan continue to invest and expand their operations in the South largely for new electric vehicles. ""We are basically undergoing the single biggest industrial transformation I would say not to understate it in the history of America"" Scott Keogh CEO at Volkswagen of America told CNBC in June at the automaker's new battery lab in Chattanooga Tennessee. ""It's happening right now in this area.""

Keogh singled out energy capacity and costs as the top priority for the company's investments in Tennessee including the potential for new assembly and battery facilities that the company is ""actively"" scouting locations for. He and other executives have also cited incentives tax support labor and workforce training as other key elements. Ford CEO Jim Farley put a similar emphasis on the cost and availability of energy in September announcing an $11.4 billion investment in new vehicle and battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky. ""We want to work with states who are really excited about doing that training and giving you access to that low energy cost"" Farley told the Associated Press then. Tennessee has among the lowest electricity prices in the country according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state's average industrial price of electricity per kilowatt-hour was 6.31 cents as of May. Michigan's industrial energy cost was 8.72 cents per kilowatt-hour and the national average was 8.35 cents. Mississippi and South Carolina were under 7 cents while Georgia was 9.05 cents – among the highest in area according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. While those cost differences seem minimal they add up quickly. Ford's new battery plants will have an annual capacity for 43 megawatt-hours of production. There are 1000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a megawatt-hour meaning tens of thousands of dollars in savings per year. The expansion south is expected to continue for years to come according to AlixPartners. The global consulting firm expects investments from automakers and suppliers in southern states such as Alabama Georgia and Kentucky to total $58 billion for electric vehicles between 2022 and 2026. That's nearly four times the $15 billion that's expected in Midwest states and $20 billion elsewhere in the country. ""It definitely will change but right now there's a lot more interest and activity happening in the Southern states particularly with all these automakers making investments on the EV front"" said Arun Kumar a managing director in the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.

Southern hospitality

State economic development officials from Tennessee and Georgia say their states have made the automotive industry a priority because of the supply chain jobs that typically follow. They also say electric vehicles have helped to level the playing field for new investments. ""This is almost like a seed field of opportunity as this industry changes because we're building the supply chain in the United States for electrification from scratch"" said Pat Wilson commissioner of Georgia's economic development unit. ""There's a huge amount of opportunity."" As of July EV-related projects contributed more than $12.6 billion in investments and more than 17800 new jobs in Georgia since 2020 officials said. Tennessee reports automotive companies have added more than 43800 new jobs and invested $16.5 billion in private capital in the state since 2012 representing nearly 30% of private capital investments during that time.

With billions of dollars on the line and tens of thousands of new jobs states have offered enormous incentive packages for the companies in the forms of land tax abatements/incentives and other support such as installation of utilities and roadways. For example Tennessee approved an $884 million incentive package for Ford's plans to spend $5.6 billion in the state as well as in-kind services and a $2 million grant for training services. Ford's investment includes a new electric truck plant and battery facility with supplier South Korea-based SK Innovation. Bob Rolfe who oversees The Volunteer State's economic development said such actions are needed to compete with others. He said to attract Ford last year the state spent years accumulating enough land for an ""electric vehicle mega site"" ahead of securing the automaker's commitment. ""We tell our team every day to continue to recruit. Is enough enough?"" Lewis said ahead of a trip to Japan for automotive recruitment in June. ""The more great companies that call Tennessee home the softer the landing when we do hit the next wind shear that's going to be developed around the next recession.""

Unique issues

But not all agree that the automotive industry should be expanding South into rural areas. Rivian has faced notable pushback since announcing plans last year to build a $5 billion plant about 45 miles east of Atlanta Georgia. While hailed by many politicians including Gov. Brian Kemp local news outlets report residents of the rural area are concerned with how it will impact their community. Others including politicians oppose a $1.5 billion in tax breaks and other incentives that state and local officials have offered Rivian.

Haynes Haven is a historic landmark in Spring Hill Tennessee that has been maintained by GM since the automaker built an assembly plant near the site in the 1980s.

""[Union Army General] Sherman and his troops destroyed our community. Now this supposedly green company is coming to destroy it again"" JoEllen Artz told NBC News in May. Artz is president of the grassroots No2Rivian group which says it has raised over $250000 and hired Atlanta lawyers to fight the plant. ""We want to keep it just like it is."" Building massive assembly plants in traditionally rural areas can also involve a unique set of challenges. Decades ago when GM was building its Spring Hill plant the company unearthed an unmarked slave graveyard. GM paid for the remains to be moved to a nearby burial site. ""When we invest in properties we're also investing in communities their history and culture"" GM said in an emailed statement to CNBC. ""With any building or renovation project we expect to encounter the unexpected and we try to work with community members to find solutions to fit the unique needs of each situation. In many cases like in Spring Hill the unexpected finds become intertwined in our own history as well."" It wasn't the first time GM has operated around such a site. On the property of its Detroit-Hamtramck plant there's an active Jewish graveyard that the company agreed to build around when it built the plant in the 1980s. There was reportedly another cemetery moved in Smyrna Tennessee – located about 28 miles northeast of Spring Hill – when Nissan's plant and railroads were built there in the early 1980s.

Since GM's Spring Hill Assembly plant was built the company also has maintained two historic plantations as part of land deals struck during the construction. It still maintains one called Haynes Haven whose historic horse stables were turned into a welcome center and used for other events. The surrounding area is currently being used for employee parking during construction of the company's new $2.3 billion battery plant next to the original plant. The other site called Rippavilla sits across the street from the plant and was donated by the company to the city in 2016. It is now being run by a nonprofit organization The Battle of Franklin Trust committed to Civil War preservation and education. ""The last people that owned Rippavilla were pretty insistent that they wanted it to be a historic site. They did not want to happen to what happened to Haynes Haven which Haven is owned by GM and able to use however they see fit"" said Eric Jacobson CEO of the organization. Jacobson credits GM with saving and maintaining the site in the form of $100000 a year up until 2016 when a 10-year deal to maintain the property ended. GM said it continues to support the site.

Battling the union

While the automakers may have to navigate battlefields of the South they don't have to worry as much about battling unions. The United Auto Workers has failed to successfully organize a non-Detroit automaker plant in the South despite decades of attempts. The prominent union also now faces challenges of organizing joint venture battery plants from GM and Ford in the South. ""It's a very critical time for the UAW"" Ray Curry president of the union told CNBC. ""This transformation piece is about our future. It's about 86-plus years of longstanding history.""

Ford's more than $11.4 billion investment to build new U.S. facilities in Tennessee and Kentucky is expected to create nearly 11000 jobs to produce electric vehicles and batteries. Both GM and Ford officials have said the decision of whether to unionize at their U.S. battery plants which are joint ventures will be left to the workers. While the labor cost gap has narrowed between the Detroit automakers and other non-unionized automotive plants organized labor costs are higher for the companies. At the end of a current four-year contract between the Detroit automakers and UAW in 2023 the Center for Automotive Research estimates average hourly labor costs per worker will be $71 for GM; $69 for Ford; and $66 for Stellantis  formerly Fiat Chrysler. ""There's quite a bit of anti-union attitude that prevails in the international carmakers"" said James Rubenstein a professor emeritus at the University of Miami Ohio who specializes in the automotive industry. ""It's a little bit easier to do that down South to keep the union out.""

Werden1

Assistant Attorney General (“AAG”) in charge of the Antitrust Division Jonathan Kanter vowed that “if the facts and the law and a careful analysis of Department policies guiding our use of prosecutorial discretion warrant a criminal Section 2 charge the Division will not hesitate to enforce the law.”2 This article reviews history precedent and other considerations to shed light on what AAG Kanter might do and it ponders the question: What would be the point?

I. SHERMAN ACT CRIMES

Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act created four misdemeanors. Section 1 created just one — to contract combine or conspire in restraint of trade3 while Section 2 created three — to monopolize to attempt to monopolize and to conspire to monopolize.4 Consistent with the misdemeanor designation the crimes originally carried the maximum prison sentence of one year.

From 1890 to 1955 Sherman Act prosecutions were common but prison sentences were reserved for exceptional cases5 and the maximum fine was just $5000. From 1955 to 1974 the maximum fine was $50000. And in 1974 the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (“APPA”) increased the maximum fine for an individual to $100000 and the maximum fine for a corporation to $1 million. Critically the APPA also made Sherman Act violations felonies.6

The felony provisions of the APPA were a last minute addition long after the legislative hearings. On October 8 1974 President Gerald Ford revealed his plan to Whip Inflation Now.7 The plan included higher antitrust fines and a vow to “zero in on more effective enforcement against price fixing and bid rigging.”8 The President mentioned neither jailing offenders nor enforcement of Section 2. The October 11 House report on the APPA noted the President’s support for higher fines.9

Thomas E. Kauper the AAG in charge of the Antitrust Division then publicly stated that the Administration would propose making antitrust violations felonies.10 The Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Peter Rodino encouraged the proposal11 and it was made official on November 8.12 Chairman Rodino inserted the felony provision in the House bill on November 19 and the House immediately passed it. The Senate followed.

The Antitrust Division has actively and successfully prosecuted hard-core cartels as felonies racking up approximately 2000 prosecutions.13 The Division however appears never to have undertaken a felony Section 2 prosecution.14

Judges remained reluctant to incarcerate ordinary antitrust offenders after the APPA made them felons.15 Of the many things the Antitrust Division did to enhance cartel deterrence the most consequential might have been persuading the United States Sentencing Commission that cartel offenses merited substantial prison sentences and that fines should be tied to volume of commerce rather than actual impact.16

II. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES

The Sherman Act is somewhat problematic as a criminal law. The Supreme Court addressed its lack of specificity in the 1913 case of Nash v. United States17 which involved concerted exclusionary conduct criminally charged under both Section 1 and Section 2. The Court observed that a criminal law requires “some definiteness and certainty.”18 But the Court rejected the contention that the rule of reason under which legality turns on competitive impact lacked the requisite definiteness explaining that common law sometimes criminalized conduct on the basis of consequences that were neither intended nor foreseen.19

A year after the Nash decision the Supreme Court first declared a law void for vagueness.20 That law was Kentucky’s antitrust law which resembled Section 1 of the Sherman Act except for the additional proviso that conduct was prohibited only if it caused prices to depart from “real value.”21 International Harvester incurred multiple convictions as a result of the 1902 merger creating the company while Kentucky tobacco farmers were allowed to cooperate under the proviso’s protection.22 The Supreme Court struck down the law because determining “real value” was “a problem that no human ingenuity could solve.”23 Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes contrasted the Sherman Act where “a great body of precedents on the civil side coupled with familiar practice make it comparatively easy for common sense to keep to what is safe.”24

The Supreme Court struck down Colorado’s criminal antitrust law in 1927.25 Colorado had a Section 1–like prohibition but carved out conduct necessary to make a reasonable profit and the Supreme Court agreed with the district court that enforcement of the law violated the Due Process Clause due to the vagueness of the carve out.26 Chief Justice William Howard Taft further asserted that under the Sherman Act “the common law precedents as to what constituted an undue restraint of trade were quite specific enough to advise one engaged in interstate trade and commerce what he could and could not do under the statute.”27

In the foregoing quotations Taft and Holmes were describing only Section 1. The common law had been very tolerant of exclusionary conduct28 and Sherman Act precedent did not make clear what conduct was safe. In an important case decided the term before the Colorado case the Court explained that it had upheld criminal laws employing “words or phrases having a technical or other special meaning well enough known to enable those within their reach to correctly apply them or a well-settled common law meaning.”29 That too described Section 1 but to “monopolize” had no special meaning when the Sherman Act was written.30

Recent cases are instructive as to how the Sherman Act would be viewed today. In 2015 the Supreme Court struck down a law increasing the prison terms of defendants with three prior convictions for “violent felonies” and the Court rejected the notion that “a vague provision is constitutional” if “there is some conduct that clearly falls within the provision’s grasp.”31

In 2018 the Court struck down a similar provision in immigration law.32 Writing for the Court Justice Elena Kagan explained:

The prohibition of vagueness in criminal statutes . . . is an essential of due process required by both ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law. The void-for-vagueness doctrine as we have called it guarantees that ordinary people have fair notice of the conduct a statute proscribes. And the doctrine guards against arbitrary or discriminatory law enforcement by insisting that a statute provide standards to govern the actions of police officers prosecutors juries and judges. In that sense the doctrine is a corollary of the separation of powers—requiring that Congress rather than the executive or judicial branch define what conduct is sanctionable and what is not.33

In 2019 the Court struck down a provision of the Hobbs Act enhancing the sentence for a “crime of violence” even though the Act provided a useful definition of the term.34 Writing for the Court Justice Neil Gorsuch explained:

Our doctrine prohibiting the enforcement of vague laws rests on the twin constitutional pillars of due process and separation of powers. Vague laws contravene the first essential of due process of law that statutes must give people of common intelligence fair notice of what the law demands of them. Vague laws also undermine the Constitution’s separation of powers and the democratic self-governance it aims to protect. Only the people’s elected representatives in the legislature are authorized to make an act a crime. Vague statutes threaten to hand responsibility for defining crimes to relatively unaccountable police prosecutors and judges eroding the people’s ability to oversee the creation of the laws they are expected to abide.35

Since Sherman Act violations were made felonies the Department of Justice generally has confined felony antitrust prosecutions to hard-core cartel activity.36 That practice minimized the risk of successful constitutional challenges37 because “[o]bjections to vagueness under the Due Process Clause rest on the lack of notice and hence may be overcome in any specific case where reasonable persons would know that their conduct is at risk.”38 Hard-core cartel activity was very clearly held to be unlawful per se in the 1940 decision United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.39 and that decision asserted that the per se rule had been in effect for more than forty years.40

Confining criminal Sherman Act enforcement to conduct that clearly is subject to the per se rule addresses the vagueness problem41 but it highlights a separation-of-powers issue. Criminalizing conduct is an exercise of legislative power and the Constitution vests all legislative power in the Congress.42 Congress however neither crafted the per se rule nor made the policy judgment to confine prosecution to conduct within the per se rule. The present conservative majority on the Supreme Court might view this as impermissible delegation.

The Supreme Court has not struck down a law for impermissible delegation since 1935 but it considered doing so in a 2019 case concerning the constitutionality of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.43 No opinion commanded allegiance from a majority of the eight-member court. Writing for the four liberals voting to uphold the Act Justice Kagan explained that “a nondelegation inquiry always begins (and often almost ends) with statutory interpretation. The constitutional question is whether Congress has supplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee’s use of discretion.”44 Justice Gorsuch joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas took issue with the “intelligible principle” approach to the extent that it allowed the Executive Branch to “make the policy judgments.”45

Any person charged with a felony in a typical Section 2 case would have a solid due process argument based on the lack of fair notice. The Supreme Court has not declared any exclusionary conduct to be unlawful per se.46 Indeed the Court has not articulated a consistent principle for separating legitimate competition from illegitimate exclusion. And of course the Department of Justice has no history of felony prosecutions under Section 2.

The argument that fair notice was not provided would lose much of its power if the alleged conduct involved violence. When AAG Charles F. Rule explained in detail the Antitrust Division’s criminal enforcement policy in 1988 he cited conduct involving violence or the threat of violence as the only possible exception to the general rule that criminal enforcement of the Sherman Act is confined to hard-core cartel activity.47 Historical examples of such cases are discussed in the next section.

III. CHARGING BOTH SECTION 1 AND SECTION 2 VIOLATIONS

AAG Kanter might be looking for a case presenting concerted conduct that can be charged under both Section 1 and Section 2 and history offers several examples. One is the Nash case mentioned above.48up> The defendants were convicted under both Section 1 and Section 2 for concerted exclusionary conduct. The court did not impose two separate sentences nor was any defendant sentenced to more the statutory maximum for a single count.49 The trial court likely believed that the same conspiracy had been charged under both Section 1 and Section 2.

In United States v. MacAndrews & Forbes Co. a few years earlier the defendants had been separately sentenced on two Sherman Act counts and in total each was fined more than the statutory maximum.50 The trial court held that the Section 1 and Section 2 offenses were distinct because the Section 1 offense was the defendants’ agreement while the Section 2 violation was their overt acts.51 An oft-stated principle is that a “substantive crime and a conspiracy to commit that crime are not the ‘same offence’ for double jeopardy purposes.”52 This principle applies even though the overt acts further the unlawful agreement.

All four Section 1 and 2 crimes were charged in a few cases. In 1933 the Antitrust Division secured Sherman Act indictments in five racketeering cases alleging cartels enforced through violence. In two cases involving furs those charged included Louis “Lepke” Buchalter and Jacob “Gurrah” Shapiro the only subjects of FBI wanted posters for antitrust violations.

Lepke was convicted on all counts in both cases but successfully appealed his convictions. He then entered into plea bargains under which he was sentenced in each case to two concurrent one-year prison terms one for violating Section 1 and one for violating Section 2. As a practical matter the most notorious criminal ever convicted under Section 2 did not serve a single day as a result. But Lekpe was convicted of other crimes and he was executed in 1944 for a murder committed shortly before his first antitrust trial.

Gurrah was convicted on all counts in both cases and the convictions withstood appellate review. In the first case he was sentenced to three concurrent one-year terms for the Section 2 violations as well as one year for the Section 1 violation. The Section 1 and Section 2 sentences ran consecutively which he argued violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. But the Second Circuit held that the Section 1 conspiracy was distinct from the Section 2 conspiracy.53

In the second case Gurrah’s sentence was the same except that the Section 2 sentences for monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize also ran consecutively. He argued on appeal that the consecutive Section 2 sentences violated the Double Jeopardy Clause54up> but the court invoked the principle that a substantive crime and a conspiracy to commit that crime are not the same offence for double jeopardy purposes.

American Tobacco Co. v. United States (1946)55 was similar to the racketeering cases in that the three big tobacco companies and twelve of their executives were convicted of all four crimes under Section 1 and Section 2. The Supreme Court held that “§§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act require proof of conspiracies which are reciprocally distinguishable from and independent of each other although the objects of the conspiracies may partially overlap.”56

The Court did not explain how this requirement was satisfied most likely because the sole question presented was whether the monopolization offense required actual exclusion of competitors. But the Supreme Court and appellate opinions in American Tobacco clearly described distinct Section 1 and Section 2 conspiracies. The evidence showed that the defendants targeted the upstart ten-cent brands57 rigged bids in purchasing leaf tobacco58 and controlled retail prices.59

In American Tobacco the Court cited Blockburger v. United States holding that: “The applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.”60 Applying this rule the Court has held for example that a man who stole a car then drove it could not be prosecuted for both auto theft and joyriding.61

The Blockburger test permits adding a Section 2 conspiracy count to a cartel indictment if the indictment alleges two distinct conspiracies with two distinct objects and of course the object of the Section 2 conspiracy must be exclusion. Adding a Section 2 monopolization or attempt to monopolize count is permissible with overt acts of exclusionary conduct.62 A court is unlikely to entertain a novel and expansive reading of Section 2 because the “rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them.”63

If a person were convicted of violating both Section 1 and Section 2 the issue of sentence would remain. All of the cases discussed above were concluded before the creation of the United States Sentencing Commission. Section 3D1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines now provides that “[a]ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together.”64 Thus adding a Section 2 conviction to a Section 1 conviction would enhance the Guidelines sentence only if the conduct charged under Section 2 was shown to produce harm distinct from that flowing from the conduct charged under Section 1.65

IV. CONCLUSION

AAG Kanter should expect an immediate constitutional challenge on due process and separation of powers grounds if he indicts someone in a typical Section 2 case. And he should expect things to go badly. A decision to prosecute in an otherwise insignificant case could turn it into the most consequential case in antitrust history.

And what could be accomplished if a Section 2 prosecution were to go off without a hitch? While a civil Section 2 case opens the door to the full panoply of equitable remedies including corporate restructuring a criminal case is just about punishment. But no judge would imprison a businessperson for non-violent exclusionary conduct and any fine would be trivial compared to those routine in the EU. So what would be the point?

Mfrs.’ Ass’n of Relocatable Bldg. Indus. 462 F.2d 49 52 (9th Cir. 1972). The jury decides the two questions of fact: whether a defendant entered into an agreement and whether it was within the scope of the per se rule. The per se rule holds that price fixing bid rigging and market allocation are inherently unreasonable because they necessarily stifle competition. The per se rule is a special case of the rule of reason under which only competition matters. See Gregory J. Werden Antitrust’s Rule of Reason: Only Competition Matters 79 ANTITRUST L.J. 713 (2014).

An image of the judge was tacked onto an old photo of Jeffrey Epstein getting a foot rub by Ghislaine Maxwell.

Fox News aired a digitally altered photo that replaced an old image of Jeffrey Epstein getting a foot rub from Ghislaine Maxwell with the body and face of the federal judge who signed off on the warrant allowing FBI agents to search former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago.

The altered photo — originally an image of the late convicted sex offender Epstein cozying up to convicted sex trafficker Maxwell on a private jet — was broadcast during ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Thursday while Fox News' Brian Kilmeade was serving as guest host.

""Also a picture of Bruce Reinhart"" Kilmeade said during the segment as the fake image showing Reinhart — a magistrate judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida — was shown to viewers.

In the photo Reinhart can be seen with a box of Golden Oreos and a bottle of Early Times whiskey in his right hand. Epstein's upper body in the image was replaced with Reinhart's.

""This is the judge in charge of the of the of the um as you know of the warrant and we'll see if he's going to release it next — he likes Oreos and whiskey"" Kilmeade said during the broadcast.

During the broadcast Kilmeade asked Fox News' Sean Hannity whether he can ""relate to that"" prompting Hannity himself to call out the photo for being altered.

""I think that's actually a picture of Jeffrey Epstein with somebody putting [Reinhart's] head on there"" Hannity told Kilmeade adding ""I'm guessing I don't know.""

Kilmeade responded ""It might be his plane. Who knows?""

""I'll let you determine that in the morning. We'll be watching"" a chuckling Hannity said.

The image used for the broadcast was credited to the meme social media account @what.i.meme.to.say. The account didn't immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment on Twitter or Instagram.

Reinhart approved the warrant that allowed the FBI to search Trump's Mar-a-Lago property on Monday.

The judge has reportedly received violent and antisemitic threats by far-right extremists since signing off on the warrant.

In a tweet on Friday Kilmeade addressed the use of the doctored photo in Thursday night's segment and said he was ""showing a meme in jest.""

""Last night while subbing for Tucker Carlson we showed you an image of Judge Bruce Reinhart w/ Ghislaine Maxwell that was sourced on screen to a meme pulled from Twitter & wasn't real"" Kilmeade wrote. ""This depiction never took place & we wanted to make clear that we were showing a meme in jest.""

Werden1

Assistant Attorney General (“AAG”) in charge of the Antitrust Division Jonathan Kanter vowed that “if the facts and the law and a careful analysis of Department policies guiding our use of prosecutorial discretion warrant a criminal Section 2 charge the Division will not hesitate to enforce the law.”2 This article reviews history precedent and other considerations to shed light on what AAG Kanter might do and it ponders the question: What would be the point?

I. SHERMAN ACT CRIMES

Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act created four misdemeanors. Section 1 created just one — to contract combine or conspire in restraint of trade3 while Section 2 created three — to monopolize to attempt to monopolize and to conspire to monopolize.4 Consistent with the misdemeanor designation the crimes originally carried the maximum prison sentence of one year.

From 1890 to 1955 Sherman Act prosecutions were common but prison sentences were reserved for exceptional cases5 and the maximum fine was just $5000. From 1955 to 1974 the maximum fine was $50000. And in 1974 the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (“APPA”) increased the maximum fine for an individual to $100000 and the maximum fine for a corporation to $1 million. Critically the APPA also made Sherman Act violations felonies.6

The felony provisions of the APPA were a last minute addition long after the legislative hearings. On October 8 1974 President Gerald Ford revealed his plan to Whip Inflation Now.7 The plan included higher antitrust fines and a vow to “zero in on more effective enforcement against price fixing and bid rigging.”8 The President mentioned neither jailing offenders nor enforcement of Section 2. The October 11 House report on the APPA noted the President’s support for higher fines.9

Kauper the AAG in charge of the Antitrust Division then publicly stated that the Administration would propose making antitrust violations felonies.10 The Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Peter Rodino encouraged the proposal11 and it was made official on November 8.12 Chairman Rodino inserted the felony provision in the House bill on November 19 and the House immediately passed it. The Senate followed.

The Antitrust Division has actively and successfully prosecuted hard-core cartels as felonies racking up approximately 2000 prosecutions.13 The Division however appears never to have undertaken a felony Section 2 prosecution.14

Judges remained reluctant to incarcerate ordinary antitrust offenders after the APPA made them felons.15 Of the many things the Antitrust Division did to enhance cartel deterrence the most consequential might have been persuading the United States Sentencing Commission that cartel offenses merited substantial prison sentences and that fines should be tied to volume of commerce rather than actual impact.16

II. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES

The Sherman Act is somewhat problematic as a criminal law. The Supreme Court addressed its lack of specificity in the 1913 case of Nash v. United States17 which involved concerted exclusionary conduct criminally charged under both Section 1 and Section 2. The Court observed that a criminal law requires “some definiteness and certainty.”18 But the Court rejected the contention that the rule of reason under which legality turns on competitive impact lacked the requisite definiteness explaining that common law sometimes criminalized conduct on the basis of consequences that were neither intended nor foreseen.19

A year after the Nash decision the Supreme Court first declared a law void for vagueness.20 That law was Kentucky’s antitrust law which resembled Section 1 of the Sherman Act except for the additional proviso that conduct was prohibited only if it caused prices to depart from “real value.”21 International Harvester incurred multiple convictions as a result of the 1902 merger creating the company while Kentucky tobacco farmers were allowed to cooperate under the proviso’s protection.22 The Supreme Court struck down the law because determining “real value” was “a problem that no human ingenuity could solve.”23 Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes contrasted the Sherman Act where “a great body of precedents on the civil side coupled with familiar practice make it comparatively easy for common sense to keep to what is safe.”24

The Supreme Court struck down Colorado’s criminal antitrust law in 1927.25 Colorado had a Section 1–like prohibition but carved out conduct necessary to make a reasonable profit and the Supreme Court agreed with the district court that enforcement of the law violated the Due Process Clause due to the vagueness of the carve out.26 Chief Justice William Howard Taft further asserted that under the Sherman Act “the common law precedents as to what constituted an undue restraint of trade were quite specific enough to advise one engaged in interstate trade and commerce what he could and could not do under the statute.”27

In the foregoing quotations Taft and Holmes were describing only Section 1. The common law had been very tolerant of exclusionary conduct28 and Sherman Act precedent did not make clear what conduct was safe. In an important case decided the term before the Colorado case the Court explained that it had upheld criminal laws employing “words or phrases having a technical or other special meaning well enough known to enable those within their reach to correctly apply them or a well-settled common law meaning.”29 That too described Section 1 but to “monopolize” had no special meaning when the Sherman Act was written.30

Recent cases are instructive as to how the Sherman Act would be viewed today. In 2015 the Supreme Court struck down a law increasing the prison terms of defendants with three prior convictions for “violent felonies” and the Court rejected the notion that “a vague provision is constitutional” if “there is some conduct that clearly falls within the provision’s grasp.”31

In 2018 the Court struck down a similar provision in immigration law.32 Writing for the Court Justice Elena Kagan explained:

The prohibition of vagueness in criminal statutes . . . is an essential of due process required by both ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law. The void-for-vagueness doctrine as we have called it guarantees that ordinary people have fair notice of the conduct a statute proscribes. And the doctrine guards against arbitrary or discriminatory law enforcement by insisting that a statute provide standards to govern the actions of police officers prosecutors juries and judges. In that sense the doctrine is a corollary of the separation of powers—requiring that Congress rather than the executive or judicial branch define what conduct is sanctionable and what is not.33

In 2019 the Court struck down a provision of the Hobbs Act enhancing the sentence for a “crime of violence” even though the Act provided a useful definition of the term.34 Writing for the Court Justice Neil Gorsuch explained:

Our doctrine prohibiting the enforcement of vague laws rests on the twin constitutional pillars of due process and separation of powers. Vague laws contravene the first essential of due process of law that statutes must give people of common intelligence fair notice of what the law demands of them. Vague laws also undermine the Constitution’s separation of powers and the democratic self-governance it aims to protect. Only the people’s elected representatives in the legislature are authorized to make an act a crime. Vague statutes threaten to hand responsibility for defining crimes to relatively unaccountable police prosecutors and judges eroding the people’s ability to oversee the creation of the laws they are expected to abide.35

Since Sherman Act violations were made felonies the Department of Justice generally has confined felony antitrust prosecutions to hard-core cartel activity.36 That practice minimized the risk of successful constitutional challenges37 because “[o]bjections to vagueness under the Due Process Clause rest on the lack of notice and hence may be overcome in any specific case where reasonable persons would know that their conduct is at risk.”38 Hard-core cartel activity was very clearly held to be unlawful per se in the 1940 decision United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.39 and that decision asserted that the per se rule had been in effect for more than forty years.40

Confining criminal Sherman Act enforcement to conduct that clearly is subject to the per se rule addresses the vagueness problem41 but it highlights a separation-of-powers issue. Criminalizing conduct is an exercise of legislative power and the Constitution vests all legislative power in the Congress.42 Congress however neither crafted the per se rule nor made the policy judgment to confine prosecution to conduct within the per se rule. The present conservative majority on the Supreme Court might view this as impermissible delegation.

The Supreme Court has not struck down a law for impermissible delegation since 1935 but it considered doing so in a 2019 case concerning the constitutionality of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.43 No opinion commanded allegiance from a majority of the eight-member court. Writing for the four liberals voting to uphold the Act Justice Kagan explained that “a nondelegation inquiry always begins (and often almost ends) with statutory interpretation. The constitutional question is whether Congress has supplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee’s use of discretion.”44 Justice Gorsuch joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas took issue with the “intelligible principle” approach to the extent that it allowed the Executive Branch to “make the policy judgments.”45

Any person charged with a felony in a typical Section 2 case would have a solid due process argument based on the lack of fair notice. The Supreme Court has not declared any exclusionary conduct to be unlawful per se.46 Indeed the Court has not articulated a consistent principle for separating legitimate competition from illegitimate exclusion. And of course the Department of Justice has no history of felony prosecutions under Section 2.

The argument that fair notice was not provided would lose much of its power if the alleged conduct involved violence. When AAG Charles F. Rule explained in detail the Antitrust Division’s criminal enforcement policy in 1988 he cited conduct involving violence or the threat of violence as the only possible exception to the general rule that criminal enforcement of the Sherman Act is confined to hard-core cartel activity.47 Historical examples of such cases are discussed in the next section.

III. CHARGING BOTH SECTION 1 AND SECTION 2 VIOLATIONS

AAG Kanter might be looking for a case presenting concerted conduct that can be charged under both Section 1 and Section 2 and history offers several examples. One is the Nash case mentioned above.48up> The defendants were convicted under both Section 1 and Section 2 for concerted exclusionary conduct. The court did not impose two separate sentences nor was any defendant sentenced to more the statutory maximum for a single count.49 The trial court likely believed that the same conspiracy had been charged under both Section 1 and Section 2.

In United States v. MacAndrews & Forbes Co. a few years earlier the defendants had been separately sentenced on two Sherman Act counts and in total each was fined more than the statutory maximum.50 The trial court held that the Section 1 and Section 2 offenses were distinct because the Section 1 offense was the defendants’ agreement while the Section 2 violation was their overt acts.51 An oft-stated principle is that a “substantive crime and a conspiracy to commit that crime are not the ‘same offence’ for double jeopardy purposes.”52 This principle applies even though the overt acts further the unlawful agreement.

All four Section 1 and 2 crimes were charged in a few cases. In 1933 the Antitrust Division secured Sherman Act indictments in five racketeering cases alleging cartels enforced through violence. In two cases involving furs those charged included Louis “Lepke” Buchalter and Jacob “Gurrah” Shapiro the only subjects of FBI wanted posters for antitrust violations.

Lepke was convicted on all counts in both cases but successfully appealed his convictions. He then entered into plea bargains under which he was sentenced in each case to two concurrent one-year prison terms one for violating Section 1 and one for violating Section 2. As a practical matter the most notorious criminal ever convicted under Section 2 did not serve a single day as a result. But Lekpe was convicted of other crimes and he was executed in 1944 for a murder committed shortly before his first antitrust trial.

Gurrah was convicted on all counts in both cases and the convictions withstood appellate review. In the first case he was sentenced to three concurrent one-year terms for the Section 2 violations as well as one year for the Section 1 violation. The Section 1 and Section 2 sentences ran consecutively which he argued violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. But the Second Circuit held that the Section 1 conspiracy was distinct from the Section 2 conspiracy.53

In the second case Gurrah’s sentence was the same except that the Section 2 sentences for monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize also ran consecutively. He argued on appeal that the consecutive Section 2 sentences violated the Double Jeopardy Clause54up> but the court invoked the principle that a substantive crime and a conspiracy to commit that crime are not the same offence for double jeopardy purposes.

American Tobacco Co. v. United States (1946)55 was similar to the racketeering cases in that the three big tobacco companies and twelve of their executives were convicted of all four crimes under Section 1 and Section 2. The Supreme Court held that “§§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act require proof of conspiracies which are reciprocally distinguishable from and independent of each other although the objects of the conspiracies may partially overlap.”56

The Court did not explain how this requirement was satisfied most likely because the sole question presented was whether the monopolization offense required actual exclusion of competitors. But the Supreme Court and appellate opinions in American Tobacco clearly described distinct Section 1 and Section 2 conspiracies. The evidence showed that the defendants targeted the upstart ten-cent brands57 rigged bids in purchasing leaf tobacco58 and controlled retail prices.59

In American Tobacco the Court cited Blockburger v. United States holding that: “The applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.”60 Applying this rule the Court has held for example that a man who stole a car then drove it could not be prosecuted for both auto theft and joyriding.61

The Blockburger test permits adding a Section 2 conspiracy count to a cartel indictment if the indictment alleges two distinct conspiracies with two distinct objects and of course the object of the Section 2 conspiracy must be exclusion. Adding a Section 2 monopolization or attempt to monopolize count is permissible with overt acts of exclusionary conduct.62 A court is unlikely to entertain a novel and expansive reading of Section 2 because the “rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them.”63

If a person were convicted of violating both Section 1 and Section 2 the issue of sentence would remain. All of the cases discussed above were concluded before the creation of the United States Sentencing Commission. Section 3D1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines now provides that “[a]ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together.”64 Thus adding a Section 2 conviction to a Section 1 conviction would enhance the Guidelines sentence only if the conduct charged under Section 2 was shown to produce harm distinct from that flowing from the conduct charged under Section 1.65

IV. CONCLUSION

AAG Kanter should expect an immediate constitutional challenge on due process and separation of powers grounds if he indicts someone in a typical Section 2 case. And he should expect things to go badly. A decision to prosecute in an otherwise insignificant case could turn it into the most consequential case in antitrust history.

And what could be accomplished if a Section 2 prosecution were to go off without a hitch? While a civil Section 2 case opens the door to the full panoply of equitable remedies including corporate restructuring a criminal case is just about punishment. But no judge would imprison a businessperson for non-violent exclusionary conduct and any fine would be trivial compared to those routine in the EU. So what would be the point?

Mfrs.’ Ass’n of Relocatable Bldg. Indus. 462 F.2d 49 52 (9th Cir. 1972). The jury decides the two questions of fact: whether a defendant entered into an agreement and whether it was within the scope of the per se rule. The per se rule holds that price fixing bid rigging and market allocation are inherently unreasonable because they necessarily stifle competition. The per se rule is a special case of the rule of reason under which only competition matters. See Gregory J. Werden Antitrust’s Rule of Reason: Only Competition Matters 79 ANTITRUST L.J. 713 (2014).

An image of the judge was tacked onto an old photo of Jeffrey Epstein getting a foot rub by Ghislaine Maxwell.

Fox News aired a digitally altered photo that replaced an old image of Jeffrey Epstein getting a foot rub from Ghislaine Maxwell with the body and face of the federal judge who signed off on the warrant allowing FBI agents to search former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago.

The altered photo — originally an image of the late convicted sex offender Epstein cozying up to convicted sex trafficker Maxwell on a private jet — was broadcast during ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Thursday while Fox News' Brian Kilmeade was serving as guest host.

""Also a picture of Bruce Reinhart"" Kilmeade said during the segment as the fake image showing Reinhart — a magistrate judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida — was shown to viewers.

In the photo Reinhart can be seen with a box of Golden Oreos and a bottle of Early Times whiskey in his right hand. Epstein's upper body in the image was replaced with Reinhart's.

""This is the judge in charge of the of the of the um as you know of the warrant and we'll see if he's going to release it next — he likes Oreos and whiskey"" Kilmeade said during the broadcast.

During the broadcast Kilmeade asked Fox News' Sean Hannity whether he can ""relate to that"" prompting Hannity himself to call out the photo for being altered.

""I think that's actually a picture of Jeffrey Epstein with somebody putting [Reinhart's] head on there"" Hannity told Kilmeade adding ""I'm guessing I don't know.""

Kilmeade responded ""It might be his plane. Who knows?""

""I'll let you determine that in the morning. We'll be watching"" a chuckling Hannity said.

The image used for the broadcast was credited to the meme social media account @what.i.meme.to.say. The account didn't immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment on Twitter or Instagram.

Reinhart approved the warrant that allowed the FBI to search Trump's Mar-a-Lago property on Monday.

The judge has reportedly received violent and antisemitic threats by far-right extremists since signing off on the warrant.

In a tweet on Friday Kilmeade addressed the use of the doctored photo in Thursday night's segment and said he was ""showing a meme in jest.""

""Last night while subbing for Tucker Carlson we showed you an image of Judge Bruce Reinhart w/ Ghislaine Maxwell that was sourced on screen to a meme pulled from Twitter & wasn't real"" Kilmeade wrote. ""This depiction never took place & we wanted to make clear that we were showing a meme in jest.""

THESE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE CHEAPER TO OWN THAN GAS ONES NOW

Mazda's bottom line was most directly harmed by lockdowns in Shanghai where computer chips for their vehicles are assembled.

Disruption in chip supplies following the coronavirus pandemic hampered production of goods from smartphones to autos and highlighted the world's reliance on Taiwanese chips and Chinese factories that assemble most electronic devices.

Vanguard’s active mutual funds had their bloodiest first half ever data indicates even as its passive products enjoyed inflows.

Investors pulled $54.3bn from the firm’s 71 active mutual funds during the first six months of 2022 the most of any fund complex according to Morningstar Direct and the worst it has ever recorded on its database which goes back to 1993. Vanguard active mutual funds had $1.2tn in assets at the end of June a huge increase on the $77bn such vehicles held in 1993.

Around half of the manager’s first-half outflows came out of five mutual funds the database shows including from the $46bn International Bond Index Fund which shed $24.1bn and the $73.4bn Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt Fund which leaked $9.93bn.

Vanguard’s passive mutual funds which had $3.2tn in assets as of June 30 garnered $3.1bn in net inflows during the first half according to Morningstar Direct and its $1.8tn ETF line added $103.2bn during the period.

This article was previously published by Ignites a title owned by the FT Group.

Across all its US products — which include ETFs mutual funds collective investment trusts and stable value funds — the firm pulled in $77.1bn in net inflows during the first half according to data provided by the company.

“Vanguard has some of the biggest active funds out there so you would expect that just on a plain dollar basis they would have some of the biggest outflows” said Daniel Wiener chair of Adviser Investments and editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors.

Only American Funds and Fidelity have more assets in active mutual funds according to Morningstar.

Another factor that may have played a role in the net outflows from Vanguard’s active funds is the fact that there is a limited opportunity for new flows to come in said Alec Lucas a strategist on Morningstar’s manager research team. Vanguard’s $64bn Primecap Funds for example has been largely closed off to new investors. “The most attractive options in this suite of actively managed funds have limited to no availability for new flows” Lucas said.

A Vanguard spokesperson declined to comment.

Industry-wide active mutual funds recorded redemptions of $454.2bn during the first half Morningstar data shows. Only five of the 50 largest providers of actively managed mutual funds recorded net inflows during the first half according to a recent Ignites analysis.

Together the five asset managers which suffered the greatest outflows in descending order — Vanguard Fidelity Pimco Franklin Templeton and T Rowe Price — recorded $164.6bn in net redemptions during the six-month period according to Morningstar.

Fidelity which had $1.2tn in active mutual funds at the end of June recorded $35.5bn in net outflows from its active funds during the first half Morningstar’s data shows. Nearly all of those flows $31.3bn came out of the Boston-based firm’s US equity funds which account for more than 51 per cent of its total net assets in active mutual funds.

“Only actively managed funds offer investors the opportunity to outperform the market over time while most index funds underperform the market net of fees” a Fidelity spokesperson said. “We also believe that investors want access to a diverse set of investment styles capabilities and low-cost investment vehicles.”

Fidelity’s passive mutual funds which had $876bn in assets as of June 30 added $50.5bn in net inflows during the first half according to Morningstar. Its $28.8bn ETF line meanwhile added $1.2bn.

T. Rowe Price had $22.7bn in net outflows from its active mutual funds in the first half but added $131mn to its suite of ETFs which are actively managed strategies. The firm reported $7bn in assets shifting to from mutual funds to other vehicles such as collective investment trusts during the period.

I can safely say it’s a stonking fitness watch one of the best Garmin watches to date. The Enduro 2 is packed to the gills with every feature you could ever want in an outdoor watch.

Topographical maps? Check. Ultrafit race-friendly strap? Check. Titanium casing and solar-charging Sapphire glass lens? Check. Health snapshot feature to serve up all your vital data in one place? Check. It can even calculate the best way to return to the starting point of your hike run or ride or signal your contacts in case of an emergency. When it comes to adventuring this watch is a better companion than Bear Grylls.

However the watch I’m using is a testing unit a loaner from Garmin provided for review purposes. Eventually I’ll be done with my review and have to return it to Garmin Towers. And if I had to go out and buy myself a new fitness watch once the testing period is over this is not the watch I’d choose to buy.

(Image credit: Garmin)

For one thing it costs $1099 / £929.99 / AU$1700 which is a lot of cash for most people to splash on a performance tool. It’s almost the most expensive watch in Garmin’s lineup right now. Which leads nicely to my second point: if you’re going to invest in a high-performance sports watch you should be a high-performance athlete.

Like a neon Bugatti the Enduro 2 isn’t happy when just crawling through traffic in the city: it’s begging to shift into high gear and be really tested on the open road. If you’re not taking it out enough you’ll have paid an enormous amount for a status symbol when for practical purposes a hatchback might do.

Fully testing this watch is going to be a challenge. Even though I’m a keen runner I’m a casual enthusiast clocking up around 20km in an average week between gym sessions – although that will increase soon when I begin marathon training. When I read the spec sheet my first thought was “how on earth am I going to run enough to put this damn thing through its paces?”

If you’re not a serious outdoor enthusiast ultra-runner dedicated cyclist or regular triathlete the Enduro 2 is probably too much watch for you. You’ll be wasting your hard-earned cash on something you’ll never get the most out of. To get the most bang for your buck here’s a selection of smart fitness products more suited for the average athlete's needs:

1. Fitbit Inspire 2

The best cheap fitness tracker is a great buy for someone who is either just beginning their health and fitness journey or doesn’t do a lot of endurance exercise. If you’re just looking for a simple device to help you stay a little healthier track your heart rate and calories burned on a park run and log your gym and yoga sessions the Fitbit Inspire 2 is all you need.

The Inspire 2 comes with a year of Fitbit’s Premium service included. This provides follow-along workouts advanced sleep profiles with suggestions to improve your Sleep Score and other helpful advice and metrics that give a better understanding of your health. The band will nudge you if you’ve been sitting too long and guided breathing exercises and meditations can help you unwind after a stressful day.

2. Apple Watch 7

The Apple Watch 7 is an excellent all-rounder and the natural choice for existing iPhone users. Whether you’re a keen runner hiker yogi or HIIT workout fan “closing the rings” on your Apple Watch to signify that you’ve fit enough movement into your day is a point of pride for many users.

A step up from simple trackers like the Inspire 2 the Apple Watch has recently been revamped with new sleep activity and running metrics in watchOS 9. It’s a sophisticated health improvement tool but it’s still for generalists and everyday exercisers rather than single-discipline athletes.

3. Polar Pacer Pro

The other watch I’m testing at the moment the Polar Pacer Pro is a specialist watch for runners although it has plenty of other activity profile options. However as a tool for those hitting the road it’s got none of the lifestyle aspects of the Apple Watch which means no third-party apps no pretty AMOLED butter-smooth touchscreen no on-wrist video and no menstrual health tracking.

Fortunately it excels in its specialist area with running power calculated just from your wrist without needing a heart rate monitor like Garmin does. Polar’s running metrics are always amazing with heart rate training zones and speed calculated alongside the cadence of your run your overall cardio load and detailed graphs of minute-by-minute performance. Want detailed metrics without the overload of a four-figure fitness watch? This is the one for you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vYmlrZXJ1bW9yLmNvbS90aGUtYmVzdC1ncHMtd2F0Y2hlcy1mb3ItY3ljbGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best GPS Watches for Cycling,"by Jordan Villela with Molly Hurford

If you like your data in one place because you run/swim/hike/any other sport in addition to biking you might prefer a GPS watch rather than a dedicated cycling computer. And compared to a few years ago wearables are getting much better at tracking data actually providing navigation and syncing to all your bike devices like power meters. At the time of writing Apple hadn’t yet released their new Apple Watch Ultra so we’ll have to wait to see how that compares to some of these established watches.

If you like to keep everything in one place the world of fitness wearables is quickly catching up and in some cases surpassing cycling head units. Most brands that used to deal solely in bike computers are adding watches to their offerings. These super lightweights hardly noticeable wrist computers are a great way of tracking data without the mess of multiple devices and platforms. Here we’re sharing a few of our favorites.

It’s not cheap but for a watch that looks great for daily use has killer battery life and can guide you on your ride while also providing heart rate data from your wrist and connecting to your power meter it’s hard to top the Polar Grit X. And it’s constantly improving: One of the best features we’ve seen in some of the latest connected electronic devices like Polar’s Grit X smartwatch is the ability for over-the-air updates. Who doesn’t love extra features for free! With smart adaptable hardware Polar has repeatedly been able to develop new capabilities with each new generation of smart devices then figure out how to bring much of that new functionality back to existing users via firmware updates.

Buyer’s Guide for Cycling GPS Watches

Picking a GPS watch can be challenging. You need to purchase something that gives you the data you require and allows you to grow. The newest units from Garmin Wahoo and others offer more than time and distance for a ride. These new metrics allow for personal competition as well as some additional ways to keep you engaged during your next ride.

Understand the limitations: Here’s the thing. Watches are great for multisport athletes but like any product that claims to do it all it might technically do everything but maybe not as well as the specific tool for the job would. You might have a corkscrew on your Swiss Army Knife but would you use it instead of a proper corkscrew if you had the choice? Similarly if you could choose between a watch with GPS navigation versus a cycling computer the cycling computer is going to win every time simply because of the size and shape of the screen. Even the smaller cycling GPS computer screens are 150% bigger than a typical GPS watch.

Navigation and GPS: If you are a rider that likes to explore new trails and travel for adventure having navigation and an accurate GPS and can map correctly is a huge advantage—and one that watches are still trying to perfect. Thanks to Trailforks Strava and other mapping softwares more and more trails and gravel roads are accurately mapped and are downloadable to these units for easy turn-by-turn directions. But be careful with this if you’re looking at watches that aren’t on this list—there are many multi-sport watches with great GPS but don’t provide any actual mapping or navigation.

Mounting options: Some watches actually come with a handlebar mount so you can use the watch exactly like a cycling computer. And some don’t come stock with the mount but offer it as an add on—we tend to prefer that especially when using the watch for navigation but plenty of people will just wear the watch and glance at it as needed. (When it’s on your wrist though it is much harder to read so will mostly be for data collection rather than in-ride intel.)

BTE ANT+ WiFi: While many smartwatches are great with GPS some will struggle to sync to your power meter. Make sure your watch has the connectivities that you need.

Fit and comfort: For smaller wristed people some of these watches can be uncomfortably large. Once you do get the watch make sure it feels comfortable before committing to it. Most brands accept returns especially if the watch is unused. You can also check at your local bike shop to see if you can try one on before purchasing.

How the screen displays power and heart rate: If you’re a cross country racer or someone who trains with power – you’re in luck. Most units display power and heart rate. Something that separates them is how they can display the power readings (show Garmin wahoo stages volume). When you’re dodging trees and trying to hold your line the last thing you want to do is have to look for your power on the screen. Some of the units have creative ways of displaying power and heart rate to give the rider a quick snapshot of their effort via lights or a color scale so you can make sure you’re in the correct zone and roll on.

Extras: Some smartwatches are actually smart enough to act similar to an Apple Watch and will allow you to control your phone change music in ride and make calls. Some act as all-day fitness trackers or measure HRV. You may not want or need these features so if you’re on a tight budget make sure you’re not paying a premium for extras you won’t use.

Smart notifications: Most GPS watches now are almost always ‘smart’ so you’ll get notifications from your phone. Remember though you don’t need to leave them turned on. Who really wants to see the text from your boss while you’re on your lunch ride?

Other sport options: If you’re looking for a watch for cycling it’s almost always because you’re a multisport athlete. So make sure that the watch you choose has the ability to track all of your sports. Most do have options for the obvious sports like running swimming (open water and pool laps) and hiking but what about paddling cross country skiing etc.?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FkZ2V0c2FuZHdlYXJhYmxlcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xMy9nYXJtaW4tcmVjb3ZlcnktdGltZS1pbXByb3ZlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Improved Recovery Time calculation explained,"5 min read

Garmin has recently improved its Recovery Time feature. Now it takes even more factors into account. Here’s everything you need to know about this useful metric and how it arrives at its calculations.

The importance of scheduling in rest days

Whether you are a recreational or serious athlete it is important not to overtrain. Not only can it lead to injury but it can be counter-productive in terms of performance. And let’s face it you don’t want to get the dreaded Garmin “Unproductive Training Status” message and reduction in Vo2Max.

Training with high intensity breaks the body down and causes a tiny amount of tissue damage. So time is needed in order to rebuild and fix this damage. Rest gives your body a chance to adapt in order to get stronger and more resilient. This is how muscles and stamina are formed and is what makes your next performance possible.

Essential reading: Top fitness trackers and health gadgets

The other benefit of rest is that it reinvigorates your spirit so that you actually want to keep on training. Which is also very important as it helps to avoid staleness and apathy during workouts. In essence scheduling in enough recovery time helps strengthen the body and sharpen focus. It helps to avoid overtraining fatique and lack of motivation.

Garmin Recovery Time metric eliminates the guesswork

Okay we all agree that getting adequate rest is just as important as the volume of training you put in. But how much rest time is actually needeed? How long is enough? This is where Garmin Recovery Time calculations step in.

The metric has been around for a few years now on many Garmin GPS watches. Post workout it provides a count-down for the amount of time you should rest before doing another hard workout.

The value ranges from zero to a maximum of four days. When your timer hits zero it means you are fully ready to do another workout of the same or greater intensity (Training Effect: 3.0+).

On older watches the calculations are simplified. They take into account the following factors:

The training effect of your most recent workout – this is the most important factor. Garmin says it is measured “in terms of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) based training load”. The strain also depends on your recent workout history. However Recovery Times are not simply added together. Instead they are re-evaluated by the Garmin algorithm.

– this is the most important factor. Garmin says it is measured “in terms of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) based training load”. The strain also depends on your recent workout history. However Recovery Times are not simply added together. Instead they are re-evaluated by the Garmin algorithm. Your current fitness level – behind the scenes adjustments are made that take into account your VO2 max fitness level and your acute (7-day) to chronic (28-day) training load ratio.

Something to keep in mind – you can still train even if your Recovery Time is not down to zero. But in this case it is best to keep the workouts light. You should definitely not attempt that personal best if your remaining Recovery Time is high.

Also if you have a new Garmin watch it may take a while before the results are accurate. This is because the device needs time to learn your overall fitness level. So it is best to put in several exercise days before being religious about following Recovery Time recommendations.

Newer watches have Improved Recovery Time

Newer watches feature a better recovery time algorithm. Garmin refers to this as Improved Recovery Time. Now you don’t get a simple countdown. You actually have the ability to shorten the initial recovery time calculation with day-to-day lifestyle changes.

These are the additional factors that are taken into account:

Stress levels

Quality of sleep

Additional training intensity

Daily activity levels

So get enough quality kip time keep the stress to a minimum engage in light daily activities and you might see your Recovery Time shrink. Sleep is probably the most important factor as this is when your body does most of its repair work. Miss out on a good night of sleep and your Recovery Time will increase.

It is no wonder Elite athletes are encouraged to get at least nine hours of quality kip time. And to treat it with just as much importance as training.

This is the full list of devices with the improved Recovery Time feature:

D2 Mach

Descent Mk2 Series

Enduro Series

Epix (Gen 2) Series

Fenix 6 & 7 Series

Forerunner 55 245 Series 745 945 Series 955 Series

Instinct 2 Series

MARQ Collection

Quatix 6 Series

The next step up from the Recovery Time feature is something Garmin calls Training Readiness. This is a more encompassing metic that assesses your physical state overall.

It uses heart rate variability (HRV) trends which measure the overall condition of the nervous system and whether the sympathetic or parasympathetic system is dominant. The value ranges from zero to 100. The closer you are to 100 the better your Training Readiness.

At the time of writing Training Readiness is only available on the Garmin Forerunner 955. But it is already in Beta on Fenix 7 and Epix so should hit these and other Garmin watches in the next month or so.

Approaching engagement strategies as business strategies yield better results

Highly engaged organizations share common philosophies and practices

Creating a great workplace culture that has star employees who know how to win new customers isn't about making employees happy or content -- and organizations falter when they think it is.

It's true that enthusiastic and energetic employees feel better about their work and workplace. But engagement is not determined by an abstract feeling. Measuring workers' contentment or happiness levels as well as catering to their wants often fails to achieve the underlying goal of employee engagement: improved business outcomes.

Organizations have more success with engagement and improve business performance when they treat employees as stakeholders of their own future and the company's future. This means focusing on concrete performance management activities such as clarifying work expectations getting people what they need to do their work providing development and promoting positive coworker relationships.

The majority of the U.S. workforce (65%) is not engaged according to Gallup's State of the Global Workplace: 2022 Report. These employees are indifferent and neither like nor dislike their job. They represent a risk and that risk can tilt either way -- good or bad.

###Embeddable###

Many employees who are not engaged want a reason to be inspired. They are the ""show me"" group that needs an extra push to perform at their best. While positive feelings such as happiness are usually byproducts of engagement they shouldn't be confused with the primary outcomes. Rather the primary emphasis should be on elements that engage workers and drive results such as clarity of expectations the opportunity to do what they do best development and opinions counting.

Employee Engagement Strategies Are Good for Business

Approaching engagement as a business strategy yields clear and better results. Gallup recently conducted the 10th version of our meta-analysis (a study of studies) to determine the relationship of engagement -- as measured by Gallup's employee engagement survey -- to business-/work-unit profitability productivity employee retention and customer perception.

Despite massive changes in the economy and technology the results of the most recent meta-analysis are consistent with the results of each previous version. Simply put engaged employees produce better business outcomes than other employees do -- across industries company sizes and nationalities and in good economic times and bad.

Business or work units that score in the top quartile of their organization in employee engagement more than double their odds of success (based on a composite of financial customer retention safety quality shrinkage and absenteeism metrics) when compared with those in the bottom quartile. Those at the 99th percentile have nearly five times the success rate of those at the first percentile.

When compared with business units in the bottom quartile of engagement those in the top quartile realize improvements in the following areas among others:

Showing up and staying: Engaged employees make it a point to show up to work and do more work -- highly engaged business units realize an 81% difference in absenteeism and a 14% difference in productivity. Engaged workers also are more likely to stay with their employers. In high-turnover organizations highly engaged business units achieve an 18% difference in turnover. In low-turnover organizations the gains are even more dramatic: Highly engaged business units achieve a 43% difference in turnover. High-turnover organizations are those with more than 40% annualized turnover and low-turnover organizations are those with 40% or lower annualized turnover.

Customer outcomes: Employees who are engaged consistently show up to work and have a greater commitment to quality and safety. Understandably these employees also help their organizations improve customer relationships and obtain impressive organic growth. Highly engaged business units achieve a 10% difference in customer ratings and an 18% difference in sales.

Profit: The previous outcomes collide to bring organizations increased profitability. Engaged employees are more present and productive; they are more attuned to the needs of customers; and they are more observant of processes standards and systems. When taken together the behaviors of highly engaged business units result in a 23% difference in profitability.

Creating the Right Organizational Culture Is Possible

Employee engagement has long been a concern in the U.S. workforce but -- perhaps now more than ever -- it represents a vital component of employee attraction and retention. For the modern workforce an engaging work environment is a fundamental expectation a baseline requirement. Many employees refuse to settle for an organization that does not strategically prioritize engagement. For leaders this means a culture of engagement is no longer an option -- it is an urgent need.

Creating a culture of engagement requires more than completing an annual employee survey and then leaving managers on their own hoping they will learn something from the survey results that will change the way they manage. It requires an organization to take a close look at how critical engagement elements align with their performance development and human capital strategies.

Engaging employees takes work and commitment but it is not impossible. Just about one-third of the overall U.S. workforce is engaged. And many organizations come to Gallup with even lower percentages of engaged employees -- the median engagement level among our first-year clients is 41%.

But as they shift their approach these organizations begin to realize improvements in performance. The engagement level among recent Gallup clients is 48% and it is even higher among clients with the highest levels of engagement -- the winners of the Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award. In these organizations an average of 70% of employees are engaged and there are 14 engaged employees for every actively disengaged employee -- a ratio that is 6.6 times the national average.

Highly engaged organizations share common philosophies and practices. Among other things:

They know creating a culture of engagement starts at the top.

Their leaders are aligned in prioritizing engagement as a competitive strategic point of differentiation.

They communicate openly and consistently.

They place the utmost importance on using the right metrics and on hiring and developing great managers.

Highly engaged organizations also hold their managers accountable -- not just for their team's measured engagement level but also for how it relates to their team's overall performance. They ensure that managers are engaging employees from the first minute of their first day at work.

These organizations have well-defined and comprehensive development programs for leaders and managers and they focus on the development of individuals and teams. Employee engagement is a fundamental consideration in their people strategy not an annual ""check-the-box"" activity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9hcy1jb21wYW5pZXMtZmlnaHQtdG8tcmV0YWluLXRhbGVudC1lbXBsb3llZS1iZW5lZml0cy1zdGFydHVwcy1taWdodC1lc2NhcGUtY29zdC1jdXRzL9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9hcy1jb21wYW5pZXMtZmlnaHQtdG8tcmV0YWluLXRhbGVudC1lbXBsb3llZS1iZW5lZml0cy1zdGFydHVwcy1taWdodC1lc2NhcGUtY29zdC1jdXRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As companies fight to retain talent employee-benefits startups might escape cost cuts,"How will employee-benefits startups fare when their corporate customers start slashing costs as the market goes downhill? We’re going to find out if current trends continue.

There was a spike in the number of startups offering employee-benefits services through a B2B2C model last year as nearly every company focused on employee benefits amid the Great Resignation in an effort to retain and attract talent. These startups sell everything from paid care leave coordination and fertility services to discounted gym memberships to consumers through their employers.

But the freewheeling spending of 2021 is now over and some of these startups could find their offered services on the chopping block if market conditions continue to worsen.

If there is indeed a recession on the horizon many of these startups would be right to fear for their future growth but Brian Kropp chief of HR research at Gartner doesn’t think this downturn will mirror the last. Kropp told TechCrunch that even if the market enters a recession it won’t be similar to what we saw in 2008 because of the ongoing labor shortage.

“Even with some of the headlines about an increase in layoffs and economic uncertainty one of the things that is really interesting is that the labor market is really tight.” Kropp said. “We are still in an environment where hiring is really high all things considered.”

He added that a recent survey Gartner facilitated found that 40% of companies still planned to increase hiring this year less than a third are planning to cut back on hiring and the rest are looking to stick to their prior schedules.

Because the labor market is so tight Kropp said employers should focus on keeping their benefits if they can. He said that taking away a benefit has a much higher negative outcome on existing employees than the positives associated with adding one even if few people are using the benefit to begin with.

“The mistake that people make is assuming the only people getting value out of the benefits are the people using those benefits” he said. “A lot of the value of the benefit is that people know they could take advantage of it if they need to. For example it’s nice to know that my employer would provide long-term coverage if I have a significant disability but I hope to never use it.”

He said that companies that added mission-driven benefits should be especially careful. For example a wellness company slashing its gym reimbursement benefit would not come across well to the employees who joined due to value alignment.

“It becomes a real disconnect between your values and actions” he said. “What do you stand for? What do you believe in as a company? You need to make the decision on would you offer this benefit or not or take it away.”

It makes sense. Plus if a company already lost a significant amount of employees to the Great Resignation cutting a benefit may only add fuel to the fire. Kropp added that employers are better off pausing hiring or deleting open positions to save money in the long run.

It seems many companies understand this. Gympass a $2 billion startup that offers discount memberships to a variety of gyms as well as wellness offerings to consumers through their employers had its best quarter in its 10-year history in Q2 2022 Carolee Gearhart its chief revenue officer told TechCrunch.

“We just finished Q2. It was the biggest quarter we have ever had. It was close to 40% higher than Q1” Gearhart said. “We are only seeing continued acceleration amid this recognition that things have fundamentally changed and they aren’t going back.”

While Gearhart admitted that her company hasn’t been able to track how much its fitness-focused benefit helps retain talent she said 30% fewer Gympass users leave their companies than their counterparts who don’t utilize the benefit.

While many companies who sell to large corporations seem safe for the time being how long that will last seems dependent on which types of companies these employee-benefit startups are selling to.

David Frankel a partner at Founder Collective said that if things continue to get worse the health of a B2B2C company’s underlying customer base is critical. If you sell to a late-stage startup that was overvalued last year it might be focused more on saving costs now and your growth might be at greater risk than if you sell to a company like Amazon.

“Who are your customers?” Frankel asked. “Who are your customers and how strong are they?”

For now it seems that employee-benefits startups are safer than we might have guessed at least as long as they sold to the right companies last year and there are no big changes regarding the supply and demand balance in the labor market. Kropp said while companies that are in a position of desperation would shred their employee benefits it doesn’t look like we are there yet.

“They expect competition for talent to stay hot” Kropp said. “Only a third of companies in the competition for talent will decrease hiring.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbmFseXplLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4L2ludmVzdGluZy1pbi11bnN0cnVjdHVyZWQtZGF0YS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investing in the Explosive Growth of Unstructured Data,"Elon Musk suggested that today’s polarized societies can be brought together by finding a common interest.

(WSMV/Gray News) - A Nashville all-girls private school is welcoming transgender students.

Harpeth Hall School a private college-preparatory school for girls says anyone who identifies as female can apply to the school.

This week school officials shared a statement that “Harpeth Hall is a girls school” and “any student who identifies as a girl may apply to our school.”

“To be one of the first single-sex schools to take a stance on it you’re going to draw a lot of attention from that” Courtney Vick a 2008 graduate of Harpeth Hall said.

WSMV reports the school is taking a step to include transgender individuals which Vick supports.

“I do hope that some students who previously didn’t feel comfortable apply to Harpeth Hall now” Vick said.

A spokesperson with Harpeth Hall said the school’s application process would remain the same and it receives many applications each year for a limited number of openings.

Late last month the indigenous aircraft carrier-1 (IAC) `Vikrant’ was handed over to the Indian Navy by Cochin Shipyard. No dates have officially been announced however according to sources the carrier will be commissioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this month at a ceremony.

About IAc-1 Vikrant

IAC -1 `Vikrant’ has been designed in India and its construction which began in 2009 was not without risk. Originally scheduled for the end of the decade this date had to be pushed back owing to delays in the supply of specialised equipment bought from Russia and health precautions associated with the Covid-19 outbreak. Finally this ship could not set sail until August 2021.

The carrier’s delivery is ahead of its new schedule and does not have a dedicated air wing. So it has to share the MiG-29k fighter aircraft being flown from INS Vikramaditya. Till the air wing is firmed up the carrier will be put through familiarisation and improvements.

The choice lies between the French Rafale M from Dassault Aviation and F/A-18E Super Hornet. Financial Express Online has reported earlier that Rafale-M can be immediately delivered up to four numbers for training purposes till the production aircraft arrives. F/A-18E Super Hornet is the most successful carrier aircraft of the day. The Russian MiG-29k appears to have technical issues which is why the carrier wing has been delayed.

IAC-1 with a displacement of roughly 40000 tonnes a length of 262 metres and a width of 60 metres is in STOBAR configuration. This means it is equipped with a springboard to allow its carrier planes to take off. It can handle roughly thirty aircraft including 26 MiG-29K fighters this is due to four General Electric (GE) LM2500 + gas turbines that allow it to attain a maximum speed of 28 knots (18 knots at cruising speed). The Indian Navy has the option of equipping it with Russian Kamov Ka-31 Helicopters indigenous ALH `Dhruv’ and Sikorsky MH- 60 Romeo Seahawk anti-submarine helicopters from the US.

Indigenous content

Almost 75 percent of its components on IAC-1`Vikrant’ are of Indian origin. There are GE LM2500 gas turbines from the US some aviation-related equipment from Russia and some electronics from Israel.

Financial Express Online has reported earlier that in future the Indian Navy hopes to be able to have in the future a 65000-ton third aircraft carrier in CATOBAR configuration (with catapults and stoppers). Catapults which can be steam-powered or electromagnetic are that of French and American aircraft carriers and China has also allegedly launched one such carrier.

After the withdrawal of INS Viraat in 2017 the naval air capabilities of the Indian Navy relied only on the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya inducted to service in 2013 after being acquired from Russia (under the name “Admiral Gorshkov”) and refitted not without difficulty.

Expert View

Sharing his views with Financial Express Online Girish Linganna Aerospace & Defence Analyst says “There are reports regarding a third aircraft carrier. This three-carrier format which would allow India to have two ready-to-use carrier battle groups was decided upon as it appeared that maritime issues were constantly gaining in importance under the effect of the globalisation of trade and the rise of Chinese power. Until then New Delhi’s priority was the challenges posed at its borders by Pakistan and China. Hence it’s the so-called “double front” strategy. Therefore the decision to strengthen its naval capabilities marked a turning point.”

CATOBAR configuration

“The concern for the Indian Navy is that certain technologies necessary for a new generation aircraft carrier are currently lacking. Clearly it will need external support while the watchword in India is “Make in India”.

“A CATOBAR configuration also means that although India can build the hull it will depend on the Americans or the French for the catapult system. It requires a huge amount of power which can be fulfilled by only nuclear propulsion. India already has naval nuclear propulsion for INS Arihant class nuclear submarines and it could be modified for the aircraft carrier. China is building a conventionally powered CATOBAR carrier and we will see how it goes ”Girish Linganna explains.

The IAC-3

According to him “If built it is expected only by 2040. In the meantime Rafale-M and F/A-18E Super Hornet would have reached the end of life and India may start fielding its aircraft carrier-specific fighter the HAL Twin Engine Deck Based Fighter (TBDEF). We might also see India designing a 5th gen deck based fighter based on the TBDEF and Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) being designed for the Indian Air Force.”

Adding “A full-fledged CATOBAR carrier with aircraft can cost around USD20 billion and take a decade to construct. This makes New Delhi question whether it is worthwhile or spend the money on other important military purchase needs.”

In his opinion “Given the current tensions with China the third aircraft carrier is considered a vital necessity for the Indian Navy. But with the Indian government delaying its decision the chances of a favourable decision for the Navy may diminish.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Quality display

Excellent keyboard and touchpad

5G WWAN option

Attractive aesthetic Cons Performance lags Intel and Apple

Some flexing in the keyboard deck

Apple’s M1 is still sending shock waves through the industry. On one hand the ThinkPad X13s is the Windows equivalent.

Its ARM-based chip the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 offers some of the same benefits as the M1 or M2. It’s thin and light and the battery life is fantastic. For some that alone makes the ThinkPad X13s an attractive choice. But due to mediocre performance it’s yet another example of Windows on ARM laptops remaining a niche option for most people.

Price and configurations

As usual there’s a significant discrepancy on Lenovo’s website between the retail price and the “sale” price. Right now the entry-level ThinkPad X13s is $1301 (retail $2169) for a device with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 CPU 16GB of LPDDR4X RAM  a 512GB PCIe 4 SSD and touch display. That’s a pretty killer deal especially for that configuration.

At the high end is a $1571 (retail $2619) configuration with the Snapdragon processor 16GB of LPDDR4X RAM  a 1TB PCIe 4 SSD the non-touch display and 5G WWAN support. My review configuration was the entry-level model except for adding 5G WWAN capabilities which boosts the price to $1385.

I’m unaware of any other business-class Windows on ARM laptops to compare to the ThinkPad X13s. In the more conventional Intel space the Dell Latitude 7330 is a 13-inch laptop with the same business features and it’s more expensive than the ThinkPad at its sale prices.

The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 is another larger laptop at 14-inches that offers the same ThinkPad experience at slightly higher prices. Finally the HP Elite Dragonfly G3 offers an equally small and light form factor with 5G connectivity but it’s quite a bit more expensive.

Design

Look at the ThinkPad X13s from a distance and you’ll immediately recognize it as a member of the line. It’s all black (Thunder Black in fact) has the red dot on the “i” in the ThinkPad logo on the lid (albeit without an LED) and on the palm rest and the red TrackPoint nubbin stands out in the middle of the keyboard.

Up close though its edges are more rounded than the typical ThinkPad’s and there’s a prominent reverse notch at the top of the display for the webcam and IR camera. These small changes make the ThinkPad X13s stand out on its own. It’s certainly more striking than the Dell Latitude 7330 which is boring by comparison.

The ThinkPad X13s is constructed of two materials a magnesium-aluminum alloy in the lid and a glass fiber reinforced plastic in the chassis. I found the lid quite sturdy along with the bottom of the chassis but there was some slight flexing in the keyboard deck. It wasn’t egregious but it was enough to keep the ThinkPad a step behind laptops like the Dell XPS 13 Plus HP Spectre x360 13.5 and MacBook Air M1 in overall rigidity. The hinge is quite stiff requiring two hands to open the lid but it holds the display firmly in place.

Thanks to its lightweight materials the ThinkPad X13s is one of the lighter laptops we’ve tested at 2.35 pounds. It’s also thin at 0.53 inches. The HP Elite Dragonfly G3 is lighter at 2.2 pounds but thicker at 0.64 inches. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano is also lighter at 1.99 pounds but not as thin at 0.55 to 0.66 inches. So the ThinkPad X13s is among the lightest laptops you can buy and its chassis is thin and compact overall.

Ports and connectivity

Unsurprisingly the laptop’s connectivity is quite limited. There are two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports (no Thunderbolt 4 support due to the Qualcomm chipset) a 3.5mm audio jack and an optional NanoSIM slot for WWAN versions. Wireless connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.1 with 5G WWAN optional.

Performance

The ThinkPad X13s is built around Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 ARM processor an eight-core CPU with four Cortex-A78 cores running at 2.4GHz and four Cortex-X1 Prime cores running at 2.95GHz. It’s the fastest processor Qualcomm has yet made for the PC and promises increased performance over previous generations. Its primary direct competition is Apple’s silicon specifically the M1 and M2 CPUs that have provided class-leading performance in two iterations of the MacBook Air. Note that like Apple’s MacBook the ThinkPad X13s is fanless and so completely quiet.

The Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 is undoubtedly faster than its previous generation by 86% in the Geekbench 5 multi-core test and 55% in the single-core test. At the same time the Apple M1 is 59% faster than the ThinkPad X13s in single-core and 34% faster in multi-core and the M2 is 77% faster in single-core and 59% in multi-core. The lowest-end Intel 12th-core CPU we’ve tested the 15-watt 10-core/12-thread Core i5-1235U is 44% faster in single-core and 30% faster in multi-core. AMD’s Ryzen chips since the 5000 series have also been significantly faster.

Of course that’s just one synthetic benchmark and doesn’t tell the whole story. Unlike in previous Windows on ARM generations I was able to run our Handbrake test that encodes a 420MB video as H.265. Of course that doesn’t mean that Handbrake is optimized for ARM. And indeed the ThinkPad X13s took 505 seconds to complete the process compared to the MacBook Air M2 at 151 seconds and the Core i5-1235U at 134 seconds. I also managed to run the Cinebench R23 video-rendering benchmark and the ThinkPad X13s scored 593 in single-core and 2221 in multi-core. That compares to the MacBook Air M2 at 1600 and 7938 and the Core i5-1235U at 1668 and 7671.

Clearly Qualcomm has a way to go before it catches up with Apple Intel and AMD. Even so the ThinkPad X13s was fast enough during my testing for the usual productivity tasks. I could keep quite a few browser tabs open and run background apps like Outlook Teams and others without any noticeable hesitation. But I wouldn’t rely on the laptop for the most demanding workflows or creative tasks.

The ThinkPad X13s wouldn’t run the 3DMark Time Spy test our primary gaming synthetic benchmark. And I didn’t see a reason to try running Fortnite our go-to game for integrated graphics. It’s doubtful that the Snapdragon GPU can play anything more than the oldest titles (should they install and actually run) at low resolutions and graphics. And that’s OK because by no means is the ThinkPad X13s meant to be a gaming laptop.

According to Lenovo three displays are available for the ThinkPad X13s and they are all 13.3-inch 16:10 WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS panels. There’s an antiglare 300-nit touch display an antiglare 400-nit low power non-touch display and a 300-nit non-touch display. My review unit used the latter panel which seemed like a quality display during my testing. Colors were dynamic and natural the display was bright enough for my usual working conditions and blacks seemed true and not grayish.

Unlike with previous Windows on ARM laptops I’ve reviewed the ThinkPad X13s supported my colorimeter. That’s significant because it shows the platform has expanded its peripheral driver support and the applications it will run. And according to my colorimeter the ThinkPad’s display is a solid productivity panel. It was bright enough at 341 nits above our 300-nit standard but lower than the other displays in our comparison group. Its contrast was high at 1380:1 well above our 1000:1 threshold for premium displays. Colors were at the premium laptop average at 100% of sRGB and 77% of AdobeRGB with a color accuracy of DeltaE 1.12 (1.0 or less is considered excellent).

The ThinkPad X13s display is excellent for productivity workers and media consumers but it doesn’t have quite the color width for demanding creators.

Two upward-firing speakers provide audio one on each side of the keyboard. They offered adequate volume during my testing with clear mids and highs and the usual lack of bass. They’re good enough for YouTube and videoconferencing but Netflix bingers and music listeners will want to utilize some headphones .

Keyboard touchpad and webcam

Open the lid and you’ll find the familiar ThinkPad keyboard with large sculpted keycaps and plenty of key spacing. The switches were lighter than some ThinkPads I’ve tested with a snappy bottoming action and a quick response that made for fast comfortable typing. I’m not always a huge fan of ThinkPad keyboards sometimes finding them too stiff but this one ranked up there with HP’s Spectre and Dell’s XPS keyboards. The layout is different from the typical Windows 11 keyboard following the ThinkPad pattern including the left Fn and Ctrl buttons being swapped. There are several special function keys including a couple for videoconferencing and one for opening Lenovo’s Commercial Vantage utility.

The touchpad is wider than on some ThinkPads but it still loses some space to the buttons that service the TrackPoint nubbin. The touchpad glass surface is smooth and comfortable and provides reliable support for Windows 11 multitouch gestures and the button clicks are confident and quiet. The TrackPoint nubbin works as well as always for anyone who prefers that control. The display on my review unit wasn’t touch-enabled but there’s an option for a touchscreen.

The webcam utilizes a 5MP sensor and is quite high resolution and Lenovo uses some AI features to calibrate the color and brightness of the image regardless of lighting conditions. There are options for applying high dynamic range ( HDR ) to video and enabling automatic framing to keep the user’s face in the center of the image.

Finally an infrared camera provides Windows Hello support via facial recognition and there’s a fingerprint reader built into the recessed power button. Both passwordless login methods worked quickly and reliably.

Privacy and security

The keyboard includes a dedicated key for shuttering the webcam and there’s another key for switching off the microphones.

The ThinkPad X13s is Microsoft Pluton ready which means there’s a security processor embedded in the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 to protect against various threats and physical attacks. The laptop also includes Lenovo’s self-healing BIOS to recover the machine in the case of corruption or attack.

Battery life

The ThinkPad X13s has 49.5 watt-hours of battery capacity which is a decent amount for a laptop with the ultra-efficient Qualcomm ARM CPU and a Full HD+ display. It’s less than the Lenovo Flex 5G that comes in at 60 watt-hours but more than the HP Elite Folio‘s 46 watt-hours.

Take the Flex 5G out of the equation and I’d say the ThinkPad X13s did very well in battery tests. It hit 11.75 hours in our web-browsing test that cycles through a series of demanding websites and 19.5 hours in our video test that loops a local Full HD Avengers trailer. Those are strong results compared to most Intel laptops and promise all-day battery life and then some. The Elite Folio was close enough to the same results. However the Flex 5G did significantly better in both tests more than the increase in battery size would predict making it the champ among the Snapdragon 8cx machines we’ve tested. And the Apple MacBook Air laptops also did better than the ThinkPad both the M1 and M2 versions although neither beat out the Flex 5G .

Even so the ThinkPad X13s provided good enough battery life that it’s worth the performance trade-off if you don’t have demanding workflows. At least that’s true compared to the Intel field. As with performance the ThinkPad X13s doesn’t compete as strongly with Apple’s ARM CPUs.

Our take

All-day battery life? Check. Always-connected internet? Check. Excellent performance? Not so much. That pretty much sums up the ThinkPad X13s and Windows on ARM generally. Qualcomm and Microsoft have made some strides for sure. The Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 is the fastest yet and Windows on ARM supports more apps and drivers than before. But it’s still nowhere close to Intel AMD or Apple when it comes to an overall experience.

For the right person though the ThinkPad x13s is a nicely portable laptop with great battery life. Everyone else should wait to see what’s coming next.

Are there any alternatives?

There are more 5G laptops available today than just a year or so ago but the population of Windows on ARM machines is still rather small. The Lenovo Flex 5G is unavailable but the HP Elite Folio can still be purchased. It’s not as fast but it offers similar battery life and 5G connectivity. It’s also a fascinating convertible 2-in-1 with a gorgeous look and a comfortable feel.

If you’re primarily looking for a thin and light laptop and are enamored of the ThinkPad brand then the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a solid option. It’s one of the smallest and lightest laptops at just 1.99 pounds offering solid productivity performance and battery life that rivals the ThinkPad X13s. It doesn’t provide 5G WWAN support however.

Finally the Apple MacBook Air M2 is a highly competitive alternative for anyone who doesn’t live for Windows 11 and doesn’t need 5G . It’s fast incredibly well-built has some of the best battery life and it’s one of the thinnest laptops at 0.44 inches.

How long will it last?

The Lenovo ThinkPad X13s is built well enough that you should expect years of service. It’s questionable whether the CPU will keep up with Windows on ARM’s development but that remains to be seen. The industry-standard one-year warranty is disappointing on a ThinkPad.

Should you buy it?

Yes if you don’t need the fastest performance but want long battery life and 5G connectivity. The ThinkPad X13s is a great laptop for all but the most demanding users.

I try to stay away from exact brands and move the conversation into what I believe are necessary characteristics of the cards that I will put in my digital equipment. Three things stand out. I want storage that has high sustained write speeds for those times that I push the camera. That storage must provide the best data transfer speeds and last but not least I want a card that maintains acceptable temps under pressure. These tests are the regimen of our CFExpress testing.

ProGrade Digital sent along a new release which follows along the line of their Cobalt 625GB and their Cobalt 325GB cards that we reviewed almost two years ago. It seems to be the little brother of the 625GB Cobalt that I have had in my EOS R5 since reviewing it. This card is intended for those that don’t need the massive storage of the 625GB; it seems to be intended for the photographer specifically…but with the very same specs and an attractive price to match.

The ProGrade Digital 165GB Cobalt CFExpress Type B card boasts impressive transfer speeds of 1700MB/s read 1500MB/s write and 1400MB/s sustained write performance which would make it a class leader. It is based on a PCIE Gen 3.0 framework and uses the NVMe 1.3 host controller interface. Checking Amazon the Cobalt 165GB is priced at $179.99.

TSSDR TEST BENCH AND PROTOCOL

CFExpress Card testing at TSSDR differs slightly depending on whether we are looking at consumer or enterprise storage media. For our ProGrade Digital CFExpress Type B Card testing today our goal is to test in a system that has been optimized with our SSD Optimization Guide.

For this Test Bench the CPU C-States Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology (EIST) and Intel Speedshift (P-States) have not been disabled. As you will see below the system is also bumped to 5.1GHz with memory at full speed in its XMP 2 profile.

The components of this Test Bench are detailed below. All hardware is linked for purchase and product sales may be reached by a simple click on the individual item.

BENCHMARK SOFTWARE

The software in use for today’s analysis is typical of many of our reviews and consists of Crystal Disk Info ATTO Disk Benchmark Crystal Disk Mark Anvil’s Storage Utilities AJA TxBench as well as Sustained Disk Transfer Temperature and True Data Transfer Rate Testing. Our selection of software allows each to build on the last and to provide validation to results already obtained.

For our testing today we will be relying on the pictured PCIe 3.0 x4 CFExpress reader created for us by Lexar some time ago. As a bit of confirmation we always test with multiple readers we have on hand and of both the ThunderBolt 3 and the newer USB 3.2 2×2 spec. There shouldn’t be a difference in any of these devices as the top speed of CFExpress is well below the threshold of all readers ( and our AIC Gen 3 reader) whether they be Thunderbolt 3/4 with a threshold of 2.8GB/s or USB 3.2 2×2 with a top speed of 2GB/s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvaGVyZXMtZ2Vuc2hpbi1pbXBhY3RzLTMwLXVwZGF0ZS1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Genshin Impact's 3.0 update release date,"A new livestream has revealed more about Genshin Impact's upcoming 3.0 update The Morn a Thousand Rose Brings.

Along with a lengthy new teaser video - which you can see below - we learned that 3.0 entitled The Morn a Thousand Rose Brings is all set to release on 24th August 2022.

As Jessica recently summarised for us 3.0 brings the Sumeru region to the game the Dendro element continues the main storyline and will introduce lots of new characters. We now know these include four-star Electro Dori along with upcoming additions five-star Dendro Tighnari and Collei the latter of which - who is a four-star Dendro specialist - can be added for free via the Graven Innocence event. Zhongli is making a return along with Ganyu and Kokomi all of whom are five-star.

""See with thine eyes the luxuriant verdure embowering the mountains"" begins a poetic video description. ""Savor with thine nose the fragrant roses overlaying the meadows. Hear the larking of flamboyant birds at daybreak / Hear them unveil wisdom silenced for centuries.""

We also learned that the next three versions will release every five weeks as opposed to the usual six-week pattern so version 3.1 3.2 and 3.3 will release on 28th September 2nd November and 7th December respectively.

Genshin Impact 2.8 update released on 13th July 2022. Entitled Summer Fantasia 2.8 brought a new look to the Golden Apple Archipelago as well as new events a new character and new location Sumeru - which hopefully we'll get to explore in more detail in 3.0.

Genshin Impact is showing no sign of slowing down. The free-to-play Breath of the Wild-like has reportedly raked in over $3bn since its release in September 2020.

Meanwhile in addition to Genshin Impact HoYoverse has also announced its next game - Zenless Zone Zero. HoYoverse describes this new title as an urban fantasy and an ""attempt to further explore action-oriented gameplay"".

Any Iowan who has toured the state Capitol is familiar with the World War II-vintage battleship that bore that name: The 18 1/2 foot 1350-pound shipbuilder's model of the now-retired vessel has occupied a place of honor just off the rotunda for more than 50 years aweing generations of children on school field trips.

Now a 377-foot 7000-ton submarine nearing completion at General Dynamics Electric Boat is set to carry on the legacy. Christening of the Virginia-class nuclear attack submarine as the USS Iowa is expected early next year with former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack wielding the champagne bottle at the company's Groton Connecticut shipyard.

As the christening nears the SSN 797 Commissioning Committee — which uses the ship's current official designation — is ramping up activities to both raise money for the privately sponsored event and introduce the 130-plus-member crew to Iowans.

Two of those events are scheduled in the next few days. From 4-6 p.m. Sunday crew members will be on hand for a meet-and-greet at the new Des Moines taproom of Big Grove Brewing a committee sponsor at 555 17th St. Then on Monday Gov. Kim Reynolds accompanied by crew members and the sub's commanding officer Matthew Powell will appear at a 1:30 p.m. ceremony at the Iowa State Fair where Reynolds will declare August USS Iowa month.

""We're trying to get as many people involved as we can as we build up interest"" said Mathew Tanner a Cedar Rapids native who is a test engineer at Electric Boat and executive director of the commissioning committee.

A contingent of USS Iowa crew rode in the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa in July and crew members appeared at Waterloo's Irish Fest earlier this month and visited that city's Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum which memorializes the five Sullivan brothers from Iowa all U.S. Navy sailors who died in the World War II sinking of the USS Juneau.

Tanner said the commissioning committee has assembled a network of Iowa families that host the Iowa crew during visits.

""We want them to get face-to-face with that friendly Iowa atmosphere we have"" he said.

The committee's goal is to ensure a robust turnout of Iowans for the christening. And the events won't end there. Once christened the Iowa will set out for up to eight months of sea trials. When those are satisfactorily completed she will be commissioned in a full-dress ceremony as a U.S. Navy vessel Tanner said.

The new Iowa the 24th of 37 planned Virginia class submarines will have an important distinction as the first of the $2 billion vessels specifically equipped to accommodate female crew members Tanner said.

It will be the third U.S. Navy vessel to bear the name. The most famous of course is the battleship the first of its class launched 80 years ago this month in 1942. Its final decommissioning came in 1990 and it's now a floating museum at the Port of Los Angeles in California (to which anyone with an Iowa driver's license can get free admission).

The first USS Iowa launched in 1896 was a battleship that saw action in the Spanish-American War.

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated how many Virginia class submarines are planned.

Pittsfield improved to 2-0 with two games remaining in round-robin pool play at the event. They take the field again on Monday morning against another Virginia squad Southeast Regional champion Winchester at 10 a.m.

On Sunday Pittsfield did all its damage early taking a 4-0 lead in the bottom of the second and relying on Connor Paronto and Cam Hillard to do the rest on the mound.

""I think these guys after a day off [Saturday] got some swings in early"" Pittsfield Manager Ben Stohr said. ""When we got to the field today for [batting practice] at 2:30 it looked like half the team was already hitting with their parents.

""It was good to see them come up strong.""

For second game in a row the New England Regional Champs got things started with a run in the first inning.

Barry led off the bottom of the frame by working a seven-pitch walk.

He then stole second and came home on Eddie Ferris' RBI double to center field.

""Speed on the base paths has helped us"" Stohr said. ""There were a couple of miscues there late. We were trying to scrape together more. Three runs is really never enough. We tried a few things that didn't go our way.""

Pittsfield ended up 2-for-4 in stolen base attempts on the afternoon.

Defensively Pittsfield catcher Jackson Almeida held the team from Manassas Va. to 1-for-2 on the base paths.

Pittsfield expanded its lead with a three-run second inning.

Brenden Socie got things started with a leadoff single. He moved up on a groundout from Robby Bazinet and got to third with Pittsfield's second stolen base of the day.

After Ryan Stannard drew a walk Socie came home on a balk and Barry tripled home Stannard to make it 3-0.

With two out Morrie Fried doubled to center field to drive in Barry.

That did it for Pittsfield's offense which got 2-for-3 days from Fried and Luke Ferguson.

On the mound Paronto stranded two runners in the first and two in third to keep the Virginians scoreless.

In the fourth he gave up a walk and a single to start the inning.

Manassas' Nick McKinney hit an RBI single to get his team on the board.

But Paronto got the next batter looking at a called third strike Almeida threw out a runner attempting to steal third on the front end of a double-steal and the final out popped up to Barry at shortstop.

Getting out of the early jam with just one run allowed was key and showed the trust that Stohr has in Paronto.

""I think that's part of those guys' success"" he said of Paronto's and Hillard's success with runners on base. ""They've seen that if things aren't going their way it's just on to the next batter and trust their defense.

""Unfortunately they've worked with a lot of runners on base but it also makes them more comfortable in that situation. We tell them to just go play catch with the catcher back there and Jackson is a great backstop.""

Paronto finished with one strikeout and one walk while scattering five hits.

Hillard did not allow a hit but walked two batters in three innings of work to close out the game.

Stohr said Hillard is available for Monday's 10 a.m. first pitch but the plan is to give the ball to Fried.

""Morrie has thrown a lot of good bullpens for us and threw a couple of times in regionals"" Stohr said. ""He has excellent stuff when he's on.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1hdmlhdGlvbi9haXJjcmFmdC1wcm9wdWxzaW9uL2Zhc3QtNS1ndWxmc3RyZWFtLXByZXNpZGVudC1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0aW9uLW1hcmtldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fast 5: Gulfstream President On Certification The Market,"Gulfstream’s leader Mark Burns discusses the company’s new aircraft certification progress customer base the market and service center network during the Farnborough Airshow.

We’re here in Farnborough. What makes the Gulfstream service center here special?

Number one it was purpose-built for this market and for business aviation. So we have a very automated means of servicing airplanes. We’ve been able to hire because the airfield’s conducive to the technical capabilities we need.

Are you expanding your European customer base with the new aircraft or are inflationary pressures starting to take effect?

The markets have been good. There was an inflection point when the vaccine became available. and most people determined there was a path forward—the unknown became more known. Since that point we have had some of the best quarters that we’ve had in my almost 40 years. The last five quarters have been some of our best. But there always is the question ‘how long is it going to last?’ I think that there’s been a shift in thinking during COVID and I think more people who didn’t own airplanes before and maybe used charter or fractional ownership decided that they should own their own airplane. We’ve had a lot of first-time buyers. We’ve had quarters as high as maybe almost 30% new buyers—people who have never owned an airplane before.

And the market continues to expand. We’re selling a lot more airplanes in Southeast Asia. So it’s not just a Western market anymore. It’s really a global market for us. So yes the market is good but you always have to weigh the circumstances of the moment—so inflation and the potential of recession for instance. You have to deal with that but I think we’re really good at it.

We’re a cyclical industry so you have to be able to accommodate what the moment is telling you. But for us it’s pretty strong right now. I think we’re selling out into 2025 and 2026. So I feel good about where we’re positioned. And whatever may come over the next year or so I think we’re well positioned to weather it.

Given the new aircraft family playbook that you orchestrated and kept secret for so long how does that position the company for the future?

We did keep secret the whole plan for many many years and now to be able to show that we’re going to build the G400 G500 G600 G700 and the G800—that’s going to create tremendous efficiency for us over time as we certify the three remaining airplanes in the family. When we get beyond that then our real focus will be becoming more and more efficient. The commonality that we’ve created across those airplanes will really give us the opportunity to become very very efficient over the years.

How confident are you that the G500/G600 software fix will be resolved in September?

We’ve made really good progress. The FAA has been outstanding. We’ve had the software in hand for more than a year now. We’re demonstrating it to the FAA to make sure that they understand what we’ve done and that it effectively addresses the concern. Certification flying for the software update began on July 22.

When we set out the plan we sat down with the FAA and said ‘here’s what we’re capable of.’ We showed them what we had been doing for the last year. They agreed. I feel like September is still doable.

Do you have a new date for the G800 certification?

The G800 certification is planned for the end of 2023 or early 2024. During the last [General Dynamics] earnings call the chairman said we have three to six months of risk. I think that still holds true. If there’s a silver lining to the cloud of what we’ve been doing with the G500 I think both the FAA and us learned what we need to do to validate software under this new rule that came out in 2021. I think we both have a clear path of what needs to be done which minimizes some of the risks that we thought we had. I don’t think the risk mitigates at all but we’ll get some efficiency going forward on the G700 and G800. I think there’s still three to six months of risk on the G700 and the G800 will follow a year later maybe a little sooner if all goes well. But there’s such commonality between the G700 and G800 so there are a number of things that we don’t have to duplicate on the 800. For instance we’ll do lightning tests and flying into known icing tests on the G700 and then we won’t have to repeat those same tests on the G800.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzEzL29iaXR1YXJ5amFuZXQtdHJhc2stZ3JvbmRpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: Janet Trask Grondin,"BRUNSWICK – Janet Trask Grondin of Brunswick passed away Thursday August 4 2022 surrounded by her family and close friends at her Lake Molunkus Sporting camps business in Aroostook County. Janet fought a courageous 10-month battle against glioblastoma.

She was born in Damariscotta on June 3 1957 to Chester and Elaine Trask. Janet was educated in the Wiscasset school system and received her bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from the university of Maine.

Janet had an extraordinary professional drive that resulted in multiple management positions and project leads of both finance and human resources during her 42-year career at General Dynamics Bath Iron works.

Janet was an avid outdoors woman who loved to hunt and fish. She was also very athletic participating on a women’s basketball team competing in triathlons at Bowdoin College and Wild Cat Mountain in New Hampshire. She also traveled to Ireland to compete in a marathon to raise funds for the Maine Lung Association.

From an early age Janet loved showing her beautiful horses Miss Valor and Masters Jubilee. Janet often noted her love for her dog a boxer named Kallee soon to be 13.

Janet was predeceased by her parents Chester “Chet” and Elaine Trask; her maternal grandparents Alfred and Marjorie (Dodge) Dowling; paternal grandparents Nelson and Esther Trask; nephew Shawn York.

Janet is survived by her sisters Colleen Leonard of Brunswick Joan Smyrski and partner Don Williams of Jefferson; niece Beth York Barter husband Sam Barter and their children Brogan and Madison Barter all of Boothbay; fiancé William Quimby of Bath. AFS sister Ana Colina Cozrea (Coteaux) of Iquique Chile and Florida.

A celebration of Janet’s life will be held later this fall with family and close friends.

The new Dollop General Store and Café is decorated with a neutral-colored floor-to-ceiling map of Evanston a tall sliding window for fresh-air dining wooden accent tables a phone booth and many plants giving the shop a minimalistic yet homey feel.

The location opened July 16 in the downtown Albion Evanston. It is the first location with a cafe-store concept opened by the Dollop Coffee Company chain which got its start as a small cafe in Chicago more than 15 years ago.

After diners finish conversing and enjoying a warm cappuccino at the cafe they can wander through the small shop and buy pantry items like condiments pasta cereal and even necessities like paper towels or natural soap.

“It has a bodega feel” co-manager Kory Kenehan said. “You can shop and then hang out.”

Open seven days a week the shop allows customers to try something new or stick to the favorites selling Dollop brand items and others from big name companies like Kellogg’s General Mills and Pepperidge Farm.

The coffee bar sitting at the center of the joint and aligned with modern wooden mini tables appeals to a variety of sweet and savory cravings with food like vegan glazed donuts and turkey club sandwiches.

The shop’s specialty drink is the Nutella Mocha according to Kenahan which he said he always recommends to patrons when they ask to be surprised.

Customer Elaine Kemna-Irish said she has been to the cafe a couple times and has enjoyed the coffee.

“It’s really nice that they have a marketplace in the shop the coffee’s good and I like to come in here and draw” Kemna-Irish said.

Kemna-Irish said she frequented another Dollop location and is happy there is finally one in Evanston.

Stephanie Irish who accompanied Kemna-Irish to the store said she was drawn by the interior design of the shop especially the lobby area because it has a retro welcoming vibe.

“I like the shape of the mirrors” Irish said. “You can really tell that it was very thought out.”

There are some special deals in the shop such as a free small coffee with the purchase of a board game from the ‘Netflix & Chill’ rack which includes Connect Four Guess Who? and others.

Kenehan said he has known the owner Dan Weiss for more than 20 years and talks to him frequently about next steps for the location often making suggestions.

Among the many ideas for innovations are building a stage for open-mic and comedy shows selling vinyls and filling up one of the shop pillars with work from local artists.

Kenehan said as the staff expands the store is expected to remain open until 10 p.m. He added that one of his favorite things about the shop is that it will continue to evolve.

“We’re really trying to make it a fun place” Kenehan said. “I like that customers can come in tell us they want something and we stock it.”

The Minneapolis retailer made visible strides in that time but a review of its benchmarks shows it still has a way to go to meet all of its goals.

Target increased its share of Black company officers added more year-round products by Black entrepreneurs and expanded its base of contractors. While some experts suggest retailers' interest in diversity is declining Target executives vow to stay the course.

""You would never have a financial office that didn't set goals that didn't set targets"" said Kiera Fernandez Target's chief diversity and inclusion officer. ""We have to have that same mindset when we think of diversity equity and inclusion.""

Target leaders say they had already begun work to better serve Black workers and customers when Floyd's murder on Memorial Day 2020 led to more calls for action about ending the unfair treatment of Black people in America.

In summer 2020 Target formed the REACH (Racial Equity Action and Change) committee to spearhead some new lofty visions such as creating retail environments in which Black customers felt welcomed and finding new ways to help grow the prosperity of Black communities.

Target has since added more tangible benchmarks and financial commitments including promising to contribute $100 million through 2025 to Black-led organizations; spend more than $2 billion on Black-owned businesses including marketing agencies and construction companies by the end of 2025; and spend 5% of Target's annual media budget on Black-owned media this year.

Target is not the only company to focus more on diversity and equity since Floyd's death. Retailers including Nordstrom Sephora Macy's Ulta Beauty and the Gap have accepted the Fifteen Percent Pledge which was launched in 2020 to advocate for Black businesses to make up 15% of retailers' shelf space.

""The pandemic mixed with social changes has made many consumers demand more from their retailers"" said Kim Sovell a marketing professor at the University of St. Thomas. ""I'm not talking about good prices. I'm talking about thoughtfulness.""

According to McKinsey & Co. nearly half of consumers they recently surveyed in the United States believe companies should pledge to support Black-owned brands and vendors with a larger percentage of younger consumers including Gen Zers and millennials thinking that's important. Also Black consumers who have historically been underserved have hundreds of billions of dollars of buying power that they are willing to redirect research shows.

At Target one of the REACH committee's big priorities has been to increase the variety of products by Black founders. Target currently offers more than 100 Black-owned items which the retailer began to label in 2020. Target now aims to sell more than 500 products from Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025.

Tabitha Brown is one of the latest Black designers that Target has partnered with.

One of Target's new partnerships has been with Black actress and social media influencer Tabitha Brown. She recently released the second of her four colorful Target collections of apparel home goods and kitchenware.

""I love fashion and I studied fashion in school and that was one of my dreams to do clothing and a line and never would I have ever dreamt that my first [assortment] would have been at Target"" Brown said.

Brown who is 43 said when she was growing up she didn't see a lot of Black girls and women represented at major retailers.

""We deserve to be in spaces with everybody else"" she said. ""We deserve to be seen. We deserve to be heard. And so I think the world has finally caught on to that.""

In another improvement Target said it doubled the amount of its Black-owned partners since 2020. Target is finalizing an advertising partnership with Sheletta Brundidge a local Black comedian and radio host who criticized Target last year for not supporting Twin Cities Black media outlets.

""People are asking for receipts"" Brundidge said. ""Did you honor your commitments? Did you do what you said you are going to do?""

Target plans to buy ads on Brundidge's podcast network. General Mills is another recent sponsor for her podcast she said.

""We aren't going to have no Black businesses if our Fortune 500 companies don't hire us as vendors"" Brundidge said. ""It's long overdue.""

Target also increased the number of Black workers in higher positions. Last fiscal year 10% of its officers were Black up from 5% in 2019. Black employees accounted for 15.5% of its overall workforce last year compared to 15.6% in 2019.

The retailer has also experienced some difficult moments. Last year several employees at the St. Paul Midway Target complained about a Juneteenth break room display they said played into Black stereotypes with a table of cherry Kool-Aid packets watermelon candy and servings of hot sauce.

Some have also pointed out that the retailer over the years has closed Target stores in urban Black neighborhoods.

Target representatives said it follows a rigorous process to evaluate the performance of every store and the company continues to stay committed to open locations that serve all customers including new stores in Flatbush a neighborhood in New York City and Los Angeles' Inglewood neighborhood.

Lul Osman shopped for body wash at Target earlier this month.

Jesse Ross a Minneapolis-based diversity and inclusion consultant said he thinks many companies who were vocal about supporting racial equity in the wake of Floyd's death have begun to turn their focus to other business challenges.

""I think the stamina for folks committed to these diversity goals has changed. ... The majority of the culture doesn't want to do the work"" Ross said.

Fernandez acknowledges some diversity goals may not be reached in the time that Target originally wanted. She also said that despite strategies and policies it is still possible for individual employees to make mistakes that could go against Target's inclusivity intentions. There's ""no endpoint"" to the company's diversity efforts Fernandez said.

""We are not perfect"" she said. ""We are in pursuit of equity inclusion and a place where everyone is seen and valued. And along the way we will bump our head and bump our toe because we are all humans.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaGFybG90dGUvbmFtZS93YWx0ZXItYmF1ZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzYwNjgzMDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walter Bauer Obituary (1938 - 2022) - Charlotte NC - Charlotte Observer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/charlotte/name/walter-bauer-obituary?id=36068302 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaGFybG90dGUvbmFtZS93YWx0ZXItYmF1ZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzYwNjgzMDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYWxsaGlwaG9wLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Nub29wLWRvZ2ctZHJvcHMtaGlzLW93bi1jZXJlYWwtY2FsbGVkLXNub29wLWxvb3B6L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snoop Dogg Drops His Own Cereal Called 'Snoop Loopz',"Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)

The Long Beach OG wants to be a part of your breakfast routine.

Master P is not the only rapper in the food industry making products that everyone can place in their cupboards pantries and kitchen tables. One West Coast pioneer who used to be signed to his No Limit Records label is venturing into this space through a joint-venture with his mentor where he is launching a breakfast cereal to rival your favorite Kelloggs or General Mills staple.

Snoop Dogg has debuted his newest venture Broadus Foods. The first offering is Snoop Loopz a sweet treat that looks like Froot Loops with marshmallows. The box has a cute blue dog ( duh ) holding a spoon.

Master P took to Twitter to make the announcement. He wrote “MORE Corn MORE Flavor & MORE Marshmallows that’s what separates us from the Rest. If you like Fruit Loops then you will LOVE SnoopLoopz!! http://SNOOPLOOPZ.COM”

Snoop reposted on Instagram with this caption “Broadus Foods introduces the best tasting cereal in the game Snoop loopz. @snoopdogg we’re taking over the grocery stores. Snooploopz.com – The more we make the more we give. #GODisgood #familybusiness Berry delicious Fo Shizzle!”

We knew Snoop was heavy in the food space when he started hanging around with food and lifestyle expert Martha Stewart.

AllHipHop.com reported that Snoop believes his former “Martha and Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party” co-host has opened up this world to him making success with a different market accessible despite their backgrounds being so distant.

He said “Me and her together it’s always beautiful we always enjoy each other’s company. It just shows the world that love is love!

“If you get a chance to sit around somebody talk to them understand them you can become friends with them no matter what color they are where they come from how old they are race background religion” the “Gin and Juice” artist continued.

“And that’s what we doing we break all the stereotypes when we’re together” he stated. “We make the world feel like it’s OK.”

They work so well together the two have decided to put a product on the market. Snoop just laced Martha with her own brand of 49 Crimes win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvZmVtYWlsL2FydGljbGUtMTEwOTYzMjMvT25jZS1jb25zaWRlcmVkLXRlcm1pbmFsbHktdHJhc2h5LU1pbGxzLUJvb24tbm92ZWxzLWxlZ2lvbnMtYXZpZC1uZXctZmFucy5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTA5NjMyMy9hbXAvT25jZS1jb25zaWRlcmVkLXRlcm1pbmFsbHktdHJhc2h5LU1pbGxzLUJvb24tbm92ZWxzLWxlZ2lvbnMtYXZpZC1uZXctZmFucy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Once considered terminally trashy Mills & Boon novels now have legions of avid new fans,"You are jetting off to Greece leaving your stressful life behind you for two glorious weeks. A beachy holiday calls for a beachy read: as you peruse the shelves of your local bookshop you avoid anything by Hanya Yanagihara (too depressing) Umberto Eco (too highbrow) Jonathan Franzen (too confusing) Hilary Mantel (too historical) and any blurb containing the words ‘postwar’ ‘intergenerational’ or ‘dystopian’. You want romance. You want passion. You want levity. You want Mills & Boon.

Only you can’t be seen with Mills & Boon because in the pantheon of trashy undemanding holiday reads this particular imprint is too trashy and undemanding even for your lowbrow literary tastes. People will snigger at you by the pool. Reading Mills & Boon is like dancing to ‘Agadoo’ wearing frosted pink lipstick or sipping a sex-on-the-beach cocktail.

At least it used to be. Thanks to a random confluence of circumstances as unlikely as the plot of one of its books the 114-year-old imprint is enjoying a revival. Partly its resuscitated fortunes come courtesy of TikTok or more specifically #BookTok dubbed ‘the last wholesome place on the internet’ on account of its earnest recommendation of novels old and new many of which have then gone on to sell tens of thousands of copies a month. With more than 67.5 billion views and counting the hashtag has hugely revived the fantasy and romance genres flipping the idea of Mills & Boon as a guilty pleasure and rebranding it as a choice if not to be proud of then at least unashamed.

That the romantic fiction imprint founded in 1908 by Gerald Rusgrove Mills and Charles Boon has captured Gen Z’s imagination isn’t so surprising given its fascination with the recent past. Much as Gen Z fetishises the style of Princess Diana and the music of Kate Bush so too does it worship the retro graphics outlandish plots and old-fashioned titles of historic Mills & Boon novels with those hailing from the 80s finding particular favour. #Millsandboon currently has 564.2K views with users proudly documenting their collections. ‘How’s this for vintage smut?’ asks one user holding up a trio of books titled Arrogant Interloper Tiger In His Lair and A Handful Of Stars. That the rainbow-coloured spines look good on Gen Z’s bookshelves only adds to their appeal.

But it’s not just their aesthetic that is fanning the flames: the content is compelling too. Nineteen-year-old Evie first encountered a Mills & Boon novel while visiting her grandmother in Knaresborough. ‘I only started reading it because I’d forgotten my phone charger and had nothing else to do’ she recalls. ‘But then I kind of got hooked. The plot was cheesy but I liked that and also that it was so vanilla. Boys my age have grown up on a diet of phone porn. Vanilla they are not. Maybe I enjoy the Mills & Boon heroes because they’re old-fashioned and romantic with all the stereotypical behaviour that brings. I consider myself a feminist but I’d still like to be swept off my feet and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. I’d say it’s the same reason so many teenagers love Bridgerton.’

It’s ironic perhaps that while Gen Z is enjoying the original unreconstructed Mills & Boon novels its publisher HarperCollins is set on reinventing them. Recent offerings have seen the brand respond to cultural changes by incorporating queer storylines and becoming more racially inclusive as well as revising its covers to embrace a more contemporary look.

I consider myself a feminist but I’d still like to be swept off my feet

Last month it welcomed a new author to its stable in the form of 24-year-old Amber Rose Gill the Newcastle beautician who won the 2019 series of Love Island alongside Irish rugby player Greg O’Shea. That their love story didn’t last was no impediment to Gill penning one of her own – in which she could create the heroes she wanted.

Before you could say ‘throbbing with desire’ Gill (with the help of seasoned Mills & Boon co-writer 52-year-old Nadine Gonzalez) had replaced prosaic Greg with dashing Roman the handsome protagonist of Until I Met You. ‘Fed up with his corporate job after years in New York Roman was starting again in Tobago’ reads the blurb. ‘The last thing he needed was a distraction especially a free-spirited travel blogger. But something about Samantha inspired a protective instinct in Roman…’

While the story sounds straight out of 1983 the book’s heroine Samantha is independent and strong-willed according to Gill and far feistier than M&B heroines of old who tend to swoon at the merest hint of a marriage proposal. Equally feminist and independent are the heroines in Made in Chelsea alumna Georgia Toffolo’s books whose Meet Me… series touches upon subjects such as infertility and disability with a multiracial cast of characters. So far they’ve sold more than 100000 copies. And let’s not forget Sarah Ferguson Duchess of York whose debut historical thriller Her Heart For a Compass was a top-ten bestseller. Published last year and based on the duchess’s own ancestor the 500-plus-page romance tells of the red-headed Lady Margaret Montagu Scott who flees an arranged marriage to find true love. Ferguson also hosts a successful Mills & Boon book club.

Mills & Boon won’t be drawn on who is implementing this drive for (heavily ghostwritten) celebrity authors and modern inclusive storylines but says it has always tried to be representative of the times. ‘We’re looking for talented new writers from all backgrounds cultures and communities’ says marketing director Katie Barnes-Wallis. ‘Our Love To Write competition in which we partnered with Amber Rose Gill was launched to find romance writers from under-represented ethnic backgrounds to increase racial diversity and representation within the romance genre. Georgia Toffolo’s love of books and reading was evident from her social media and her online book club and her stories have reached a new generation of readers who are discovering books through social media.’ Over half of the brand’s Facebook and Instagram followers are under the age of 44 with the 25-34 age group being the fastest growing sector across both platforms.

While the pandemic has undoubtedly fuelled an increase in book sales – fiction was up 20 per cent compared with 2019 according to data analysts Nielsen – it’s the romance genre that is particularly on fire with a volume growth of 49 per cent compared to 23 per cent for science fiction and 19 per cent for the crime and thriller genre. With one of its books sold every ten seconds in the UK Mills & Boon is the schmaltzy jewel in the romance genre’s crown beloved by readers despite being sniffed at by the literati.

‘They’ve been savaged and disparaged by critics but the public has always read what it wants to’ notes Christina Bunce director and co-founder of the Professional Writing Academy whose Writing Romance course (taught by a former Mills & Boon writer) is popular with those eager to pen books for the brand. ‘Literary quality has never led sales. Who’s to say one form of literature is worse than another? Many people don’t want to read literary fiction that provokes existential exploration. Mills & Boon provides a fun read expertly crafted. All books have a narrative structure and they’ve mastered the art of storytelling that all the best literature embodies – it’s just the subject matter that’s different.’

It’s a subject matter so compelling packaged so enticingly that it has spread much further than the printed page. Hit Netflix series including Virgin River and Sweet Magnolias are based on Mills & Boon books. Thor: Love and Thunder director Taika Waititi admitted to Wired magazine that he was influenced by the iconic 1930s covers of its novels when shaping the look and feel of the new Marvel film.

Whether on film TV TikTok or the beach this is undoubtedly Mills & Boon’s hot book summer. Not bad for a 114-year-old.

Maddy Fletcher reveals the essential ingredients of a Mills & Boon bestseller

Maddy Fletcher reveals the essential ingredients of a Mills & Boon bestseller

One heroine

In the past the more passive porcelain and prudish the heroine the better. Now leading ladies can have more bite. Divorcées single mothers and even (brace yourself) working women are all allowed – but she must no matter the circumstances always need saving.

One ridiculous title

Previous examples include: Apollo’s Seed Love and the Kentish Maid Master of Marshlands Mystery at Butlin’s and Grace Before Meat. Let your imagination run wild.

At least two sex scenes

No messing around here. A few tender embraces plenty of trembling and quivering and the odd wave of ecstasy will do the trick.

One hero

Still mostly alpha males. Tanned skin is a bonus as is a strong jaw and a big bank account. Greek tycoons possessive sheikhs billionaire CEOs repressed aristocrats and workaholic doctors are all tried-and-tested successes. Russian oligarchs have done well in the past but perhaps not in the current climate.

One big fight

Ideally this should take place three-quarters of the way through the story. It will almost certainly be caused by male ineptitude.

One last-minute resolution

Happy endings are mandatory in Mills & Boon. A cheery epilogue describing blissed-out married life with perfect babies is preferred."

It is planned to hit the market in 2023 and is expected to set the standard for off-road electric UTVs with new technologies creating a thrilling off-road experience currently non-existent in the marketplace.For GM's part the agreement fits with their rapid escalation of efforts to transform from a gas-powered automaker into an EV manufacturer.“General Motors has transformed from an automaker to a platform innovator with scalable architectures designed to accelerate EV adoption across different industries and product types” said Travis Hester GM Vice President ofGrowth Operations.The utilization of GM battery cells will be accompanied by other GM supporting components. The instant high power and torque delivered by the GM propulsion system will enable Volcon UTVs to operate in extreme conditions the outdoors can present.Volcon has taken an extremely cost-effective approach that should be a startup industry model by renting a manufacturing facility versus buying and by utilizing the intellectual property of established players in the EV arena; both contribute to increased focus on design on the base vehicle and the speed to market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMTQvYXV0b21ha2Vycy1pbnZlc3RpbmctaW4tdGhlLXNvdXRoLWFzLWV2cy1jaGFuZ2UtdGhlLWF1dG8taW5kdXN0cnkuaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzA4LzE0L2F1dG9tYWtlcnMtaW52ZXN0aW5nLWluLXRoZS1zb3V0aC1hcy1ldnMtY2hhbmdlLXRoZS1hdXRvLWluZHVzdHJ5Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Motor City is moving south as EVs change the automotive industry,"Jack Weaver an 82-year-old retired dairy farmer whose house sits on a Civil War battlefield lives near General Motors' Spring Hill plant in Tennessee. Michael Wayland / CNBC

SPRING HILL Tenn. – Jack Weaver can point to a cannon on a Civil War battlefield from the comfort of a shaded bench in his backyard — a visible marker of his land's rich past. As he speaks about his small town it's over the loud rumble of cars and trucks at the intersection in front of his farmhouse red home. The 82-year-old retired dairy farmer has lived in Spring Hill nearly his entire life. He's watched the once-quiet town in middle Tennessee grow into a burgeoning Nashville suburb. The evolution of Spring Hill has come in conjunction with a population boom in the state as well as the introduction of new industries — in particular auto companies — that have poured billions of dollars in new investments into the state. ""It's good and it's bad"" says Weaver who complains about cars hitting his fence and the traffic General Motors' Spring Hill plant has brought since it opened in 1990. ""I'm not against development at all. I'm not. I think a man outta do what he wants with his own land."" Detroit is the city that ""put the world on wheels"" but it's towns like Spring Hill and others in neighboring states that are attracting the most investments from automakers in recent years as production priorities shift to a battery-powered future with electric vehicles. Companies more than ever want to build EVs where they sell them because the vehicles are far heavier and more cumbersome to ship than traditional models with internal combustion engines. They also want facilities for battery production to be close by to avoid supply chain and logistics problems. Among the first to invest in southern states was Ford Motor in the 1950s and 1960s in Kentucky followed by foreign-based or transplant automakers starting with Nissan Motor which established a plant in Smyrna Tennessee in 1983. Others such as General Motors  Subaru Toyota Motor and BMW followed suit through the 1990s. More have followed since then including recent announcements by Hyundai Motor and Rivian Automotive to build multibillion-dollar plants in Georgia.

As more companies look to the American South the investments are changing the landscape of towns across the region and of the automotive industry's workforce supply chain and logistics. Companies first to set up shop in the South earn early advantages over their northern competitors and future newcomers according to officials. Auto executives say they're investing in the South for a combination of reasons: lower energy costs available workforce and livability among them. Many southern states also come with other benefits potentially controversial such as all-in lower pay for workers millions in tax breaks and a largely non-unionized workforce in many of the Republican-controlled right-to-work states. But the shift brings unique challenges too. As the Motor City moves and expands south it has to grapple with preservation of historic plantation farms unearthing of slave burial grounds and pushback from citizens and local politicians who aren't used to the traffic or industries.

Investments shifting

Automakers have announced $45.9 billion of investments in southern states since 2017 according to The Center for Automotive Research a nonprofit think tank based in Ann Arbor Michigan. That's the first year the South outpaced the Midwest or Great Lakes region for announced investments since at least 2010. Midwest states such as Michigan Ohio and Indiana saw $39.9 billion in announced investments in that same timeframe. Most of the money heading south – $34.2 billion or 74% – has come in since last year from traditional automakers such as GM Hyundai and Ford Motor as well as EV startup Rivian. Others such as Volkswagen and Nissan continue to invest and expand their operations in the South largely for new electric vehicles. ""We are basically undergoing the single biggest industrial transformation I would say not to understate it in the history of America"" Scott Keogh CEO at Volkswagen of America told CNBC in June at the automaker's new battery lab in Chattanooga Tennessee. ""It's happening right now in this area.""

Keogh singled out energy capacity and costs as the top priority for the company's investments in Tennessee including the potential for new assembly and battery facilities that the company is ""actively"" scouting locations for. He and other executives have also cited incentives tax support labor and workforce training as other key elements. Ford CEO Jim Farley put a similar emphasis on the cost and availability of energy in September announcing an $11.4 billion investment in new vehicle and battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky. ""We want to work with states who are really excited about doing that training and giving you access to that low energy cost"" Farley told the Associated Press then. Tennessee has among the lowest electricity prices in the country according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state's average industrial price of electricity per kilowatt-hour was 6.31 cents as of May. Michigan's industrial energy cost was 8.72 cents per kilowatt-hour and the national average was 8.35 cents. Mississippi and South Carolina were under 7 cents while Georgia was 9.05 cents – among the highest in area according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. While those cost differences seem minimal they add up quickly. Ford's new battery plants will have an annual capacity for 43 megawatt-hours of production. There are 1000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a megawatt-hour meaning tens of thousands of dollars in savings per year. The expansion south is expected to continue for years to come according to AlixPartners. The global consulting firm expects investments from automakers and suppliers in southern states such as Alabama Georgia and Kentucky to total $58 billion for electric vehicles between 2022 and 2026. That's nearly four times the $15 billion that's expected in Midwest states and $20 billion elsewhere in the country. ""It definitely will change but right now there's a lot more interest and activity happening in the Southern states particularly with all these automakers making investments on the EV front"" said Arun Kumar a managing director in the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.

Southern hospitality

State economic development officials from Tennessee and Georgia say their states have made the automotive industry a priority because of the supply chain jobs that typically follow. They also say electric vehicles have helped to level the playing field for new investments. ""This is almost like a seed field of opportunity as this industry changes because we're building the supply chain in the United States for electrification from scratch"" said Pat Wilson commissioner of Georgia's economic development unit. ""There's a huge amount of opportunity."" As of July EV-related projects contributed more than $12.6 billion in investments and more than 17800 new jobs in Georgia since 2020 officials said. Tennessee reports automotive companies have added more than 43800 new jobs and invested $16.5 billion in private capital in the state since 2012 representing nearly 30% of private capital investments during that time.

With billions of dollars on the line and tens of thousands of new jobs states have offered enormous incentive packages for the companies in the forms of land tax abatements/incentives and other support such as installation of utilities and roadways. For example Tennessee approved an $884 million incentive package for Ford's plans to spend $5.6 billion in the state as well as in-kind services and a $2 million grant for training services. Ford's investment includes a new electric truck plant and battery facility with supplier South Korea-based SK Innovation. Bob Rolfe who oversees The Volunteer State's economic development said such actions are needed to compete with others. He said to attract Ford last year the state spent years accumulating enough land for an ""electric vehicle mega site"" ahead of securing the automaker's commitment. ""We tell our team every day to continue to recruit. Is enough enough?"" Lewis said ahead of a trip to Japan for automotive recruitment in June. ""The more great companies that call Tennessee home the softer the landing when we do hit the next wind shear that's going to be developed around the next recession.""

Unique issues

But not all agree that the automotive industry should be expanding South into rural areas. Rivian has faced notable pushback since announcing plans last year to build a $5 billion plant about 45 miles east of Atlanta Georgia. While hailed by many politicians including Gov. Brian Kemp local news outlets report residents of the rural area are concerned with how it will impact their community. Others including politicians oppose a $1.5 billion in tax breaks and other incentives that state and local officials have offered Rivian.

Haynes Haven is a historic landmark in Spring Hill Tennessee that has been maintained by GM since the automaker built an assembly plant near the site in the 1980s.

""[Union Army General] Sherman and his troops destroyed our community. Now this supposedly green company is coming to destroy it again"" JoEllen Artz told NBC News in May. Artz is president of the grassroots No2Rivian group which says it has raised over $250000 and hired Atlanta lawyers to fight the plant. ""We want to keep it just like it is."" Building massive assembly plants in traditionally rural areas can also involve a unique set of challenges. Decades ago when GM was building its Spring Hill plant the company unearthed an unmarked slave graveyard. GM paid for the remains to be moved to a nearby burial site. ""When we invest in properties we're also investing in communities their history and culture"" GM said in an emailed statement to CNBC. ""With any building or renovation project we expect to encounter the unexpected and we try to work with community members to find solutions to fit the unique needs of each situation. In many cases like in Spring Hill the unexpected finds become intertwined in our own history as well."" It wasn't the first time GM has operated around such a site. On the property of its Detroit-Hamtramck plant there's an active Jewish graveyard that the company agreed to build around when it built the plant in the 1980s. There was reportedly another cemetery moved in Smyrna Tennessee – located about 28 miles northeast of Spring Hill – when Nissan's plant and railroads were built there in the early 1980s.

Since GM's Spring Hill Assembly plant was built the company also has maintained two historic plantations as part of land deals struck during the construction. It still maintains one called Haynes Haven whose historic horse stables were turned into a welcome center and used for other events. The surrounding area is currently being used for employee parking during construction of the company's new $2.3 billion battery plant next to the original plant. The other site called Rippavilla sits across the street from the plant and was donated by the company to the city in 2016. It is now being run by a nonprofit organization The Battle of Franklin Trust committed to Civil War preservation and education. ""The last people that owned Rippavilla were pretty insistent that they wanted it to be a historic site. They did not want to happen to what happened to Haynes Haven which Haven is owned by GM and able to use however they see fit"" said Eric Jacobson CEO of the organization. Jacobson credits GM with saving and maintaining the site in the form of $100000 a year up until 2016 when a 10-year deal to maintain the property ended. GM said it continues to support the site.

Battling the union

While the automakers may have to navigate battlefields of the South they don't have to worry as much about battling unions. The United Auto Workers has failed to successfully organize a non-Detroit automaker plant in the South despite decades of attempts. The prominent union also now faces challenges of organizing joint venture battery plants from GM and Ford in the South. ""It's a very critical time for the UAW"" Ray Curry president of the union told CNBC. ""This transformation piece is about our future. It's about 86-plus years of longstanding history.""

Ford's more than $11.4 billion investment to build new U.S. facilities in Tennessee and Kentucky is expected to create nearly 11000 jobs to produce electric vehicles and batteries. Both GM and Ford officials have said the decision of whether to unionize at their U.S. battery plants which are joint ventures will be left to the workers. While the labor cost gap has narrowed between the Detroit automakers and other non-unionized automotive plants organized labor costs are higher for the companies. At the end of a current four-year contract between the Detroit automakers and UAW in 2023 the Center for Automotive Research estimates average hourly labor costs per worker will be $71 for GM; $69 for Ford; and $66 for Stellantis  formerly Fiat Chrysler. ""There's quite a bit of anti-union attitude that prevails in the international carmakers"" said James Rubenstein a professor emeritus at the University of Miami Ohio who specializes in the automotive industry. ""It's a little bit easier to do that down South to keep the union out.""

To offer a digital marketplace to its network of entrepreneurs SEWA has an online bazaar where rural women artisans can sell their products.

Today’s digital revolution is helping reach the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals more quickly. It is also challenging the notion that rural women are waiting passively for help.

The country’s approach was controversial with some calling it “the Swedish experiment”. But almost two-and-a-half years after the pandemic began what can we say today about the outcomes of this “experiment”?

First let’s recap what Sweden’s strategy looked like. The country largely stuck to its pandemic plan originally developed to be used in the event of an influenza pandemic. Instead of lockdowns the goal was to achieve social distancing through public health recommendations.

Swedes were encouraged to work from home if possible and limit travel within the country. In addition people aged 70 or older were asked to limit social contact and people with COVID symptoms were asked to self-isolate. The goal was to protect the elderly and other high-risk groups while slowing down the spread of the virus so the healthcare system wouldn’t become overwhelmed.

As the number of cases surged some restrictions were imposed. Public events were limited to a maximum of 50 people in March 2020 and eight people in November 2020. Visits to nursing homes were banned and upper secondary schools closed. Primary schools did however remain open throughout the pandemic.

Face masks were not recommended for the general public during the first wave and only in certain situations later in the pandemic.

During spring 2020 the reported COVID death rate in Sweden was among the highest in the world. Neighbouring countries that implemented rapid lockdown measures such as Norway and Denmark were faring much better and Sweden received harsh criticism for its lax approach.

But defenders of the Swedish strategy claimed it would pay off in the long run arguing that draconian measures were not sustainable and that the pandemic was a marathon not a sprint.

So did Sweden’s Covid-19 approach pay off?

Let’s look at excess mortality as a key example. This metric takes the total number of deaths and compares this figure with pre-pandemic levels capturing the wider effects of the pandemic and accounting for incorrect reporting of COVID deaths.

Although Sweden was hit hard by the first wave its total excess deaths during the first two years of the pandemic were actually among the lowest in Europe.

The decision to keep primary schools open also paid off. The incidence of severe acute COVID in children has been low and a recent study showed that Swedish children didn’t suffer the learning loss seen in many other countries.

In this light the Swedish strategy has gone from being called “a disaster” and “cautionary tale” to a “Scandinavian success”. But to draw any relevant conclusions it’s crucial we dig a little further into how Swedes navigated the pandemic.

Notably any perceptions that people in Sweden went on with their everyday lives during the pandemic as if nothing had changed are untrue.

In a survey by Sweden’s Public Health Agency from the spring of 2020 more than 80% of Swedes reported they had adjusted their behaviour for example by practising social distancing avoiding crowds and public transport and working from home. Aggregated mobile data confirmed that Swedes reduced their travel and mobility during the pandemic.

Swedes were not forced to take action against the spread of the virus but they did so anyway. This voluntary approach might not have worked everywhere but Sweden has a history of high trust in authorities and people tend to comply with public health recommendations.

It’s also difficult to compare Sweden’s results to those of countries outside of Scandinavia that have very different social and demographic conditions.

Strengths and weaknesses

Despite the benefits of avoiding lockdown the Swedish response was not flawless. In late 2020 the Corona Commission an independent committee appointed by the government to evaluate the Swedish pandemic response found the government and the Public Health Agency had largely failed in their ambition to protect the elderly.

At that time almost 90% of those who had died with COVID in Sweden were 70 or older. Half of these people were living in a care home and just under 30% were receiving home help services.

Indeed numerous problems within elderly care in Sweden became evident during the pandemic. Structural shortcomings such as insufficient staffing levels left nursing homes unprepared and ill-equipped to handle the situation.

In its final report on the pandemic response the Corona Commission concluded that tougher measures should have been taken early in the pandemic such as quarantine for those returning from high-risk areas and a temporary ban on entry to Sweden.

The commission did however state that the no-lockdown strategy was fundamentally reasonable and that the state should never interfere with the rights and freedoms of its citizens more than absolutely necessary. The commission also supported the decision to keep primary schools open.

By comparison the Corona Commission in Norway one of the few countries in Europe with lower excess mortality than Sweden concluded that although the handling of the pandemic in Norway was generally good children were hit hard by lockdowns and the authorities did not adequately protect them.

The focus of Sweden’s strategy was to reduce the spread of the virus but also to consider other aspects of public health and protect freedom and fundamental rights. While the Swedish strategy remains controversial today most countries are taking similar approaches to the continuing pandemic.

Looking back it seems a bit unjust that the country that followed its pre-pandemic plan was the country accused of conducting an experiment on its population. Perhaps Sweden instead should be considered the control group while the rest of the world underwent an experiment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2ExZmIwZGI1LWJlZjYtNGViMS1hMTA4LTg3MjgxNGE2YTkwYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asset managers curb pay amid rising cost pressures,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Michael Young spoke of Ian Kinsler’s passionate belief in the team’s ability even at times when belief was all it had. David Murphy praised Kinsler on his skill of squeezing out every tiny edge he could to create an extra run. Darren Oliver laughed about hating Kinlser when they were opponents.

When Kinsler finally addressed the crowd at Globe Life Field Saturday afternoon as one half of the 2022 Rangers Hall of Fame Class — legendarily hardworking and humble PR man John Blake was the other — a thought crystallized.

The Rangers could use an Ian Kinsler right now.

Always about winning.

“Every great team needs an engine and he was ours” Young said in introducing Kinsler Saturday before the Rangers’ eventual 7-4 win over Seattle that included erasing an early three-run deficit.

“In so many ways he set the tone for us” Young said. “He got us going and we fed off him. We fed off his talent and his personality. Kins knew his part: To be intense create havoc and set a tone of relentlessness. He had a knack of giving us exactly what we needed. He was instinctive confident and fearless. In short he was a winner.”

As the 50th anniversary Rangers wander toward their sixth straight losing season they stopped for a moment to remember their greatest era again. Kinsler became the fourth player to appear on at least one of their two AL championship teams in 2010-11 to be inducted in the last six years. He was at the core of both.

He follows Young the leader; Josh Hamilton the otherworldly talent; and Adrián Beltré who became the heart of the franchise. Kinsler in his own words tried to bring the “grit.”

He is the only member of the quartet who was drafted and developed by the Rangers a 17th-round selection out of Missouri in 2003 who went on to compile the highest WAR (54.3) of any player in that entire draft.

In a 14-year career the first eight of which he spent with the Rangers he had two 30-30 seasons made four All-Star teams won two Gold Gloves went to three World Series and won one. He finished with 1999 hits 257 homers and 243 steals. Only four second basemen have at least 2000 hits 200 homers and 200 steals.

He had a six-hit cycle helped push the Rangers’ over the hump to win a playoff series for the first time in their history and ignited the most complete offense the team has ever had.

But what he brought the organization extended beyond statistics. He embodied the Rangers’ attitude in their best years: They knew they were going to win and they were willing to do whatever it took to accomplish that.

“I took pride in being a catalyst” he said. “I tried to play with contagious energy. The thing I loved to hear most from players was ‘I hated playing against and I loved being your teammate’.”

And while the theme was remembering the past it also was clear that the present Rangers lack that approach.

“I don’t know if we lack it as much as we are still developing it” manager Chris Woodward said Saturday. “We’ve still got a lot of guys trying to figure out how they fit into that and they still have a lot of work to do as far as learning what to look for and how to apply it. I think what a Kinsler in his prime could do for this team would be super beneficial.”

To be fair any team could use an in-his-prime Kinsler for both talent and attitude. The latter seems to be in short supply throughout baseball at the current moment.

But most other teams have found other ways to win. Sunday will mark two full years since the Rangers’ last spent a day over .500. They flirted with the mark for much of June but have sunk since July 1. They began Saturday a season-worst 14 games below .500.

They have some talented players but seem mostly a mélange of parts rather than part of a machine. They function more as individual players than as an organism singularly dedicated to winning. Corey Seager and Marcus Semien their two big free agent investments of the offseason are meticulous in preparation but aren’t likely to challenge teammates. Adolis García is full of confidence and exuberance but hasn’t proved as instinctive as Kinsler.

Maybe Ezequiel Duran Josh Smith Leody Taveras or Bubba Thompson add the Kinsler trait but it’s usually something players arrive with rather than develop at the major league level. Maybe in the short time before he is called up Josh Jung will demonstrate it.

But the game now often seems a talent show rather than a competition.

“If the only thing that mattered was winning the game would processes change” Woodward asked rhetorically but he didn’t have an answer.

Kinsler did. Winning was the only thing that mattered.

It seems like the Rangers could use a little more of that right about now.

The 21-year-old Rodriguez who put on an impressive show in the All-Star Home Run Derby had missed the Mariners' previous 11 games with a wrist injury.

Rodriguez hit a tiebreaking opposite-field single to shallow right with the bases loaded in the fourth inning. He was the first batter to face Jose Leclerc who relieved Taylor Hearn.

Rodriguez hit a grand slam off Leclerc at Globe Life Field on July 15.

""I just felt good'' Rodriguez said. ""I just went out there and competed. I wasn't worried about anything.''

Rodriguez also sent 400-foot shot nearly over the left-field foul pole in the sixth that was ruled foul even after a Seattle challenge.

""I thought it went over'' Rodriguez said. ""They should put [the pole] higher.''

George Kirby (4-3) allowed two runs in 5⅔ innings on seven hits with five strikeouts and one walk. It was the rookie's second straight win.

The victory combined with Toronto's loss to Cleveland gave the Mariners a half-game lead over the Blue Jays.

The Mariners are a season-best 10 games over .500 and are 12-2 with nine consecutive wins this season against the Rangers who dropped to a season-low 14 games under .500.

Yet of those five Servais is the only who hasn’t led his team to the postseason. He hopes to change that in the coming weeks with the Mariners clinging to the top AL Wild Card spot.



“Again the job's not done” Servais said. “We've got a lot of fun baseball ahead of us and I'm looking forward to that.”

“If you look at where our organization has come” Servais said “from a team we inherited to trading off a lot of those guys the rebuild starting over with young players and seeing where we're at today it's a credit to everybody that has been involved with this organization but no more than Jerry and what Justin do on an everyday basis and our ownership group.

ARLINGTON Texas — Praised as the “best possible baseball media relations person in the last 25-plus years” by Texas Rangers owner Ray Davis long-time Rangers executive John Blake was inducted into the Rangers Hall of Fame on Saturday.

Blake now the Rangers’ executive vice-president of public affairs has worked as a baseball public relations professional since joining the Baltimore Orioles in the late 1970s. But he has spent the bulk of his professional career with the Rangers where he has crafted the team’s message and promoted the team’s players including that of Hall of Famers Nolan Ryan Ivan ‘Pudge’ Rodriguez and fellow inductee Ian Kinsler.

Former Rangers general manager and current television analyst Tom Grieve inducted Blake. Grieve will retire from the booth after this season.

Grieve said that baseball has been one of the constants in Blake’s life and praised his hiring back in the 1980s as instrumental to the franchise’s rise out of the doldrums of a losing franchise. He also said that the way that Blake and his staff handled Ryan’s milestone 5000th strikeout in 1989 was one of the reasons Ryan decided to extend his stay in Arlington beyond his intended one season. He played for the Rangers until 1993.

“Back in 1985 the Rangers were a struggling franchise” Grieve said. “(former owner) Eddie Chiles was trying to change that. One of the first things he did was hire John Blake.”

Along with the traditional plaque Blake received a power-blue bat with his name on it. Like the rest of the Hall of Famers he received a blue Rangers Hall of Fame blazer.

Blake was accompanied by his wife and his two kids. He thanked them and the Rangers organization for his induction. He referenced the mural painted on the first-base side of Globe Life Field one that depicts many of the great players and milestones that have happened to the franchise. He said it was fitting that his induction was in the franchise’s 50th season and that he’s honored to have witnessed many of the players and the milestone depicted on that mural.

“It all comes down to relationships and the people I met along the way” Blake said.

There were several video messages for Blake during the ceremony including from Rangers Hall of Famer Charlie Hough former Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus former Rangers manager Ron Washington Ryan former president and former Rangers owner George W. Bush

Blake is in his 44th year in pro baseball. He joined the Rangers as the team’s media relations director. Previously he served as the assistant public relations director and media information director for the Baltimore Orioles from 1979-84.

He served 20 years with the Rangers from 1984-2004 spending part of that time in a concurrent position with the Dallas Stars when the two teams were owned by Tom Hicks. After spending three seasons with the Boston Red Sox from 2006-08 Blake returned as the Rangers’ vice president of media relations.

Blake is already a member of the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame where he was inducted in 1995.

Blake is the fifth front-office executive inducted into the Rangers Hall of Fame. The first was Grieve. After that former team president Tom Schieffer was inducted in 2014 and then Chuck Morgan known to most as the Rangers’ public address announcer but holds the title of executive vice president ballpark entertainment promotions and production.

Ryan who served as the team’s president and CEO from 2008-13 was an inaugural member of the Rangers Hall of Fame from his time as a player from 1989-94.

Other Rangers Hall of Famers in attendance included Jim Sundberg (2003) Ferguson Jenkins (2004) Tom Grieve (2010) Eric Nadel (2012) Ivan ‘Pudge’ Rodriguez (2013) Tom Schieffer (2014) Michael Young (2016) former Arlington Mayor Richard Greene (2019) Adrian Beltre (2021) Chuck Morgan (2021) and Victor Vandergriff the son of former Arlington Mayor Tom Vandergriff (2004). Vandergriff is credited with helping to lure the former Washington Senators to Arlington before the 1972 season.

Other former Rangers in attendance were Frank Catalanotto Chris Davis Craig Gentry Colby Lewis Doug Melvin and David Murphy.

GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdGhldmlsbGFnZXN1bi5jb20vbmV3LXlvcmstdGltZXMtZW5kb3JzZXMtdHJ1bXAtc2NvdXJnZS1kYW4tZ29sZG1hbi1mb3ItY29uZ3Jlc3MtaW4tMTB0aC1kaXN0cmljdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Times endorses 'Trump scourge' Dan Goldman for Congress in 10th District,"“Mr. Goldman a former federal prosecutor has lived in Lower Manhattan for 16 years” the editorial stated. “His uncommon experience particularly his knowledge of congressional oversight and the rule of law could prove especially valuable in Congress in coming years.”

The editorial board cited its interview with Goldman in which he stated “’I have been on the front lines leading the fight in Congress against Donald Trump and his Republican Party and trying to protect and defend our democracy and our institutions and our rule of law.'”

(Last month as reported by The Village Sun Goldman released a “A Five-Point Plan To Defend Our Democracy.” The scheme calls for abolishing the Electoral College establishing term limits for U.S. Supreme Court justices and suspending the statute of limitations on offenses committed by presidents and vice presidents before or during their time in office.)

The Times endorsement added that “thanks to his work on the impeachment trial” Goldman already has close working relationships in Washington.

Despite an eyebrow-raising statement by Goldman to Hamodia on abortion about which he later said he “misspoke” the Times assured that he “made clear he will passionately defend” abortion rights.

Goldman’s experience in law enforcement as a former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York would be helpful too if he wins election toward ensuring public safety the paper said.

Addressing his personal wealth as an heir to the Levi Strauss jeans empire — which his opponnets have tried to make an issue out of — the Times noted that Goldman supports a ban on stock trading by congressmembers and has pledged to put his assets into a blind trust if elected.

Nevertheless Goldman if elected would definitely need to work to show he can represent everyone in the diverse NY-10 the Times said.

“Although he lives in the district much of which is affluent” the editorial stated “Mr. Goldman would need to use his first term to convince the large numbers of lower-income and middle-class Americans he would represent that he understands the issues facing those constituents especially the need for more affordable housing and better public transportation.”

As for Jones the Times’s runner-up for the seat the editorial praised him as “a bridge builder between the progressive wing of his party and its more moderate leadership” adding that he has been “a prolific legislator particularly on voting rights.”

At the same time the Times conceded that neither Goldman nor Jones “have as much experience working in the communities they seek to represent as other candidates in the race.”

On that note the Gray Lady did give a shout-out to former Congressmember Elizabeth Holtzman — who represented part of the district in the 1970s and ’80s — recalling she played a key role during the investigation of Richard Nixon. Holtzman “made a similar — and compelling — case” for her candidacy in describing how like Goldman she would be a democracy defender the paper said yet adding that the district “is ready for new representation.”

Hank Sheinkopf the veteran political strategist called the Times’s endorsement very important in this particular election — and yet he strongly critiqued it too.

On the one hand he said the influential outlet’s endorsement “sorts out the chaos” in the race given how many candidates are running.

The editorial also has an abnormally high impact in this case because of the primary’s unusal date — Aug. 23 — so “It’s a wake-up call” to voters that the election is actually happening he said.

Sheinkopf conceded that Goldman has “spent his money wisely” and run a good campaign: “He created a persona that didn’t exist” he said.

The fact that the attorney has also gotten airtime on MSNBC as a talking head during the Jan. 6 hearings “is a form of free advertising” Sheinkopf noted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvYW5zaHUtamFpbi1kaWVk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anshu Jain: The bank CEO who turned his phone off on holiday,"Anshu Jain the former CEO of Deutsche Bank who has died of cancer aged just 59 had plenty of reasons to be well-liked.

Under his leadership Deutsche didn't just pay well it paid extravagantly. Jain himself reportedly earned up to $30m a year in the peak years of the late 1990s and early 2000s; Deutsche Bank traders routinely earned $10m-$20m a year. Some earned even more: Christian Bittar a 36 year-old French rates trader who was one of Jain's favourites earned $140m for a single year shortly before the financial crisis (and before he was subsequently jailed for manipulating euribor). Under Jain Deutsche's traders were paid and praised; in 2007 he flew the Rolling Stones in to play for them at a concert in Barcelona.

But it's not for his generosity that Jain is being lauded today: it's for his character. Despite being one of the best paid bankers of a generation Jain is celebrated as a humble intellectual aesthete - who also really really wanted to win.

James Davies the current head of Deutsche's investment bank for the Americas says he first met Anshu playing cricket where Jain was knocked to the ground by a ""first ball bouncer"" only to stand up and face the next ball. ""The qualities he showed on the pitch - leadership courage loyalty and a fierce desire to win were the hallmarks of his attitude on the trading floor"" says Davies.

Garth Ritchie the former head of Deutsche's investment bank says Jain will be remembered for his ""intellect & competitive nature"" and that he's grateful for all the ""teaching the coaching"" and the ""gimme putts"" that Jain gave him.

Although Jain liked earning money as a marker of a success he didn't fit the stereotype of the lavish-spending banker. He lived in a ""comparatively modest"" house in West London while he was at DB and was born into the ascetic Jain religion. He didn't eat meat or animal products. He loved wildlife and wildlife photography. His father seems to have been similar: Anshu reportedly bought his father a BMW and paid a driver but his father didn't use them and bought himself a Tata Nano instead.

While Jain could be intensely competitive (and often set-up people competing for the same role at Deutsche Bank) friends of Anshu testify to his kindness humanity and generosity. One says he helped his wife when she fell ill in 2018 and shared all the research and contacts he'd made during his own struggle with cancer.

Jain left Deutsche Bank in 2015 and became president of Cantor Fitzgerald in 2017 the same year he was diagnosed with cancer. Despite his illness he continued appearing at public events speaking at the World Economic Forum in 2020. When his cancer was diagnosed in January 2017 he was given a year to live but his family said he outlasted this “through a combination of exhaustive personal research tactical skill amazing caregivers and sheer force of will.”

Yet Jain knew how to relax too. Andrew Kent the former European head of equity index volatility trading says that Anshu told him he always turned his phone off when he was on holiday on safari so that he could enjoy time with his family.

Anshu is survived by his wife and two children Aranya and Arjun. Arjun works in venture capital after starting his career in JPMorgan. Aranya works in publishing after a year in cross asset sales at Goldman Sachs.

Richard Sharp was an early investor in Atomyze a Swiss blockchain business established by the oligarch Vladimir Potanin. Also known as the “Nickel King” Potanin has played ice hockey with Vladimir Putin and was one of the oligarchs summoned to the Kremlin when Russia invaded Ukraine.

Potanin was hit with sanctions by the UK government in June as part of a crackdown on “Putin’s inner circle”. The Foreign Office said the oligarch – once considered Russia’s richest man – was targeted because he “continues to amass wealth as he supports Putin’s regime”.

It is unclear how the Russian ended up in business with Sharp a former Goldman Sachs banker and Conservative party donor who was appointed as chair of the BBC by Boris Johnson’s government.

Sharp’s previously unreported investment in the oligarch’s Atomyze crypto business was made in 2019 through a Cayman Islands company called ABCP GP Ltd. The Cayman Islands are an offshore tax haven known for publishing limited financial documents on who owns businesses.

Atomyze uses blockchain technology to trade commodities especially metals produced by Potanin’s Nornickel company which dominates the global market for nickel.

The future BBC chair subsequently became a company director of Atomyze for two months. Although Sharp has since stepped down from this role Swiss corporate filings show an individual who works for Sharp’s personal investment office continues to sit on the board of directors.

There is no suggestion Sharp has breached any of the recently introduced UK government sanctions which would prevent ongoing financial dealings with Potanin or his businesses.

Sharp was appointed BBC chair after previously giving hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Conservative party. His lengthy career in the City of London included a successful stint as a Goldman Sachs banker – where a young Rishi Sunak worked for him – before he moved into private investments and took senior roles in the British arts scene.

His personal wealth is such that he donates his £160000-a-year salary for the part-time BBC job to charity.

Sharp along with the BBC director general Tim Davie and a number of prominent BBC journalists has been banned by the Russian government from travelling to the country since the invasion of Ukraine due to the British broadcaster’s coverage of the conflict.

A spokesperson for Sharp’s investment trust said he had “a longstanding interest in a range of emerging technology companies”. They emphasised that no sanctions had been imposed on Potanin when Sharp invested in the oligarch’s company which is regulated by the Swiss authorities.

The spokesperson said Sharp put his investments in a blind trust – an arrangement where financial assets are managed by a third party to avoid conflicts of interests – in May 2020 after being hired as a Treasury adviser by the then chancellor Sunak.

They added: “The arrangement was maintained after Sharp became chairman of the BBC. This blind trust has professionally managed the ABCP GP Ltd and Atomyze Switzerland interests with complete independence from Mr Sharp and at the trust’s sole discretion since its establishment.

“At the current time the blind trust and therefore Mr Sharp have no financial or directorial interests in any businesses owned and controlled by Mr Potanin.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9jZWxzaXVzLW5ldHdvcmstaXMtYmFua3J1cHQtc28td2h5LWlzLWNlbC1wcmljZS1pcy11cC00LTAwMC1pbi10d28tbW9udGhz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celsius Network is bankrupt so why is CEL price up 4000% in two months?,"Crypto lending platform Celsius Network has an approximately $1.2 billion gap in its balance sheet with most liabilities owed to its users. In addition the firm has filed for bankruptcy protection so its future looks bleak.

Still Celsius Network’s native utility token CEL has soared in valuation by over 4100% in the last two months reaching around $3.93 on Aug. 13 compared to its mid-June bottom of $0.093.

In comparison top coins Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) rallied 40% and 130% in the same period.

Takeover rumors behind CEL explosion?

Technically the price rally made CEL an excessively valued token in early August when its relative strength index (RSI) crossed above the 70 thresholds.

Takeover rumors appear to be behind CEL’s upside strength. Notably Ripple wants to purchase Celsius Network’s assets according to an anonymous source cited by Reuters on Aug. 10.

Reuters reported that Ripple is interested in Celsius assets but there's no confirmation yet from either companies. Celsius has halted withdrawals from the platform since June and has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy which will enable them gradually payback what they owe. — Tajo Crypto (@TajoCrypto) August 10 2022

CEL’s price more than doubled after the piece of news hit the wire.

In July rumors also surfaced about Goldman Sachs’ intention to acquire Celsius Network for $2 billion. CEL was changing hands for as low as $0.39 around that time.

CEL price short squeeze

An army of retail traders also appears to be behind the CEL’s giant upside push in the last two months.

Some traders have organized a short squeeze to limit CEL’s downside prospects. A short squeeze is when an asset’s price rises suddenly forcing short sellers to buy back the asset at a higher price to close their positions.

Bitcoin & Celsius Update



BTC is very choppy so my focus is on altcoins & CEL. I'd like btc to hold 22k for bullish bias. Cel wants breakout again Iam looking to buy more above 2.6 with #CELShortSqueeze army behind it could CEL pump to $3 next?



LIKES/RETWEETS APPRECIATED pic.twitter.com/5axZiwcl1Q — WSB Crypto Mod (@traderrocko) August 12 2022

It is possible to create a short squeeze because of CEL’s lowering circulating supply primarily due to the freeze on Celsius Network’s token transfers.

Interestingly FTX had about 5.1 million CEL tokens on Aug. 13 approximately 90% of all the total circulation across exchanges. Meanwhile the amount of open short positions on the exchange was around 2.66 million CEL versus the monthly high of 2.96 million CEL on Aug. 11.

In other words short traders have closed about 300000 CEL positions in just two days.

What's next for Celsius toke?

Short squeezes are hard to sustain over a long period history shows.

Such prospects put CEL at risks of facing extreme correction in the coming weeks or months. As said the token is already overbought which further adds up to the downside outlook.

CEL/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView

Drawing a Fibonacci retracement graph from $6.50-swing high to $0.39-swing low churns out interim support and resistance levels for CEL. Notably the token now eyes a breakout above its 0.618 Fib line at around $4.21 with its upside target at $5.25 up 45% from the price on August 13.

Conversely a break below the support level at the 0.5 Fib line at around $3.48 risks crashing CEL toward $2.75 down 25% from the current price level.

Sky News has learnt that Lithia Motors which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange tabled a 29p-per-share bid valuing Pendragon at about £460m.

City sources said on Friday that Lithia was being advised on its interest by Goldman Sachs.

Pendragon disclosed in a stock exchange announcement last week that ""a large international corporate"" had presented a board-approved non-binding cash offer for it.

The approach failed to progress further because one of the British company's five largest shareholders would not provide an irrevocable undertaking to accept it.

Insiders said the investor in question was Hedin Group which itself made a 28p-per-share offer for Pendragon earlier this year.

Leading shareholders said they were unlikely to accept any bid unless it was worth more than 30p-per-share.

The talks with Lithia have been terminated as a result of Hedin's refusal to engage with the offer.

Hedin which owns roughly 25pc of Pendragon has been a vocal critic of its board in recent years particularly on executive pay.

Like many of its rivals Pendragon received tens of millions of pounds in furlough payments from the government during the pandemic.

The company has seen its shares rise by nearly one-third over the last 12 months although on Friday they were trading at 24.7p a meaningful discount to the Lithia bid.

The company operates more than 150 dealerships across the UK under the brands Evans Halshaw Stratstone and CarStore.

Hedin Group's interest this year in a takeover of its British rival raised the intriguing prospect of a return to Pendragon for Trevor Finn the company's founder who was ousted in 2019.

Mr Finn joined Hedin's board last year.

The latest bid approach for Pendragon comes during a time of significant changes in the way new and used cars are sold and a frenzy of corporate activity among the companies which sell them.

In January Constellation Automotive the privately owned group behind WeBuyAnyCar and Cinch bought almost 20pc of the listed dealer group Lookers.

That swoop came soon after Constellation which has a multibillion pound valuation agreed a £200m takeover of Marshall Motor Group another physical car dealer.

Pendragon itself made an approach to buy Lookers its embattled rival at the height of the pandemic but was rebuffed.

In recent years the industry has shifted its focus to the use of technology to improve the car-buying experience with both Cinch and its New York-listed rival Cazoo ploughing tens of millions of pounds into brand-building through sports sponsorship deals.

Pendragon has cut 1800 jobs since the start of the pandemic and closed 15 stores.

Last December it relaunched CarStore its standalone used-car brand with a mix of physical locations and a digital platform.

Pendragon declined to comment while Lithia could not be reached for comment."

I reached out to see if she'd be willing to sit for an interview about how she spec'd her C8 and she was gracious enough to give our man Duncan Brady some time. When she took delivery of her C8 she quickly became a legend in the Corvette community—by getting pulled over only 3 miles from the dealership immediately boosting the C8 with a nitrous oxide system and then taking it drag racing only a couple of days later. Break in period? What's that?

She subsequently added a twin-turbo kit to her car and in less than a year and proceeded to set the ¼-mile world record for the new C8 Corvette with a 9.418-second pass at 144.84 miles per hour.

All of this hard work and addictive storytelling not only helped grow her social following it caused many companies large and small to take notice. How could they not?

At the time we talked Ms. Emelia had amassed some 3.3 million followers across YouTube Instagram Facebook TikTok and Twitter.

General Motors noticed Emelia's enthusiastic approach and devoted audience and had its Corvette and GMC brands reach out for her help in teasing the Corvette Z06 and launching the Hummer EV as well.

But sports cars and sponsored posts are not all Ms. Hartford is into; she has a full stable of drool worthy high-performance vehicles everything from a 500-hp drift-spec 1993 Nissan 240SX (S13) with a GT-R engine to a 1978 Buick Regal she got from her grandmother that now makes 900 horsepower. Her latest obsession? A Ferrari 458 she's had the audacity to wide-body and bottle feed (for the unhip that means adding nitrous oxide).

As if that's not enough—cars are arguably Ms. Emelia's side hustle. Like many in and around Los Angeles what she really wants to do is be an actor—and she's had great success there as you can see from her burgeoning IMDB page.

In our conversation for The InEVitable we go deep into all of the above from her love of acting that got her into cars and how that hobby turned into an obsession that spawned her vast social media empire. We go one by one through her fleet of wicked tuner and crazy daily drivers (you'll dig what she did to her Prius) and then ask how the future of automotive EVs and tuning fit in and whether they intersect at all with her and her generation of car crazy enthusiasts.

It's one of the best conversations we have had yet and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. You can watch the vodcast right here or on our YouTube channel.

By Ronni Newton

West Hartford Fury was a runner-up in 2021 but in 2022 the team was crowned champions of the Northern Connecticut Girls Softball League.

“These girls have been together for four-plus years and had an unbelievable season” said coach Sarah Hoisl a 2016 Conard High School graduate who was a two-year captain of the school’s softball team and went on to play softball at Emmanuel College.

“They are a hard-working team who care a lot about each other and after losing in the championship last year they came back this year ready to win it all” Hoisl said.

The Fury a 15U travel team ended the season 11-1. They won the championship game 14-7 on Thursday night in what Hoisl said was a very tough contest ultimately defeating another West Hartford 15U team. For the regular season the Fury had a record of 9-1.

In addition to Hoisl Marcel Diaz coached the team. Players were Ella Pesce Nory McDonald Isabella Mangini Matti Ford Keyara Craig Arissa Hanner Audrey Alerte Alice Araya Zoey Canning Rachel Mathews Megan Panarella Jelitza Santiago Teà Higgins Celine Diaz.

Santiago pitched every inning of the season and Mangini was catcher for every inning as well Hoisl said.

Team members attend multiple local schools including Hall Conard Northwest Catholic Classical Magnet Saint Tim’s Sedgwick and Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts.

Credit(s): Modian.com Modian.com is carrying out a crowdfunding initiative for a series of Transformers themed blind boxes made by Beijing Model Hall and licensed by Hasbro. These are for the Chinse market and will be made available if the goal is met. As with many blind boxes there are some chase figures like that Beast Wars Megatron. The theme here is that these are baby versions of these iconic characters. They specifically call them ""kindergarten style"" though by western standards these are closer to a Muppet babies version of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee who actually has a diaper. Even though these will be very limited in terms of the market it is still fun to see the designs so we wanted to share these images with you.

Long ago in the letters page of the good ol' Marvel US book a fan proposed the concept of ""Transformer Babies"" and whoever was answering at the time replied that it was so bold and fresh that it'd never see print.



3 decades later it can be seen in plastic.



Dammit I'm going to end up buying every last one and giving duplicates to kids of friends of relatives. Elita 1 holding a toy of Op's truck mode especially evokes Piggy's fixation on Kermie in Muppet Babies which I will always hold up as the greatest Saturday morning cartoon of all time.

Owners Linda and Clayton Owens had operated the produce stand at U.S. 41/North Williams Street and Southwest 111th Place for the past nine years until they were told in June that the property had been sold and they needed to vacate immediately.

After more than a month-long hiatus and multiple plans changed Linda Owens has good news.

“WE ARE GOING HOME” she recently wrote on Owens Produce’s Facebook page.

In an increasingly rare showing of corporate and local collaboration HCA Healthcare which purchased the land welcomed the produce stand back on site while it is in the early stages of developing the property.

“They had no idea that we had been on the property as a tenant and wanted to make it right” Owens told the Star-Banner.

HCA bought 6.64 acres for $3.8 million

The Nashville-based health care company which has more than 450 care sites throughout Florida – including HCA Florida West Marion Hospital and HCA Florida Ocala Hospital – bought the land for $3.8 million from Hernando-based SREE NSNK HOLDINGS LLC on June 17.

The 6.64-acre property is across the street from the Walmart Supercenter and just north of the Aldi plaza in Dunnellon.

“The purchase is for future development based on community needs” HCA Florida Ocala Hospital Director of Communications and Community Engagement Kaitlyn Butler had written in an email.

Owens Produce had not been told who purchased the property and the community rallied around the local business to offer support and suggestions of new locations.

They planned to move onto the site of American Legion Post 58 on Aug. 4 but ran into a few problems and Owens reached out to Butler at HCA after learning who the buyer was. She quickly got in touch with HCA’s corporate real estate official and praised how responsive kind and helpful they were.

“I just wanted some kind of closure” Owens said. “I didn't want to always wonder: ‘Well could we have gone back if we had just reached out to them?’ ""

HCA offered the spot back and Owens Produce accepted.

“When we heard about Owens Produce and their needs we wanted to do the right thing and work with them to stay in their location knowing we wouldn't be in development for some time” HCA Florida Ocala CEO Chad Christianson said in a statement to the Star-Banner. “We are looking forward to bringing additional vital healthcare services to Marion County in the near future. In the meantime we are glad to partner with a local business and a family that has made a positive impact on this community.”

Loyal produce stand customers elated at news

While some produce stand customers initially planned to oppose whatever entity purchased the property Owens has encouraged positivity and there was a change of heart for many when they learned that HCA had not known about Owens Produce and that it offered the location back.

“God Bless HCA for understanding small towns they are moving into!!” one Facebook commenter wrote. “Welcome back home to our dear friends at Owens Produce and our new friends at HCA Healthcare!”

“That’s wonderful news!” another said. “High praise to HCA for making things right once they understood the situation.”

Owens herself said she was somewhat relieved to find out the new owner would likely bring a medical facility to the Dunnellon area.

Some followers also suggested HCA let the produce stand stay permanently as a counterpart to their health-focused business but Owens said they have not discussed that possibility.

“We don't know how long term it's going to be but it's just the best thing right now for us” Owens said adding that HCA agreed to give them 90 days notice to vacate when the time comes.

The produce stand will open back up at full capacity at 20145 SW 111th Place on Wednesday Aug. 17 at 9 a.m. They will be open 9 a.m. to 5:30 pm. Wednesdays through Saturdays and 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

While Dunnellon has a population of around 2000 according to 2020 Census data Owens Produce has garnered support from a wider range.

The produce stand has over 3000 Facebook followers and has accumulated hundreds of likes and comments on some of its posts updating the community about the journey as well as plenty of phone calls.

“Everybody's been real supportive and they're just happy that we're going to be back where we were” Owens said. “We just love our customers. We just have the best customers and we just appreciate everybody so much and their patience too.”

Although it's never great to get stranded abroad at an airport the good news is that there are four convenient lodging options within walking distance of the airport's Terminal 1 from which Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners as well as some other major carriers fly.

Marriott Bonvoy members can choose from either the Frankfurt Airport Marriott or the Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel and Conference Center while those with Hilton Honors accounts might look toward the Hilton Frankfurt Airport or the Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport. All four are solid choices but we wondered how they stacked up against each other.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

To answer that question we spent a night hotel hopping among the four of them. Here's who each of these four hotels will be best for — and what you can expect at each one.

The Marriott match-up

First up our take on Marriott Bonvoy's conjoined hotels just across from the airport's Terminal 1.

Frankfurt Airport Marriott Hotel

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

Best for: Tired travelers willing to spend more for a cushy stay without a long journey between Terminal 1 and a bed.

Location: Frankfurt Airport Terminal 1. Simply take an escalator up from the departures level walk across an enclosed pedestrian bridge and make a right into the shared entrance of the Marriott and the Sheraton then veer off to the left toward the Marriott's lobby. The time from hotel to terminal? A mere two minutes.

The price point: At 170 euros ($173) for a one-night Deluxe King room stay in the first week of June the price was well worth the experience. Award nights through Marriott's Bonvoy loyalty program will cost 31000-41000 points apiece depending on the date.

The vibe: The lobby was beautiful and had a chic and classy vibe compared to the hectic hallways of Frankfurt Airport. The warm neutrals and mixture of suede leather and wood materials presented a comfy — and somewhat sexy — respite from the hustle and bustle of travel. The sitting area looked like the living room of a well-off Manhattanite who had just a little bit too much money to spend on furniture.

The dining area felt fresh and even worthy of an Instagram post thanks to the sophisticated contrast of the green leather seating and the yellow glassware the brass fixtures and the airiness of the skylit space. Just beware the mid-morning rush when large groups of travelers tend to clog the area waiting to check out.

It truly felt like a little haven away from the chaos of travel which we all know too well. Though the hotel shares some common public areas with the Sheraton around the corner it still felt individualistic and approachable and the staff was accommodating enough to enable an early check-in.

The rooms: The decor was straightforward but with little quirks like quotes by Goethe (a Frankfurt native) on the walls and the industrial nature of the design felt like a deliberate allusion to the nearby airport. A decent-size desk was excellent for getting some work done during a layover and the in-room Krups espresso machine with complimentary coffee pods and accompaniments can be a jetlag-busting lifesaver.

The gray-tiled bathroom lay somewhere between institutional and oasis-like with a basin-style sink a backlit vanity and half-glassed-in shower whose steady water pressure made sudsing up with the provided thisworks products a refreshing experience.

Drinking and dining: The hotel's public amenities many of which are shared with the adjacent Sheraton felt upscale and private providing a nice respite from the crowds circulating throughout the busy airport. The Eatery Kitchen and Bar which connects the Marriott with the Sheraton is open for lunch and dinner and is centered around a bright atrium with plenty of counter and restaurant-style seating to either side of the central bar. At one end there was a Starbucks outlet for caffeine on the go though the restaurant serves food and drinks throughout the day and evening including fresh items like Caesar salad with grilled chicken ($26) pan-fried hake with Dijon sauce ($31) and a Marriott signature burger ($25).

Guests can partake of breakfast at the Sheraton including a copious selection of rolls assorted sausages and a crowd favorite chocolate museli though expect a hefty bill of 32 euros ($33) per person if you don't get free breakfast through elite status.

Overall: The lobby was chic the service was spot on and the food options were varied and fresh especially after a decent amount of travel and eating on the go. The room decor was more playful than you might expect and though the hotel was more expensive than the Sheraton the upsell is well worth it.

Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel & Conference Center

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

Best for: More budget-minded Bonvoy loyalists looking for a better-priced but just as convenient option as the Marriott.

Location: You can access the hotel from Terminal 1 the same way you get to the Marriott only head right instead of left to get to its lobby.

The price point: We paid 149 euros ($152) for a one-night stay in early June in a standard king room. (Cash rates are now considerably higher though that might be the summer rush.) Points redemptions range from 22000 to 30000 points per night for a standard room in the next few months.

The vibe: Despite a new and attractive lobby this large hotel — it was originally 1008 rooms before the Marriott was carved out of it in 2020 — has guestrooms and hallways that are drab (but certainly functional). The maze of corridors were dimly lit and spartan with the exception of room number signs featuring an airplane motif — an obvious reminder that yes you are staying at an airport hotel.

This hotel shares common areas a fitness center and a restaurant with the Marriott. It's an example of some brand synergy in the Marriott portfolio that was made possible by the company's 2016 acquisition of Starwood — of which Sheraton was a part.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 9 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The rooms: Standard rooms live up to that categorization measuring approximately 291 square feet with standard if quickly aging accouterments like king-size beds with blonde wood frames woven fabric headboards and well-worn white linens. Business travelers can get some work done at awkwardly placed (yet well-powered) elliptical wooden desks and stay ahead of jetlag thanks to the provided tea and coffee supplies (no espresso machines here). The wall-mounted televisions have streaming capabilities. Sparse by comparison the almost clinical (and glaringly lit) bathrooms wouldn't look out of place in a hospital ward and have hard-to-navigate shower-tub combos though the (somewhat confusing) mix of Le Grand Bain and Acca Kappa bath products are an overall plus.

Dining and drinking: The Sheraton shares a lobby with the Marriott along with the Eatery. Its signature burger is a sizzling patty placed on a tasty sourdough roll with a bowl of crispy fries. Though tempting the berry tarte flambee ($14) looks more like a berry-topped pizza than the Alsatian delight it's meant to be.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

Overall: The Sheraton tends to be priced much lower than the Marriott -- often 100 euros ($101) less per night -- but shares the same location and amenities. If you can forgo a newer fresher room then this hotel is a great value.

The Hilton head-to-head

Next up we checked into Hilton's sibling properties at the Squaire a dramatic spaceship-like office building with a few shops and restaurants that is connected to the airport and its train station via an indoor walkway.

Hilton Frankfurt Airport

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

Best for: Hilton Honors members who don't mind spending 10 more minutes walking to the airport along with spending a few extra euros on a slightly elevated hotel experience

Location: The Hilton Frankfurt Airport is located in the architecturally singular Squaire Germany's largest office building which itself is built on top of the Frankfurt Airport's long-distance train station. It's about a 10-minute walk from Terminal 1 and about a five-minute walk past the entrance to the Marriott and Sheraton via the enclosed pedestrian bridge that connects the airport and the train station. There are a few more escalators and turns to navigate but great signage makes it easy to get between the hotel and airport. The building has a mall-like atmosphere with some stores and restaurants. A Burger King and Starbucks are located right outside the hotel entrance with a Rossmann drugstore nearby for purchasing any needed travel essentials.

(Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy)

The price point: Rates in early June were 161 euros ($164) for a one-night stay in a standard queen room. (Cash rates are now considerably higher.) At check-in an upgrade to a standard king room was offered for just 5 euros ($5.09). This hotel participates in the Hilton Honors program with award stays that range from 32000 to 70000 points per night for a standard room in the coming months.

The vibe: The architecturally interesting lobby almost feels like something out of a futuristic science fiction movie. It's also a bit sterile: The airy open space could use a bit more furniture and lacked much seating. The lobby bar was closed during our stay in early June and was only used for a few hours each evening to host the hotel's evening reception for elite Hilton Honors members. Re-opening that bar might work wonders for livening up the lobby.

In contrast to the two Bonvoy properties this hotel never felt particularly crowded despite being located so close to one of Europe's busiest airports. One big downside to the design is that the stunning glass-enclosed lobby isn't air conditioned which creates a greenhouse effect — making it very hot in the late spring afternoon sun.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 12 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

The rooms: Rooms are bright and large if slightly impersonal with neutral-toned woods and upholstery — though the boldly patterned carpeting and bright red modernistic wingback chairs provide a little character. The large glass desks feel outdated at this point but provided plenty of room to work with a flatscreen TV mounted right above. Bathrooms are spacious and include both a soaking tub with tiled backsplash and a separate walk-in shower stocked with fragrant Crabtree & Evelyn products. Sizable closets well-stocked minibars and easy-to-use hot water kettles with instant coffee complete the business traveler's trifecta of in-room amenities. My exterior-facing room had a view of the autobahn and ironically the Sheraton.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 8 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Drinking and dining: The hotel's main eatery is Rise restaurant located near the massive lobby. At the time of our stay Rise had limited hours and offered different buffets throughout the day. The 34 euro ($35) breakfast buffet was both expensive and extensive — a good value for those with Hilton Gold status and above who receive a food and beverage credit as part of their elite perks and a pricey splurge for everyone else. The buffet's vast selection of breakfast breads cold cuts pancakes sausages and yogurts should have options for every appetite. However more budget-conscious travelers might want to skip this indulgence and grab a much less expensive breakfast sandwich at the Burger King or one of the other grab-and-go establishments nearby.

Overall: Aside from its singular setting there's not much to distinguish the Hilton Frankfurt Airport from a Hilton anywhere else in the world. The decor is somewhat bland and the in-room amenities are fine if unremarkable. That said this could be a decent use of points when room rates soar during busy times of year and a bargain at other times.

Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

Best for: Thrifty travelers who want to earn or burn Hilton points at an affordable rate.

Location: Follow the directions above for Hilton Frankfurt Airport but turn left immediately before entering the lobby of the Hilton.

The price point: The rate for a queen room was 151 euros ($154) with a Hilton Honors discount or 27000-50000 points per night which is not expensive but perhaps not merited by the amenities and accommodations on offer. The general atmosphere felt aloof and the color combinations of bright green accents with red and brown sprinkled throughout come off as both generic and odd. It made the design feel like an afterthought which also made the hotel feel impersonal. This is definitely a pass-through hotel but if you only need it for a quick stay then maybe it's the winner.

The vibe: Small and stark the lobby had a few squared-off sofas for lounging by the no-nonsense check-in desks but did not feel like a place to hang out. The hotel does deserve a plus for glass elevators that whisk you up to guest rooms through the central atrium.

The rooms: Rooms feel slightly smaller and more basic than at the next-door Hilton. The office chairs felt like Staples castoffs while solid wooden desks and bed frames aren't quite offset by the dim accent lighting. The bathrooms are more compact than at the Hilton with shower-tub combinations rather than separate installations (though you can still enjoy the same Crabtree & Evelyn products). Fancy a preflight cup of coffee? You'll find the same instant coffee kettle setup as at the Hilton.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

Drinking and dining: The Restaurant is closed at the moment for lunch and dinner (this is described as all-day dining on its website but with its hours listed as 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.). You can visit it for breakfast when it offers an American buffet for 25 euros ($26). There are also paid grab-and-go options from the Pavillion Pantry which offers a selection of snacks and sweet treats. Hilton Garden Inn guests also can venture over to the neighboring Hilton to eat according to a front desk manager.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

Overall: If you just need a quick rest before or between flights and don't care about other amenities the Hilton Garden Inn Frankfut Airport is just fine. However if you're going to spend any time in your room or want a convenient on-site restaurant (without having to venture out into the Squaire) then you'll probably be better off at the Hilton.

Checking out

If you're traveling through Frankfurt Airport you certainly have some solid hotel options in case you get stuck there unexpectedly.

The Frankfurt Airport Marriott has an unbeatable location and is the newest of the hotels; a beautiful spotless property with a thoughtful design.

The Hilton Frankfurt Airport is a farther walk from the terminal but also a winner with nice-enough design and highly functional rooms. Food and beverage options at this property are pricey and limited but many other options abound just outside the front door.

The third full-service property the Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel & Conference Center is co-located with the Marriott and also is very convenient though its dark dated design and sterile bathrooms leave a bit to be desired.

Finally budget-conscious travelers should be satisfied with the Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport which is at a lower price point than its full-service neighbors but does not sacrifice the convenience.

If you end up staying at one of these properties we sure hope you're there willingly and not because an airline meltdown sent you there. But in any case we're glad to report that you shouldn't have a problem enjoying a decent stay at any of them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbnRoYWlsYW5kLmNvbS9wci1uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL3ByLW5ld3MvNDAwMTg4ODXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Hilton has announced enhancements to their ESG strategy ""Travel with Purpose""","Its updated 2030 benchmarks include stronger more ambitious greenhouse gas emissions targets which were re-validated by the Science Based Targets Initiatives (SBTi) to adapt to evolving climate science and best practices and align with targets set during the 2015 Paris Climate Accords.

Even one of the highlights of brand investment he cites Disney has been diluting the brand by removing experiences from accessible price points. But Disney is one of the good ones. It’s the Marriotts and Hiltons of the world that are especially problematic.

Hotel chains and hotel owners have different incentives. A hotel chain benefits from a strong brand. That attracts guests which they can deliver to hotels. It attracts a revenue premium as well. And it serves as a short-hand a guest can use to know what they’re getting in terms of experience for their money.

A hotel owner though is happy to pay for the guest to stay at their property. But outside of repeat business once the hotel owner has got the reservation their incentive is to spend as little money as possible servicing the guest or – in some cases – even maintaining the property (though this can affect resale value).

If a chain enforces brand standards and fines hotels that do not live up to them they can align incentives.

The brand standards are upheld



So guests staying at a brand trust that brand and will stay at other hotels in the chain

But if a chain doesn’t enforce brand standards the brand gets diluted. Guests used to think the brand stood for a certain level of quality but they learn that’s not the case. When one hotel doesn’t uphold standards it may not hurt that hotel but it hurts other hotels the guest might have stayed at which share the brand and it hurts the value of the brand itself which is what the chain markets.

Chains have a short-term incentive to look the other way because that maximizes revenue for them. Hotel owners want the benefit of the brand at lowest cost. If chains impose costs on owners the owners will go somewhere else to a different brand. So being ‘easy for an owner to work with’ the chain can sign up the most hotels and generate the most fees.

because that maximizes revenue for them. Hotel owners want the benefit of the brand at lowest cost. If chains impose costs on owners the owners will go somewhere else to a different brand. So being ‘easy for an owner to work with’ the chain can sign up the most hotels and generate the most fees. That’s a long-run destruction of value for the chain. The hotel owner pays a chain to rent its brand but if the brand has less value fewer owners will receive benefit for the fees. Owners sometimes talk about a loyalty program member as a “lead” and the chain’s website as lead-generation. If guests don’t value the brand they don’t go to the chain website to choose it over competitors and they no longer have the reputation or customer base to sell. Hotel loyalty program devaluations further the problem.

Before the pandemic we saw a shift away from enforcements of some brand standards. For instance the Grand Hyatt San Francisco started experimenting with the elimination of room service. This wasn’t just a Hilton Hyatt or Marriott dropping room service in exchange for a grab-n-go market this was a more premium brand sacrificing higher standards for lower costs. Hyatt also dropped guaranteed turndown service as an elite benefit to lower housekeeping costs.

But the pandemic accelerated these trends. Owners were demanding lower costs and relaxed standards. The Marriott acquisition of Starwood led the Bethesda-based company to promise owners lower costs. And the amalgam of 30 brands made no sense so they leaned into their loyalty program and website and having a presence everywhere rather than any clear brand messaging.

Chains like Marriott started enforcing the brand standards that existed far less. It wasn’t just about suspending standards for a period while business dissipated as a result of the pandemic. Once standards were officially returned they were policed less than ever. It wasn’t just club lounges not re-opening (that wasn’t a violation of a standard) and housekeeping standards relaxed (again consistent with the rules) it was hotels not re-opening food and beverage outlets when the chains said those should be open and properties doing an inferior job actually cleaning rooms. They kept fewer housekeepers and expected them to service rooms more quickly.

It’s this short-run sacrifice of brand standards both de jure (reduced standards) and de facto (lack of enforcement) that has made individual owners happy in the short-tun but is sacrificing any long-run value for chains.

That lessens the gap between Airbnb and a hotel. If you’re not going to get daily housekeeping or even a thoroughly cleaned room and the hotel is going to add destination or resort (or energy) fees – and isn’t going to offer full service food and beverage on property – then how is it a better more seamless experience than Airbnb fees and all?

While a hotel chain’s customers are property owners and guests are the product not the customer it’s a dangerous game that many chains are playing focusing on short-term revenue from owners and risking long-term value for shareholders.

When the Marriotts and Hiltons of the world actually owned the hotels that they marketed there was better alignment of incentives for maintaining and extending their brands (and they found it much easier to deliver promises to guests on-property). An ‘asset light’ model where the chain simply rents out the brand can work – but needs a laser-like focus on defending and growing the value of the brand not merely living off of and depreciating it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpdGVsaW5lc2IuY29tL3RoZS1oaWx0b24tc2FudGEtYmFyYmFyYS1oYXMtcGxhbnMtZm9yLWEtYmlnLWV4cGFuc2lvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Siteline | The Hilton Santa Barbara Has Big Expansion Plans,"••• It’s like hyperlocal HGTV: “My name is Laura Rice.

However the options available won’t work quite as efficiently as those offered by professionally-installed gutter guards.

Home Depot does offer professional installations for some products which sometimes come with a workmanship warranty.

Home Depot also carries stainless steel micro mesh gutter guards which are relatively uncommon to find at a home improvement store. These options typically come with a manufacturer’s warranty but there usually is no performance warranty since you’ll be installing them yourself.

Similar to other home improvement stores like Lowes Home Depot carries many options for gutter guards. These include foam gutter guards (also called filter gutter guards) screen gutter guards mesh gutter guards brush gutter guards and reverse-curve gutter guards (also called surface tension guards).

These DIY options offer ease of installation and a process that typically doesn’t require lifting and doesn’t damage roof shingles so the products are unlikely to void any existing gutter or roof warranties.

As you probably know Home Depot is a home improvement store that carries a massive range of products empowering homeowners to complete DIY projects around the house. The store carries a variety of gutter guard options that you can install yourself allowing you to save quite a bit of money on a professional installation.

In this guide to gutter guard solutions we’ll discuss the options you have at Home Depot how well they work to prevent clogs their pricing warranty coverage and more. This information should help you decide if the Home Depot gutter guards with DIY installation are best for your home or if you’d be better off with a professionally installed solution.

What you might not know is that keeping your gutters clean and free of clogs and blockages is just as important as having a gutter system in the first place since overflow from plugged improperly functioning gutters can cause severe property damage over time as well. Gutter guards are a key home improvement for keeping debris out of your gutters ensuring that they drain freely.

Gutters are critical for protecting your home. They route runoff away from your foundation which helps avoid structural issues foundation leaks moisture accumulation pest infestations and much more.

If you’ve been researching gutter guard options you’ve probably wondered if the DIY gutter guards you can buy from Home Depot are any good.

Home Depot Gutter Guard Review

Gutter guards are crucial pieces of equipment that protect your home from costly damage. We understand the importance of properly-functioning gutter guards which is why we assess companies who offer them based on numerous criteria.

Below we’ll discuss the most important factors we consider when reviewing Home Depot gutter guard systems and how each plays into our overall rating.

Products

Home Depot provides a range of DIY options for homeowners looking to install their own gutter guards. It carries screen gutter guards mesh gutter guards brush gutter guards and foam gutter guards as do many other home improvement stores.

It also offers DIY solutions for micro mesh gutter guards which are far less common in the DIY space but offer the best solution for efficiency and affordability.

Home Depot’s most popular gutter guard options include:

Gutter Guard by GutterGlove products

Amerimax Titan Aluminum Mesh Gutter Guard

Amerimax Lock-in Metal Mesh Gutter Guard

Best-1 Gutter Guard (micro mesh)

GutterFoam Foam Filter Gutter Guard

GutterBrush Max-Flow Filter Brush Gutter Guard

This is an excellent representation of the different types of gutter guards available and it provides homeowners with quite a few viable options for gutter protection.

These gutter guards are available in different materials and offer varying durability and pricing. The most affordable gutter guards from Home Depot are made of foam or PVC which is reasonably durable but can warp with prolonged exposure to sunlight high temperature and high humidity levels.

The best durability comes from gutter guards with aluminum frames and stainless steel micro mesh screens. The brush gutter guards available also have excellent durability.

The type of gutter guard you purchase from Home Depot will dictate its efficiency. For example foam and brush gutter guards are considered entry-level options that will help reduce gutter clogs but won’t prevent them entirely.

The screen mesh and reverse-curve gutter guards will perform slightly better but the micro mesh options will provide the highest level of efficiency.

How Home Depot Gutter Guards Work

Regardless of the style of gutter guard you choose they all work the same way; they’re designed to let water flow through the protective layer — whether that’s made of bristles PVC stainless steel mesh or solid PVC with a reverse curve — while stopping debris from getting caught in your gutter system.

The mechanism for trapping debris varies but all types block leaves and sticks from clogging your gutters while the best gutter guards stop smaller debris as well like pine needles leaf fragments roof grit and pollen.

Since Home Depot offers mostly DIY gutter guard options the process of getting protection for your gutters is relatively straightforward.

All the available choices can be found on the Home Depot website. Some options are available immediately for delivery or store pickup. Other options like Gutter Guard by Gutterglove need to be ordered for delivery to your home or for in-store pickup.

Either way you need to purchase the lengths based on the perimeter of your home (plus an extra five to ten percent for mistakes and lengths you’ll need to cut for going around corners) — then install them based on the manufacturer’s instructions. The installation process shouldn’t be too lengthy or complicated.

Warranty Coverage

The warranty coverage for the gutter guards available from Home Depot varies based on the product and the manufacturer. The warranties typically range from around two years up to 25 years and most of them cover manufacturing defects only.

If your product fails because of a problem in the manufacturing process you can get a free replacement or compensation for the materials you purchased. Of course the products with 25-year warranties are generally a better option for obvious reasons.

One of the downsides of DIY gutter guards is the general lack of a performance warranty.

When you opt to go with a professional gutter guard installer — like LeafFilter or MasterShield — you typically get a warranty for the actual product holding up but also for how the gutter guards perform. The company can guarantee that the product is installed properly so it has no issue guaranteeing that the product will work as intended.

With a DIY installation you could install the gutter guards improperly so companies are far less likely to offer a performance warranty. Even those that do offer one — like the Amerimax Titan gutter guards — won’t cover issues caused by improper installation and proving that the product was installed properly is challenging.

Home Depot also offers professional installations for some of its gutter guard products. If you opt to have one of Home Depot’s providers install your gutter guards you might be offered a performance warranty from the company.

You’re also more likely to be able to prove that the guards were installed properly so you could take advantage of the manufacturer’s performance warranty in that case as well.

Home Depot Gutter Guard Installation

If you choose to install your Home Depot gutter guards yourself the installation process will depend on the specific product you choose.

For example if you opt for the GutterBrush Max-Flow Filter you’ll simply place the brush in your gutters cutting or bending the product when you get to any corners.

Installing the GutterFoam gutter guards is as simple as cutting the foam to length with a utility knife and then popping it into place being sure to tuck one side of the foam under the front lip in the outward-facing edge of the gutter before pushing the back side down to secure it in place.

The Amerimax Lock-In gutter guards work in a similar way to the foam guards while some other options require screwing the covers into your fascia or existing gutters.

Here’s an example of an installation:

The process is even simpler if you choose to have one of Home Depot’s gutter guard installers complete the process for you. You’ll just need to speak with a sales representative in the store schedule the installation and then wait for the provider to install your gutter guards.

Home Depot Gutter Guard Cost

Home Depot’s gutter guards all have different costs per linear foot with some options being more than triple the cost of others.

Prices range from $0.50 per linear foot to $2.46 per linear foot. For a 1000-square foot house you can expect your price to fall between $110 and $550 or an average of approximately $350.

Remember it’s best to account for 5-10% more material than you think you need to account for mistakes and offcuts. In general the gutter guards from Home Depot are very affordable as the average cost per linear foot for gutter guards with a professional installation is around $8.

Availability

One of the most significant upsides to opting for gutter guards from Home Depot is the wide availability. Home Depot has just under 2000 locations across all 50 states so most homeowners will have no issue getting gutter guards from their local store — although as described above some choices need to be ordered for in-store or home delivery.

You can purchase your gutter guards from the Home Depot website and have them delivered to your home or a specific store for pickup.

Home Depot Gutter Guard Reviews

There are lots of reviews for Home Depot in general on the internet but the reviews for the individual products offered matter more in terms of your installation experience and how well your gutter guards function. Since Home Depot offers a wide variety of gutter guards for DIY installation the reviews of the products offered vary quite a bit.

One of the most popular products the GutterGlove gutter guards maintains a five-star overall rating even with thousands of reviews posted. Most of the reviews mention how easy the product is to install and how well it works to keep debris out of the gutters.

Some of the negative reviews complain about debris still getting through and water spilling over the sides of the gutters and collecting next to the home’s foundation especially during heavy rain. No gutter guard is perfect so some issues are expected and these can be caused by improper installation.

Another of Home Depot’s top gutter guard products — the Amerimax Titan gutter guards — maintains a four-star overall rating.

Positive reviews mention how well these gutter guards work and how durable they are even in cases of extreme weather. Some of the negative reviews cite how frustrating they can be to install and how the shape lets leaves and other debris collect on top which necessitates frequent cleaning and allows some water to flow over the gutter entirely.

Again no gutter guard is ideal so there will always be some downsides to any DIY product.

Below we’ll include some reviews of specific gutter guard system products from Home Depot to help you get a feel for what to expect when installing these on your home.

“[These] were easier to manage/install than I originally thought. The construction is very sturdy but lightweight. I’m confident they will last but [they are] light enough to handle safely on a ladder or while on the roof. These gutter guards slid into place with no issue. I installed over 184 feet with multiple inverted and outward corners. With these gutter guards installed I won’t be on the roof or on the ladder cleaning out leaves sticks or anything else for that matter from my gutters.” — J Dubs via HomeDepot.com for the GutterGlove Gutter Guards

“These work great. Had them for years. Previously I had the wire mesh type. Wire mesh is too restrictive. The wire mesh I had worked for 3 years only then water just ran over the top. They never clog up. I get no algae or any build-up. I’ve had them on for 7 years plus. Never seen water overflow ever. It’s great having these on because they do work. These perforated type gutter guards are the best.” — Charles via HomeDepot.com for the Amerimax Titan Aluminum Gutter Guards

“Had Home Depot install new gutters and these gutter guards three years ago. The guard sits inside the gutter not over the top. Subsequently fir needles cedar cones and leaf debris still collects and just sits on top of the screen. At least twice a year you will be on the roof using a leaf blower to remove the mess. Further where the gutter goes around an inside corner the debris can get so deep that water simply runs over the top and not into the gutter at all.” — Jet via HomeDepot.com for the Amerimax Titan Gutter Guards

Final Thoughts & Our Recommendation

The gutter guards from Home Depot are a great value costing significantly less than professionally-installed gutter guards. However there are some downsides that might not make the savings worth it for you.

First you’ll have to complete the installation yourself in most cases although there is the option of a professional installation from Home Depot’s service providers. Second you typically won’t get a lifetime warranty or a performance warranty and the general performance won’t be as good as the high-quality products that are professionally installed.

That being said the gutter guards available from Home Depot are a great option if you want to go the DIY route. Many of the options are durable and perform well provided you install them according to the manufacturer’s directions.

They aren’t quite as efficient as the micro mesh gutter guards you can get from professional gutter guard companies but based on the positive customer reviews for some of the products many of them work well enough especially given the lower cost.

If you do decide to purchase gutter guards from Home Depot and install them yourself we suggest going with the GutterGlove guards which are highly rated on Home Depot’s website and are easy to install and known to work reasonably well.

Police said the suspect showed a gun demanded money and then fled. They then drove off in a white van shortly after.

Officers said shortly after the robbery they used traffic cameras to identify the vehicle involved and shared the photos on social media. Almost immediately investigators said they received tips from community members who recognized Plump from photos.

Leigh Jerrard of Greywater Corps a California-based irrigation installer argues that anyone with a roof and a garden—or those simply interested in living more sustainably—should consider investing in a rain barrel. And while he may personally be most familiar with systems that can hold as much as 500 to 5000 gallons of runoff (!) you don’t have to default to something so oversize from the start. Our best rain barrel picks below are small enough to set up on your own.

Our Favorites

Rainwater Collection Urn Gardener’s Supply ($199) Shop

Gallons: 50 | Material: Plastic | Height: 45 inches

What we like: Chic body

Overflow valve

Brass spigot

Complimentary 5-foot hose Worth noting: Some assembly required

Why we chose it: A ceramic look alike that’s actually durable plastic.

Add some leafy greens or floral friends on the top of this rain barrel and you might just fool people into thinking it’s an extra-tall terracotta pot. The shapely silhouette is actually made from a UV- scratch- and chip-resistant polyethylene (just a fancy way to say tough plastic) which mimics a matte finish to play up the disguise. Beneath the removable decorative lid is a screen guard to keep out bugs and allow air to still freely flow (no mold or algae to worry about here). It tops our list for its attractive exterior and equally functional features.

Best Slim: Bosmere Slim Rain Barrel

Shop

Gallons: 26 | Material: Plastic | Height: 38 inches

What we like: Earthy green colorway

Great for small spaces

Complimentary stand Worth noting: May easily overflow

Why we chose it: This compact container will still catch enough runoff to water your garden.

If you’re not looking for anything too grandiose or simply don’t have the space for anything larger than a foot or so in diameter might we direct you to the Bosmere? Described by veteran features and garden editor Melissa Ozawa as “tall and svelte” you can squeeze this slender vessel into many a tight backyard corner and still repurpose 26 gallons of gray water. A lockable lid keeps things secure from curious critters and it ships with a compatible easy-assembly stand that lifts the unit off the ground an extra 11 inches. That way you don’t have to finagle your watering can underneath the spout; simply turn the tap and fill. Sadly we’ve noticed it’s often in-and-out-of-stock.

Best Recycled: Earthminded Drainable Rain Station

Plastic Drainable Planter Rain Barrel and Hose Earthminded ($123) Shop

Gallons: 45 | Material: Plastic | Height: 35 inches

What we like: Easy to install

Includes a diverter

Made in the U.S. Worth noting: Plastic spigot

On the heavy side

Why we chose it: Made from up to 85 percent recycled food-grade resin.

You’ll need a drill to attach this standard rain barrel to your home’s downspout install the complimentary diverter and attach the hose—but it’s all worth it. Choose between a black or terracotta exterior both of which would look great against the backdrop of a home with dark siding. It also comes with a water hole cover so as soon as the temperatures dip you can plug up the hole to prevent expansion from ice and detach the barrel to safely store it indoors. And much like our top pick we love that the lid on this model is reversible which means you can plant anything from flowers to herbs to trailing ivy on top.

Best Upcycled: Mirainbarrel Whiskey Barrel

Whiskey/Bourbon Barrel Rain Barrel Home Depot ($477) Shop

Gallons: 53 | Material: Wood | Height: Varies

What we like: Natural white oak

Complete with a sealed system

Returnable in 90 days

Compatible with a standard garden hose Worth noting: Should be installed by a professional (but coordination is free!)

Why we chose it: A real-deal barrel upgraded to catch more rain.

To be honest there are a lot of rain barrels on the market that try to look like a wood barrel but they’re generally made from plastic. If this is the sort of farmhouse-y aesthetic you’re going for why not try the real deal? Buy a barrel that in another life held whiskey and bourbon instead of rain. Yet this isn’t your basic barrel—it’s backed by a patented overflow prevention system and rust-proof ports; comes with a diverter and hole saw; and is a breeze to winterize. And there’s no concern about it weathering outdoors where it’ll be exposed to the elements since it already ships with a unique patina.

Best Collapsible: LOSTRONAUT Collapsible Rain Barrel

Portable Rain Barrel Water Tank LOSTRONAUT ($56 was $70) Shop

Gallons: 53 | Material: Vinyl | Height: 27.5 inches

What we like: Less than $100

Lightweight

Foldable design Worth noting: Not as sturdy compared to others on this list

Why we chose it: Simple and sleek this will pack up into a storage bag.

If you don’t want to mess with a crazy winterizing routine then this collapsible rain barrel is for you. It folds up all neat and compact small enough to store away like a lawn chair. In fact you could bring it out just for when a storm is about to roll through rather than leave it out all day every day. It comes with the bells and whistles you’d expect of the best rain barrel too: an overflow pipe two spigots and a nylon mesh screen to prevent bacteria growth. While it may feel flimsy when you first install it (it’s only 5 pounds altogether) previous owners and reviewers agree it becomes sturdier the more it’s filled.

We Also Liked

The Great American Rain Barrel ($159) is actually a repurposed food container that can hold up to 60 gallons of runoff though a diverter (large or small) will cost you extra.

Great American Rain Barrel ($159) is actually a repurposed food container that can hold up to 60 gallons of runoff though a diverter (large or small) will cost you extra. There are color choices galore from the Impressions Plastic Drainable Rain Barrel ($484). Paired with a brass spigot and a whopping 90-gallon capacity the only feature we weren’t totally sold on was the faux roughened exterior.

How We Chose These Products

We tapped Ozawa to scour the market for the best (and best-looking) rain barrels then rounded out the selections with other choices from Domino editors. Our picks speak to the size of your household and general living situation as well as offer a range of materials in addition to the standard plastic. For a greater understanding of the topic (what should you really look for in the best rain barrel?) we reached out to Greywater Corps’s Jerrard who has plenty of experience in establishing stormwater irrigation systems throughout California. We also spoke with Hippo consumer trends expert Courtney Klosterman about insurance and liability associated with this product and keeping their intel in mind we then made sure our picks deter algae and bugs.

Our Shopping Checklist

Purpose

“As we continue to experience extreme droughts and water rationing is put into place rain barrels are a great way to collect fresh free rainwater to use for outdoor purposes” offers Klosterman. “Not only will this save money and energy but it can protect the environment.” A rain barrel connects to downspouts to collect runoff and it includes a spigot that a hose can hook up to or fill a watering can. And it’s an essential part of your potential rainscaping plan. You’ll just need to make sure you’re allowed to use one first Kolsterman advises: “Some locations throughout the U.S. require permits for rainwater harvesting or prohibit rain barrels outright while others may offer financial incentives.”

Location

After confirming it’s A-OK to set up a rain barrel in your neighborhood the next step is figuring out the best place to position it. “Start by looking at downspout locations—it’s easiest to divert water into barrels if they’re close to downspouts” advises Jerrard. “Additionally we look for level unobstructed areas near gardens or plants that will appreciate the water. We also try to find unused spaces like side-yard setbacks so you’re not occupying outdoor living areas.”

Size and Volume

Our list of the best rain barrels definitely skews on the smaller side but it can be intimidating to install anything larger than 100 gallons. And in general this is still a ton of rainwater. For those living in the drier parts of the country being able to capture as much water as possible makes sense but for everyone else it isn’t totally necessary. A smaller barrel say between 20 and 90 gallons may not be the greatest at optimal water capture but it’s less likely to become a prominent eyesore in your backyard.

Material

“The cheapest and sturdiest material is polyethylene—these tanks will last a lifetime but not everyone likes the aesthetic” shares Jerrard. “Galvanized steel tanks are beautiful and range in size from a few hundred to thousands of gallons.”

And while Jerrard isn’t the biggest fan of wood recycled oak wine or whiskey barrels are still a suitable vessel—they just may wear a little quicker in the elements (especially if you happen to live somewhere that experiences extreme changes in temperature).

Ask Domino

Q: Should I worry about my rain barrel attracting bugs?

“Not if they’re installed properly! You want to make sure all points of access are screened with fine mesh—inlet and overflow” offers Jerrard. “If this is done correctly you’ll have no problem with mosquitoes. Monitoring and maintenance is also key to check any pooling water or decomposing leaf mulch.”

Q: Can a rain barrel overflow? What happens if it does?

“All tanks will fill up and overflow at some point” shares Jerrard. “It’s important to direct this water to a safe place away from building foundations and hopefully somewhere it can percolate back into the land—unless flooding or erosion is a concern in which case you should direct it to the street.”

Q: Do I need to clean my rain barrel?

You should be keeping tabs on your gutters more so than your rain barrel. “Clean gutters are vital to ensuring not only the health of exterior surfaces around your home but even your foundation walls. Clogs in your gutters can result in immeasurable damage over time especially during heavy rainfalls” Klosterman points out. “Checking this item off your home maintenance checklist is definitely worth the effort.”

The Last Word

The best rain barrels according to Jerrard “save water reduce stormwater runoff and can be a source of emergency drinking water.” But they don’t have to be an eyesore."

He was known for his extraordinary dribbling skills and his two siblings remember him dribbling all the way to the BB court at White’s Park from their home on Beacon Street and back many times and then laying in his bed spinning the ball on his finger many nights. He also played on teams at the Concord YMCA.

He was a marathon runner participating in Boston Marathons and several others as well. He loved to play ping pong (table tennis) and competed in various tournaments. He loved chess and Chinese checkers. Bird watching was a favorite pastime. A trip to Aransas Pass in Texas with family afforded him one of many such bird watching experiences. A favorite pastime was enjoying a good cigar on his back porch while watching the birds at his feeders. Ron enjoyed playing cribbage at the community center in Keene these last few years as well as bowling on a senior league. He attended the Keene Unitarian Universalist Church as that was a good match for his beliefs and understanding of life.

Ron was a handy man and did a lot of carpentry jobs modifying his own home(s). He was an avid reader and particularly enjoyed mysteries. A good philosophical conversation always energized him as well. He was a bit of a skeptic and was often heard asking “What’s the point?” or “As evidenced by what?”

Three travel highlights for him in his life were taking his adult children on a two-month camping trip through the great northwest a trip to Prince Edward Island with his daughter and a trip to Ireland with his sister to visit the land of their ancestors.

In May of this year Ronald decided to move from Keene NH (where he’d lived for the past 45 years) to Dallas TX to be nearer his four children. He drove by himself at age 85 despite some major health issues. Ronald was sharp right to the end and had a delightful sense of humor. He recently wrote in an email that the excitement that day at his senior living quarters was that there was a fly in the water pitcher. He was extremely proud of his kids’ accomplishments and so very happy to spend his final months near them. His health quickly declined there but he was ready to let nature take its course and as he would often say that’s the “long story short.”

Ronald leaves behind his four children: Kimberly Wies (husband Ron) of Houston TX; Tom Kee (wife Rae) of Wichita Falls TX; Susan Kee of Broken Arrow. OK; and Lori Turner (husband Lee) of Tulsa OK. He leaves several dearly loved grandchildren and great grandchildren as well as his brother Ralph Kee (wife Judith) of Boston MA and his sister Rita Kee McDonald of Concord NH. He’ll be missed by several nieces nephews and cousins. He also leaves a dear friend and neighbor who has always been there for him Leslie Crossman of Keene NH. The family expresses their sincere gratitude to her.

At Ronald’s request there will be no visitation or service. His final resting place is the New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery in Boscawen NH.

Contributions in his memory could be made to any autism charity of choice as that was a cause near and dear to his heart.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmlsYXRpbWVzLm5ldC8yMDIyLzA4LzEzL3B1YmxpYy1zcXVhcmUvdHVya2lzaC10ZWNobmljLWFuZC1ob25leXdlbGwtc3RyZW5ndGhlbi10aGVpci1jb29wZXJhdGlvbi8xODU0NDQ40gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFuaWxhdGltZXMubmV0LzIwMjIvMDgvMTMvcHVibGljLXNxdWFyZS90dXJraXNoLXRlY2huaWMtYW5kLWhvbmV5d2VsbC1zdHJlbmd0aGVuLXRoZWlyLWNvb3BlcmF0aW9uLzE4NTQ0NDgvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turkish Technic and Honeywell strengthen their cooperation,"On the signing of the agreement: Turkish Technic CEO Mikail Akbulut and Uygar Doyuran president of Honeywell Turkey Israel and Central Asia.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

According to the display:

“Throughout World War I engineers tried to make aircraft engines more powerful lighter and reliable. The warring nations produced many innovative designs in a short period of time to improve aircraft altitude speed and endurance.”

Shown below are some of the aircraft engines which were displayed in the Early Years Gallery.

Shown above is the Salmson Z-9 engine (France 1918). It generated 280 hp and weighed 473 pounds.

Shown above is the ABC Wasp engine (Great Britain 1918). It generated 170 hp and weighed 290 pounds.

Shown above is the Bentley B.R.2 engine (Great Britain 1917). It generated 230 hp and weighed 500 pounds.

Shown above is the Renault 12 Fe engine (France 1917). It generated 300 hp and weighed 794 pounds.

Shown above is the Curtiss K-12 engine (United States 1917). It generated 375 hp and weighed 678 pounds.

Shown above is the Benz Bz.IV engine (Germany 1916). It generated 200 hp and weighed 848 pounds.

Shown above is the Anzani 10 engine (France Great Britain 1915). It generated 90-100 hp and weighed 121 pounds.

Shown above is the R.A.F. 1A engine (Great Britain 1913). It generated 90 hp and weighed 440 pounds.

Shown above is the Fiat A-12 engine (Italy 1916). It generated 280 hp and weighed 920 pounds.

Shown above is the Sturtevant 5A engine (United States 1916-1917).

According to the Museum:

The Sturtevant 5A engine rated at 140 hp powered the Sturtevant S-4 and some L.W.F. V-1 training airplanes used by the Signal Corps at North Island Calif. and Mineola N.Y. during 1916 and 1917. Neither of these airplanes proved suitable partly because of the 5A engine's high power to weight ratio of 3.5 pounds per horsepower. The Army soon replaced those aircraft with the Standard J-1 and Curtiss JN-4 trainers.

Shown above is the Wright 6-60 engine (United States).

According to the Museum:

The U.S. Army Signal Corps used Wright 6-cylinder water-cooled engines to power its Wright Model C and D airplanes. Although originally rated at 50 hp this improved version of the Wright 6-cylinder possessed 60 hp (""6-60"" referred to its 6-cylinder-60-hp capacity).

Shown above is the Roberts Model 4-X engine (United States). It developed 50 hp and weighed 170 pounds.

According to the Museum:

This four-cylinder water-cooled engine was made by the Roberts Motor Co. of Sandusky Ohio around 1910. Roberts used secret alloys it called ""Aerotite"" and ""Magnalium"" to enhance performance and reduce weight. The motor weighing 170 pounds and developing 50 hp was used in some Benoist and American-owned Bleriot aircraft. It cost $1500 by mail order when it was new.

Shown above is the Kirkham 4-Cylinder engine (United States 1912-1914). It developed 40 hp.

According to the Museum:

Charles B. Kirkham of Savona N.Y. made this four-cylinder water-cooled engine around 1912-1914. Its exact origin is unclear but Hillery Beachy a well-known early aviator was likely involved in its design or use. Though it resembles an auto engine similar Kirkham motors powered several early aircraft. Roe Tanner a brick mason and inventor used this 40-hp Kirkham in Attica Ohio around 1914 to ground test ideas for variable-pitch propellers.

Shown above is the Curtiss V2-3 engine (United States 1916-1917). It is rated at 200 hp.

According to the Museum:

In 1916 and 1917 Curtiss produced R-3 and R-4 airplanes for the U.S. Army Signal Corps some of which the 1st Aero Squadron used during the Mexican Punitive Expedition. The Curtiss V2-3 engine rated at 200 hp powered both those airplanes; however it had a poor power to weight ratio -- almost four pounds for every 1 hp -- which hurt aircraft performance. By comparison the World War I Liberty engine had a ratio of two pounds weight per horsepower.

Shown above is the Curtiss OX-5 engine (United States). This 90 hp engine was used in the Curtiss “Jenny” airplane.

According to the Museum:

Thousands of OX-5 water-cooled engines were produced in the United States during World War I primarily for the Curtiss Jenny airplane. The engine a refinement of a 1914 design was rated at only 90 hp. Compared to other airplane engines of the period it was very reliable. Some OX-5 engines are still being used in restored Jenny airplanes throughout the nation.

Shown above is the LeRhone C-9 engine (France 1916). This 90 hp engine weighed 240 pounds.

Shown above is the Oberursel UR-2 rotary engine (Germany).

According to the Museum:

The Oberursel UR-2 rotary engine rated at 110 hp was the type used to power the Fokker Dr.1 triplane. Built by the Oberursel Motoren Gesellschaft of Frankfurt Germany it was an exact copy of the famous French LeRhone 110-hp rotary engine.

Shown above is the Gnome N-9 rotary engine (France 1909). This was one of the most important designs in early aviation.

According to the Museum:

The French Gnome engine was one of the most important designs in early aviation and a main source of aircraft power for the Allies in World War I. First appearing 1909 this engine type was developed into several models and used throughout the war. The 9-cylinder model on display at the museum is typical of the Gnome design.



The Gnome was a rotary type meaning the engine and propeller were bolted together and both rotated around a fixed shaft. Air passing over the hot cylinders cooled the spinning engine. Gnome Monosoupape (single valve) engines like the one on display had one valve per cylinder acting as both air inlet and exhaust. Fuel was mixed with air not in a carburetor but in the hollow central shaft where the fuel-air mixture entered each cylinder at its base.



Gnome engines were reliable and powerful for their weight but had certain drawbacks. First the gyroscopic effect of the heavy spinning engine made quick left turns easy but hard right turns were difficult. Second the motor used a large amount of fuel and lubricating castor oil and some of the unburned oil was thrown from the spinning engine making life unpleasant for pilot a few feet behind it. A cowling around the engine directed most of this under the aircraft but thick greasy fumes and oil inevitably coated the pilot. Castor oil was used because it burns cleanly but pilots joked about its well-known laxative effect.

Shown above is the King-Bugatti U-16 engine (United States 1918). This 410 hp engine weighed 1286 pounds.

Shown above is the Liberty L-8 engine (United State 1917). This 270 hp engine weighed 575 pounds.

Shown above is the Liberty L-6 engine (United States 1918). This 215 hp engine weighed 550 pounds.

Shown above is the Liberty L-4 engine (United States 1918). This 102 hp engine weighed 398 pounds.

Shown above is the Packard Liberty 12A engine (United States 1923). This 449 hp engine weighed 844 pounds.

Shown above is the Wright R-790 engine (United States 1920s).

According to the Museum:

The 225-hp R-790 was a standard U.S. Air Corps radial engine used in several types of airplanes during the 1920s and 1930s. Some significant long-distance flights during that era featured R-790s.

Shown above is the Liberty 12-A inverted engine (United States 1918). This 425 hp engine weighed 845 pounds. This was one of America’s greatest technological contributions during World War I. The engine was turned upside down to improve pilot visibility. During the War 20748 Liberty 12s were made.

According to the Museum:

The inverted Liberty is a conversion of the famous Liberty 12 one of America's greatest technological contributions during World War I. During the war 20478 Liberty 12s were produced in the United States and used primarily in U.S.-built DH-4s the only American-made airplane to get into combat over the Western Front.



Initial attempts to invert the Liberty engine took place in 1918-1919 but technical problems delayed the first flight until 1923. Inverted Liberty 12-As produced until 1926 were conversions of the standard engine. Most were used in the Loening OA-1 amphibians designed specifically for the inverted engine. Among the advantages were high propeller position (for hull clearance in the amphibian) better visibility and easier access for the mechanics.

Shown above is the Curtiss D-12 engine (United States 1921).

According to the Museum:

The 375-hp Curtiss D-12 engine introduced in 1921 became one of the most successful aircraft engines of the 1920s. Developed from Curtiss' K-12 engine used in World War I the D-12 replaced the gears connecting the crankshaft to the propeller with a more reliable direct-drive connection hence the ""D"" for direct-drive. Also Curtiss attached a new propeller designed by acoustics engineer Dr. S.A. Reed. It could rotate at a higher speed than conventional propellers allowing the engine to use its full power. This combination made the D-12 the most advanced power plant in the world.

Shown above is the Curtiss V-1570 Conqueror engine (United States 1926). This 675 hp engine weighed 770 pounds.

Shown above is the Wright R-1820 Cyclone engine (United States 1931).

According to the Museum:

The Wright Aeronautical Corp. introduced the 9-cylinder air-cooled R-1820 radial engine in 1931. Developed from earlier ""Cyclone"" engines of the late 1920s the larger and more powerful R-1820 produced 575 hp; however engineers dramatically improved its performance over many years of production with several later versions being rated at 1525 hp.



Although the R-1820 powered thousands of military and civilian aircraft it remains best known as the engine that powered Boeing's B-17 Flying Fortress in World War II.

Shown above is the Almen A-4 Barrel engine (United States 1920s). This 425 hp engine weighed 749 pounds.

According to the Museum:

The water-cooled A-4 barrel engine (18 cylinders -- two groups of nine each horizontally opposed) was the fourth experimental barrel engine built for testing at McCook Field Ohio by its inventor Mr. J.O. Almen of Seattle Wash. The project began in 1921 and by the mid-1920s the A-4 passed its acceptance tests. The engine never went into production however reportedly because of limited funds and a growing emphasis by the U.S. Army Air Corps on air-cooled radial engines.



This unique engine had a much smaller frontal area than other water-cooled engines of similar horsepower thereby providing better streamlining and less air resistance. It was rated at 425 hp but weighed only 749 pounds (a power to weight ratio of better than one to two) a significant design achievement in the early 1920s.

Shown above is the Packard 3A-2500 engine (United States 1926). This 800 hp engine weighed 1425 pounds.

Shown above is the Ranger L-4400 engine.

According to the Museum:

The L-440 air-cooled six-cylinder inverted in-line engine was manufactured by the Ranger Aircraft Engine Division of Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corp. Built in several versions ranging from 175 hp to 200 hp L-440 series engines powered more than 6000 Fairchild PT-19 and PT-26 during World War II.

The three destroyers of the class are set to be the first to be armed with Long-range hypersonic weapons.

Mississippi-based shipyard Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) will soon complete the installation of the nation’s first long-range hypersonic weaponry on the Zumwalt-class warships USNI News reported.

The Navy has chosen Ingalls Shipbuilding for a dry-dock period for the guided-missile destroyers USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) and USS Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001) according to an August 12 pre-solicitation notice from Naval Sea Systems Command.

“The modernization scope of the effort will require specialized yard cranes for greater lift capacity dry-dock facilities covered assembly areas and dedicated fabrication shops” reads the notice. “Use of an alternative source other than HII would result in the unacceptable ship and program schedule delays and would produce adverse impacts to the DDG 1000/1001 operational requirements” the report says.

The announcement didn’t specify availability dates but Capt. Matthew Schroeder program manager for the DDG-1000 at the Program Executive Office Ships said in March that the upgrade phase to equip Zumwalt with hypersonic missiles will begin in October 2023.

The mainstay of these Zumwalt-class destroyers is the Advanced Gun System (AGS) a naval artillery system developed to provide long-range gunfire support against shore-based targets. A total of six of the systems were installed two on each of the three Zumwalt-class ships.

However it soon ran into trouble. Only the ammunition created solely for AGS could be used on it. Only one ammunition type was designed and the Navy halted its procurement in November 2016 due to cost overruns. It became a defense project with a 17% cost overrun from $12 billion to $14 billion.

Eventually the number of vessels planned was reduced from 32 to only three. Even though there were calls to do away with these vessels the US Navy decided to keep them.

Ironically hypersonic missiles will take the place of the Advanced Gun System (AGS) the distinctive component of the vessel.

Zumwalt: From Rockets To Hypersonic Missiles

It was revealed earlier this year that the Navy would replace the two 155mm Advanced Gun System mounts on each ship with tubes to fit the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) Vertical Launch System developed for Army Air Force and Navy.

A source accessed by USNI News said that the AGS mounts would be removed during the time frame specified in the August 12 notice.

The AGS which extends several floors below the ship’s bow and houses the magazines for the rocket-launched Long Range Land Attack Projectile was designed around the 16000-ton ships. After the LRLAP program was canceled in 2016 the Navy abandoned the idea.

According to a plan presented by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Mike Gilday the two tubes for the Common-Hypersonic Glide (C-HGB) were initially intended to be installed on the port starboard sides of the ship without removing the two 155-mm AGS gun mounts.

To make room for the C-HGB which is much larger than any missile in the USN inventory the entire section of five platforms—two gun chambers the loading system transfer carts and ammo—will have to be taken down by October 2023.

The EurAsian Times had earlier described the vessel’s issues including its distinctive “tumblehome” hull which was considered unstable and may topple over if a wave struck the ship at the correct sea state angle and speed. In addition the groundbreaking Integrated Power System (IPS) has software faults that result in several operational concerns.

Frustrated by these troubles and the unsustainability of keeping the Zumwalt-class vessels the Navy finally decided to convert the Zumwalts from littoral and shallow waters capable of land-attack amphibious support vessels to blue-water strike platforms in 2017.

However with the need for hypersonic weapons gaining traction it finally settled on removing these stealthy angular turrets and ammunition hull magazines to install the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) hypersonic missiles vertical launch system (VLS) tubes.

“We are removing the guns the upper and lower gun rooms. That includes the loading system the transfer carts the ammo etc.” Schroeder told USNI News in the March interview. “[We’re] going down about five platforms to accommodate the height of the missile which is significantly larger than other missiles in the inventory.”

According to a statement released by the Department of Defense the Common-Hypersonic Glide Body or C-HGB was launched and traveled at hypersonic speed to “a targeted impact point.”

It was revealed that the weapon’s warhead guidance system cabling and thermal protection shield would all be included in the C-HGB. Each service will build weapon systems such as launchers that can fire weapons from land or sea using the C-HGB as a base.

US Navy Going Hypersonic

The US’ Long Range Hypersonic Weapons are a direct response to rival nations’ hypersonic missiles some of which are mounted on land-based wheeled Transporter Erector Launchers (TELs) inside VLS tubes on warships or carried beneath bombers and vary in diameter weight and dimensions like the Chinese hypersonic YJ-21 anti-ship Ballistic Missile.

The Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) of the United States Army and the CPS of the Navy are the same missiles according to Naval News. The US Navy said it must deploy an air-launched air-breathing hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile by 2028. The service claims this weapon will be essential in fending off growing threats from potential enemies like China and Russia.

In the previously released documents associated with the Navy’s budget proposal for the fiscal year 2023 the Hypersonic Air-Launched Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare Missile or HALO is extensively discussed.

The US Navy has also been directly involved in at least one experimental air-launched hypersonic missile program directed by the United States Air Force and performed under the aegis of the Pentagon’s Joint Hypersonic Transition Office.

The Navy plans to deploy the weapons on destroyers by 2025 and Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines by 2028.

Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday said last year that the Zumwalts would be the first platform to field hypersonics ahead of the planned inclusion of the weapons on the submarine force.

“Zumwalt gave us an opportunity to get [hypersonics] out faster and to be honest with you I need a solid mission for Zumwalt” Gilday told USNI News during an interview earlier this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

DCM Data Products though a part of a large industrial group operated like a startup from a garage and spawned new firms most notably Hindustan Computers Limited (HCL) founded by Shiv Nadar and others. Narendra Patni who conceived the idea of shipping data conversion work from America to India in what later came to be recognised as offshoring founded Patni Computer Systems which in turn nurtured a group of young programmers led by N R Narayana Murthy. This group broke off and formed Infosys. Azim Premji scion of the Western India Products Limited branched off to form Wipro Information Technology Limited which was incubated at the Indian Institute of Science. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) expanded its business with the Tatas also teaming with Burroughs. All these firms benefited from the vast Indian market which was looking to shift from mainframes and data processing to mini and microcomputers after the exit of IBM in 1978. Software services exports in the form of on-site development also began in a modest way by the end of the 1970s.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYWRnZXRzbm93LmNvbS9zbGlkZXNob3dzL3R3aXR0ZXItYWRvYmUtZ29vZ2xlLWFuZC0xMy1vdGhlci10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWNvbXBhbmllcy1oZWFkZWQtYnktaW5kaWFuLW9yaWdpbi1jZW9zL3Bob3RvbGlzdC84ODAwODc1MC5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FkZ2V0c25vdy5jb20vYW1wL3NsaWRlc2hvd3MvdHdpdHRlci1hZG9iZS1nb29nbGUtYW5kLTEzLW90aGVyLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktY29tcGFuaWVzLWhlYWRlZC1ieS1pbmRpYW4tb3JpZ2luLWNlb3MvcGhvdG9saXN0Lzg4MDA4NzUwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Google and 16 other technology giants headed by Indian-origin executives,"Microsoft Google and 16 other technology giants headed by Indian-origin executives

To replace it all DirectX 9 support will be transferred to DirectX 12 in the form of emulation.

Emulation will run on an open-source conversion layer known as ""D3D9On12"" from Microsoft. Conversion works by sending 3D DirectX 9 graphics commands to the D3D9On12 layer instead of the D3D9 graphics driver directly. Once the D3D9On12 layer receives commands from the D3D9 API it will convert all commands into D3D12 API calls. So basically D3D9On12 will act as a GPU driver all on its own instead of the actual GPU driver from Intel.

Microsoft says this emulation process has become a relatively performant implementation of DirectX 9. As a result performance should be nearly as good if not just as good as native DirectX 9 hardware support.

This DX9 change from Intel appears to be a very good move as a result. Intel can now divert driver development resources towards DirectX 11 optimizations -- which we know is very bad at this time and Intel won't suffer performance consequences as a result with DX9 optimizations ""outsourced"" to Microsoft entirely.

According to Microsoft with how performant D3D9On12 is it will be interesting to see if Nvidia and AMD follow the same path as Intel. But there could be consequences to the API translation including higher CPU usage (since the translation is software accelerated) and potential side-effects with older games. Nvidia and AMD also have almost 20 years of driver experience with DirectX 9 which might result in performance losses with the DX12 emulation layer.

Intel on the contrary only has experience with DirectX 9 on its integrated graphics which does not translate into the experience with its much higher-performing discrete graphics. So it makes a lot of sense that Intel is immediately transitioning to emulation as it gets closer to launching Arc worldwide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvaW50ZWwtYXJjLWlzLXN0aWxsLWRvb21lZC1hbmQtdGhpcy1jb3VsZC1iZS10aGlzLWZpbmFsLW5haWwtaW4tdGhlLWNvZmZpbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Arc is still doomed and this could be the final nail in the coffin,"Oh Intel Arc you were supposed to be something special. I remember first hearing about Intel’s big plans for entering the discrete GPU market back when I was but a fresh-faced freelancer breaking into tech journalism. It was exciting: finally a third major player in the graphics card game something to light a fire underneath Nvidia and AMD driving competition and innovation. You were the Chosen One Arc.

But like Obi-Wan leaving his scorched mentee beside a river of lava I have to walk away. I’ve wanted Intel Arc to be good for so long and now it’s finally here and I feel nothing but hollow disappointment. I’m not angry with Intel; the tech giant could never have foreseen the devastation that COVID would wreak on its big GPU plans. But it sucks and the news I read today only crystallized that downfall.

Yes there’s more bad news on the Arc front just days after I penned this article about how Intel GPU venture was on the back foot before the fight even began. Long-standing graphics market analysis firm Jon Peddie Research recently published an editorial on the state of AXG Intel’s Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group. Spoiler alert: it’s not good.

Will Gelsinger put Arc out of its misery?

Jon Peddie’s report began by highlighting just how much Intel has cut costs in recent years. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has demonstrated that he’s willing to kill off projects that don’t turn a profit from Optane to the firm’s ill-fated drone department. Intel’s most recent financial report confirmed that the Arc project has cost it $2.1 billion which would put it squarely on Gelsinger’s chopping block.

It gets worse. Peddie’s analysis estimated that the actual figure could be closer to $3.5 billion or more - a staggering amount of money for Intel to lose and with very little to show for it. The delays were bad enough but for Arc to struggle upon release even after years of preparation was nothing short of a disaster.

Quiet releases in Asian markets (mostly in pre-built PCs and laptops with very few discrete desktop GPUs going on sale) didn’t really help. With little to no fanfare a lot of consumers have either found it hard to care about Arc or missed the boat entirely and aren’t even aware of it. The news that one of Intel’s laptop production partners (as of yet unnamed) was dropping the project did nothing to help matters.

Intel has clearly been running damage control with chief architect Raja Koduri frequently taking to Twitter to assuage people’s concerns and assure them that yes Arc is coming for real and it’ll be good. They even released a video showcasing the Arc A750 (which is not yet available to consumers) just barely outperforming Nvidia’s RTX 3060 on average across almost 50 games.

Where do we go from here?

Beating the eighteen-month-old RTX 3060 isn’t going to be enough and all the ersatz laughter in that YouTube clip won’t convince me. Let’s face it: RTX 4000 will be here before long AMD’s next-gen GPUs too and when that happens Intel is in serious trouble.

There are some small (very small) glimmers of hope; if Intel sells off its AXG arm in line with Peddie’s recommendation there’s a chance it could be secured by a firm other than AMD and Nvidia potentially creating new competition for the two GPU giants. If they decide to keep it the recently-announced Arc Pro A-series GPUs might see Intel’s discrete graphics tech find a home in workstations and laptops for business.

I won’t hold my breath though. With everything that’s gone wrong I agree with Jon Peddie; Intel should cut its losses and put the Arc program to bed. Focusing on integrated graphics looks like a smarter move right now to counter AMD’s push for CPU graphics and Apple’s mighty M1 and M2 chips .

When you look at what modern game consoles can do with AMD processors and no discrete graphics it makes you wonder how much longer dedicated GPUs will be around. I hate to say it but this might be exactly the right time for Intel to drop the bag and run. Whether Team Blue will do that remains to be seen; their messaging right now certainly makes it seem like they’re committed to the bit but at this point? I really hope they’re not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2lzcmFlbGktaW50ZWwtaXJhbi1taXNzaWxlcy10cnVtcHMtaGlzdG9yeS1vZi1wbGF5aW5nLWxvb3NlLXdpdGgtY2xhc3NpZmllZC1pbmZvL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2lzcmFlbGktaW50ZWwtaXJhbi1taXNzaWxlcy10cnVtcHMtaGlzdG9yeS1vZi1wbGF5aW5nLWxvb3NlLXdpdGgtY2xhc3NpZmllZC1pbmZvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Israeli intel Iran missiles: Trump’s history of playing loose with classified info,"AFP — Court documents unsealed Friday showed that FBI agents retrieved a number of highly classified documents in a raid on former US president Donald Trump’s Florida home.

The raid was just the most recent episode in which the former American leader was accused of playing loose with and abusing classified information.

Iranian missile site

As president Trump had the power to unilaterally declassify information. But some of his actions stunned the US intelligence community nonetheless.

On August 30 2019 he tweeted what was believed to be a classified high-resolution image of an Iranian rocket launch site.

“The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir [Space Launch Vehicle] Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran” Trump said.

Israeli intelligence

On May 10 2017 Trump met Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the White House Oval Office.

In the meeting Trump told the two Russians about intelligence the United States had received from a Middle East ally about an Islamic State plot.

The highly classified intelligence it turned out came from Israel which was upset by the disclosure according to foreign media reports.

Location of nuclear subs

In April 2017 Trump told Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte that two US nuclear submarines were off the coast of North Korea boasting of “a lot of firepower” according to a Philippines transcript of their call.

The Pentagon only very rarely discloses the location of its submarines which are crucial to the US strategic defense force.

Secret nuclear weapons

In a 2019 interview Trump told writer Bob Woodward about an unknown US nuclear capability that may have been a specious boast or divulged highly secret information.

“I have built a nuclear a weapons system that nobody’s ever had in this country before” Trump told Woodward.

“We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before” he added.

Details of Special Forces raid

After a US operation killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria in October 2019 Trump boasting of the attack revealed numerous details that the Pentagon would normally withhold like how many helicopters were involved how the commandos entered the residence and that the US had intelligence from Islamic State use of phones and internet.

The information “could contribute to a reverse engineering of our intelligence methods by the adversary” former special operations commander Michael Nagata told Politico.

Secrecy with Putin

Trump also withheld intelligence from his spy chiefs. In July 2018 Dan Coats the director of national intelligence was visibly surprised at the Aspen Security Forum when the host told him the White House had tweeted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to visit Washington.

“Say that again?” Coats said.

A year later Coats said he was in the dark about what Trump discussed in a two-hour one-on-one meeting with the wily Russian leader three days earlier.

“I don’t know what happened in that meeting” Coats said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvMjUxMy1pbnRlbC1hcmMtYTM4MC12cy1hbWQtcmFkZW9uLTY0MDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Arc 3 A380 vs. AMD Radeon RX 6400,"Today we're taking another look at Intel Arc 3 A380 but this time with a 51 game benchmark head to head against AMD's $150 Radeon RX 6400. This will give us a better idea of how the Arc A380 performs across a wide range of titles and – spoiler alert – it wasn't all smooth sailing but there were some positive signs as well it's a very mixed bag and we're keen to show you the results.

If you missed it earlier we covered the A380 for the first time about 2 weeks ago with our standard review format which looked at performance in a dozen games compared it with a range of other budget GPUs while also evaluating power consumption and thermals.

The aim for this comparison is to take that testing a big step further with a 51 game benchmark covering 1080p and 900p (1600x900) resolutions using dialed down quality settings. At some point we might also look at overclocking performance as a lot of you have requested but first we wanted to prioritize stock performance to get a clear baseline for how the Intel Arc 3 A380 performs.

As of writing Intel has yet to release the A380 outside of China so for most gamers this is still an unreleased product. But this is less about buying advice and more just taking a look at what's going on with the first Intel Arc GPU which is targeting the entry-level market.

For testing we're using our Ryzen 7 5800X3D GPU test system and yes we know no one is going to pair a budget graphics card with this CPU but the point is to test pure GPU performance while avoiding to introduce a CPU bottleneck which would skew the data.

For low-end to entry-level graphics testing we typically use medium quality settings in games or settings that make sense for a given title. Also please note for this testing both the A380 and RX 6400 were tested exclusively with Resizable BAR enabled. As we found in our original A380 review ReBAR is mandatory for this product as performance is simply horrible without it.

On the drivers front we're using AMD's Adrenalin Edition 22.7.1 and Intel Graphics Driver 30.0.101.1743. As mentioned before benchmarks were run at 1080p and 900p and we'll go over about a dozen or so titles individually before getting into the 51 game breakdown graphs.

Gaming Benchmarks

Starting with Death Stranding we find comparable performance between these two GPUs which is not a bad result for the A380 if it ends up costing ~$50 less than the Radeon 6400.

At 900p the Intel GPU was 3% faster and then at 1080p the average frame rate performance was much the same though the A380 did offer 20% stronger 1% lows.

The A380 was incredible relative to the Radeon 6400 in Hitman 3 delivering over 70% more performance at both tested resolutions. The game was noticeably smoother and much more enjoyable with the Arc GPU hitting 77 fps at 900p and just shy of 60 fps at 1080p while the RX 6400 was good for just 34 fps.

Quite a remarkable result here and while we did see other similar examples I regret to inform you that they were few and far between...

Another great showing for the Intel A380 was The Division 2 where it was 64% faster than the Radeon 6400 at 1080p taking the average frame rate from a laggy 45 fps to a rather smooth 74 fps with 1% lows of 62 fps.

The experience using the Arc GPU was worlds better and it's a shame we didn't see more of this.

Wolfenstein: Youngblood was another successful title for the Arc GPU. Both the A380 and RX 6400 performed very well at 900p with over 100 fps on average though the Radeon GPU did end up coming out on top by a 10% margin.

However we were able to use the 'Ultra' quality preset and this gave the A380 and its larger 6GB VRAM buffer an advantage at 1080p allowing it to pull ahead by a 36% margin to deliver a very respectable 75fps on average.

We hit our first road block with the A380 when trying to fire up Dirt 5 which flat out just doesn't work with the Intel GPU the game won't even load you just get served an error message.

Obviously that's an unfortunate software issue but it's also a shame as this modern title runs very well on lower end hardware using modest quality settings and as such is highly playable using the RX 6400.

Next we have Apex Legends and here the A380 was competitive with the Radeon 6400 trailing it by just a few frames and that means both were good for over 90 fps at 1080p. A good result for the A380 especially if it does end up being cheaper than the RX 6400.

It's a similar story in F1 22 here the A380 was 10% slower at 1080p which isn't too bad though the 16% margin it trailed by a 900p is starting to get up there and for those with high refresh rate monitors you'll certainly notice the difference here.

Battlefield V ran much better using the Radeon GPU at 900p the A380 was 15% slower when looking at the average frame rate and 20% slower for the 1% lows.

The margins did close up at 1080p but even then the Intel GPU was 10% slower. Overall the game was playable but you'd rather play it with the RX 6400 if you had a choice.

We've heard how Intel has prioritized support for new APIs such as DirectX 12 and Vulkan so perhaps these results shouldn't come as a surprise. Still CSGO is a wildly popular game so these results are going to be a complete and utter deal breaker for a good many of you.

You're looking at more than twice the performance with the Radeon 6400 in CSGO versus the Intel A380...

You're looking at more than twice the performance with the Radeon 6400 and while the A380 still looks very playable stability was a real concern here.

Twice during our testing the game crashed to desktop and that's not something that has ever happened with a Radeon GPU at least not in the last few years of benchmarking with this title. Intel has a lot of driver work to do here still.

Another title where the Intel A380 struggled was Fortnite. Granted these frame rates are playable but they're less than ideal for a competitive shooter and what we received from the Radeon 6400 was significantly more impressive and far more desirable for those of you rocking a high refresh rate monitor.

Halo Infinite using the lowest quality settings saw the A380 fail to hit 60 fps even at 900p so performance overall was disappointing especially considering that at 1080p the Radeon 6400 was almost 40% faster.

Moving on to Red Dead Redemption 2 where we ran into more driver related issues. This time the Vulkan API caused crashes it was possible to run our benchmark but it did take a number of passes to get the results basically the game was completely unstable.

However DirectX 12 appeared to run without issue so the A380 was benchmarked using DX12 while the RX 6400 was tested using Vulkan. The end result being a 26% performance advantage for the Radeon at 900p and 22% at 1080p.

The God of War experience with the A380 was interesting because at first we thought this was going to be another non-starter. The game did load but the initial menus were extremely slow and almost impossible to navigate but once we managed to hit the 'continue' button the game loaded and was quite playable.

Like with CSGO we did experience a few crashes while testing so although we managed to gather our results they're only for reference given the stability issues.

In World War Z Aftermath we ran into more issues. For some reason it wasn't possible to use Vulkan in this title either. We could only run with DX11 and while the game ran fine it would crash on exit and hang the entire system for 30-60 seconds so that was fun.

This all means that the Radeon 6400 was tested using Vulkan while we ran the A380 using DirectX 11. The performance was horrible especially relative to the RX 6400 which offered over twice the performance.

Far Cry 6 also suffered from a menu bug which resulted in very slow navigation making it difficult to change settings or even get into the game. That aside the game didn't crash at least during our testing and performance overall was decent. This was one of the stronger results for the A380.

Performance Summary

We've looked at the individual results of 15 of the 51 games tested now it's time to see how the Arc 3 A380 and Radeon RX 6400 compare in all 51 games at 900p and 1080p...

Starting with the 900p data we see how much of a mixed bag the Arc 3 A380 is and sadly it's a bit more ""bad"" than it is ""good."" As seen earlier the A380 showed impressive returns in a handful of games including Hitman 3 The Division 2 Doom Eternal Rainbow Six Extraction and Metro Exodus...

In 7 of the games tested performance was highly competitive with margins within 5%. Unfortunately though 14 of the games saw the A380 trail by a 20% margin or greater with most seeing a 10% or larger margin for an 11% difference on average.

Of course these results omit Dirt 5 where the A380 failed to launch while games such as God of War and CSGO suffered stability issues.

The margin at 1080p moves slightly in favor of the Intel A380 where it was 7% slower on average. But again that doesn't give us the full picture as we're looking at a mixed bag of results and that's ignoring the titles that either didn't run or had some kind of game breaking issue.

What We Learned

We have to admit the Intel Arc 3 A380 didn't perform as poorly as we had expected in this 51 game benchmark but that's not to say the experience was good overall. There were a few titles where the experience was great and many where it was just decent but there were many where the performance was horrible or stability was a problem or even both.

There's also two sides to Intel driver problem... first there's game support which we've just tested and clearly there's a lot of work remaining to improve performance compatibility and stability. The other side of the driver equation is the control utility or Intel's version of Nvidia's GeForce Experience or AMD's Adrenalin software.

Intel's Arc Control is horrible with so many issues we simply can't cover them all in this review. It would require its own dedicated space case in point that's what Gamers Nexus did with a video titled ""Worst We've Tested: Broken Intel Arc GPU Drivers"" and we can confirm we've experienced almost all of the issues discussed there. So it's broken and Intel has a mountain of work ahead of them especially if they plan to release Arc later this year in ""official capacity.""

It's also worth noting that the Radeon RX 6400 is a truly terrible product so we've intentionally set the bar extremely low for Intel at the entry-level. Right now the RX 6400 costs at least $150 and is only a justifiable purchase for those who require a single-slot low-profile graphics card. Outside of that you're either best off saving up for an Radeon RX 6600 or shopping second hand.

In our A380 review we said we'd be tempted to roll the dice on the A380 in the hope that Intel comes through with the driver support but after spending more time with it we're not so confident about willing to take that bet. With half decent drivers it would be a much better product than the Radeon 6400 but if and when they'll get there is hard to say.

Put in a situation where we required an entry-level graphics card we think we'd take to eBay or a similar site in search of a second hand GeForce GTX 1650 Radeon RX 580 or something along those lines. We really hope Intel can turn things around but it's going to take some major changes and we're not sure Intel is capable of that. Only time will tell.

Jay Hottinger R-Newark visited Intel Corporation facilities in Israel on an Ohio Senate delegation with Ohio Jewish communities and left the Middle East with a greater appreciation of both Intel and Israel.

Hottinger scheduled to return to Ohio on Sunday after the week-long visit to Israel toured Intel facilities there on Thursday. Seven other Ohio senators joined Hottinger on the Ohio Senate-Israeli trade mission.

“I felt real good about Intel before my visit here just and it just reinforced that it’s going to be great for Licking County and Ohio"" Hottinger said Thursday from Jerusalem.

“The purpose was for us to come see the opportunities here and to open up a dialogue on partnerships. Ohio is a big partner with Israel. We have a lot of Ohio companies with a presence in Israel.”

The flight into Israel was temporarily delayed after missiles were fired into the country from the Gaza Strip. Reuters reported Palestinian militants in Gaza fired dozens of rockets into Israel in response to Israeli airstrikes which killed at least 10 people including a senior commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement.

Despite the missiles fired into Israel on the day of the delegation's departure from Ohio Hottinger said he felt safe because the country's Iron Dome anti-missile system has a 97.7% accuracy of shooting down incoming missiles. There were a couple injuries but no deaths in Israel.

“I feel incredibly safe here” Hottinger said. “They live in a kind of hostile neighborhood.”

Within Israel however the diversity and acceptance of others is remarkable he said.

“A lot of communities here are mixed communities of Israeli Arabs and Israeli Jews” Hottinger said. “They get along for the most part. Almost all want peace. It’s just some of the extremist groups (who don’t).”

Israel ranked among the top 10 most technologically advanced countries has four Intel sites including the company’s most advanced manufacturing facility in the city of Kiryat Gat. The company first came to Israel in 1974.

In Jerusalem where Hottinger visited is Intel’s global development center of autonomous cars and development center for communication and cyber security solutions.

The company’s development center of hardware and software for processors and artificial intelligence is located in Haifa. The development center for communication and artificial intelligence solutions is located in Petah Tikvah.

“Intel was really the first of the tech companies to come here and now that’s what Israel is known for"" Hottinger said. ""Intel is not noticed because there’s so many companies here.”

Since 1974 Intel has grown from five employees to 12000 in Israel. There are 7000 in development and 5000 in manufacturing.

Not only does Intel attract suppliers and other companies it also attracts housing Hottinger said.

“Their first location in Israel they built houses and people wanted to be right across from their fabs and it was the same thing in Arizona” Hottinger said. “Wherever there is Intel they create an economy around it.”

Hottinger said there will be 30 to 40 Intel suppliers coming to Ohio and there are already conversations with 15 of them to come to central Ohio.

Intel begins construction this year on the largest commercial development in Ohio history a $20 billion computer chip manufacturing operation which could grow to a $100 billion investment just south of Johnstown on Jersey Township land annexed into New Albany.

The company expects production to start in 2025 and employment to reach 3000 with an average wage of $135000. The project is also expected to create 7000 construction jobs and 10000 indirect jobs.

Hottinger said Intel is a good neighbor providing scholarships and partnering with schools.

“Being that great corporate citizen they do this across the world"" Hottinger said. ""There’s always going to be naysayers and skeptics but they’re phenomenally great corporate neighbors.”

Iran’s government and top officials have not reacted to the attack in New York on Friday. While the hardliner media have welcomed the move implicitly or even openly praising the assailant. Kayhan daily linked to the Supreme Leader for instance on Saturday said “a thousand bravos” to the man who attacked Rushdie implying that his throat should have been cut. In its Sunday edition the paper said “divine vengeance befell Salma Rushdie” and predicted that former US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are next.

Some Iranian media and political figures have adopted a different tact accusing opponents of the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal of using the attack on Salman Rushdie as a means of sabotaging a possible nuclear agreement.

Proponents of the conspiracy theory claim there is a possible involvement of Iran’s opponents particularly Israel who want to discredit the Iranian government and sabotage agreement on the revival of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and lifting of US sanctions.

Hardliner Mohammad Marandi who has acted as a spokesman-cum-advisor of the Iranian negotiators in Vienna nuclear talks tweeted that he would not be shedding tears “for a writer who spouts hatred and contempt for Muslims and Islam” but went on to ask if it “isn’t odd that as we near a potential nuclear deal the US makes claims about a hit on Bolton... and then this happens?”

A picture showing Lebanon's Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in the town of Yaroun southern Lebanon from where the family of Hadi Matar emigrated to the US August 13 2022.

“I'm not an exponent of conspiracy theories but simultaneousness of the news about plans to assassinate [John] Bolton and the attack on Rushdie with the finalization of talks to restore the JCPOA isn’t not credible to me” reformist' politician and commentator Abbas Abdi who is an ardent critic of the Raisi government tweeted.

It is quite possible that the recent ‘plots’ against US officials and citizen as well as Rushdie were organized by the Israeli intelligence to prevent diplomatic solutions to the disputes between Tehran and Washington Reza Nasri a commentaor said in a tweet while in a commentary Saturday the conservative Alef news website said the West would devise ‘propaganda scenarios’ against Iran revolving around the attack on Rushdie.

Others on social media have seen these statements as an attempt by Iran to create confusion to deflect blame for a death fatwa issued 34 years ago against Rushdie that could have led to the Friday knife attack.

The 15 Khordad Foundation a charity organization that put the multi-million-dollar bounty on Rushdie’s head in 1989 and even increased it by half a million to $3.3 million in 2012 has so far remained silent about the assassination attempt.

Hadi Matar (24) the suspect in the stabbing of Rushdie at an event in New York state has now been charged with attempted murder and is being held without bond prosecutors in Chautauqua County said on Saturday.

A preliminary law enforcement review of Matar's social media accounts showed he was sympathetic to Shi'ite extremism and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) although no definitive links had been found according to NBC New York.

In the US Republicans have demanded that the Biden administration must put an end to negotiations with Iran in view of the terrorist act against Rushdie sanctioned by Khomeini's fatwa as well as the alleged recent Iranian plots against US officials and citizens including John Bolton Mark Pompeo and Masih Alinejad an Iranian American activist.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wb3N0c3Rhci9uYW1lL2ZyYW5jaXMtYnV0bGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MjMwMDYx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Francis Butler Obituary (1929 - 2022) - Corinth NY - Post-Star,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/poststar/name/francis-butler-obituary?id=36230061 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wb3N0c3Rhci9uYW1lL2ZyYW5jaXMtYnV0bGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MjMwMDYx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW53b3JsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9wYXBlci1tb25leS9wb3J0YWxzLWRlLWxhLXJ1ZS1yZWFjaC1zZXR0bGVtZW50LW92ZXItcGFwZXItY29udHJhY3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Portals De La Rue reach settlement over paper contract,"Portals is a historic English paper making business that was founded in 1711 and which operated under various versions of that name for more than 300 years. Shown is a screenshot of the Portals timeline from the company website.

Portals is a historic English paper making business that was founded in 1711 and which operated under various versions of that name for more than 300 years.

The company opened one of its paper mills Overton Mills in Hampshire in 1922. In 1995 Portals was acquired by bank note printer De La Rue which ran it until 2018 when De La Rue divested itself of the security paper manufacturer and it once again began operating as an independent business under the Portals name.

As part of the 2018 divestiture agreement De La Rue retained a 10% stake in a management buyout of the new company and secured a 10-year paper supply contract for De La Rue’s printing requirements making it Portals' biggest customer. The agreement called for De La Rue to buy bank note proofing and security paper from Portals subject to a minimum annual volume guarantee and Portals to purchase security features from De La Rue with no guarantee of volume.

Recent years have seen De La Rue shift its emphasis to polymer rather than paper for its bank notes even as it encountered a series of financial difficulties including losing the contract to print British passports. The printer now says the guaranteed volume is not obtainable and things will only get worse over the duration of the contract. It announced a settlement agreement with Portals on July 26 that gets it out of the contract and puts 300 people at Overton Mills out of work.

De La Rue would have had to pay Portals about £364.2 million or $440 million over the remaining five years and eight months of the contract a figure that includes the anticipated costs of paper manufacture and fixed charges. Without paper charges it would be £119 million. Instead it will pay £16.7 million in cash to terminate the contract £1.7 million on or before Dec. 31 2022 £7.5 million on or before Jan. 6 2023 and £7.5 million on or before April 7 2023.

Under the agreement De La Rue will be free to purchase bank note and security paper from any supplier worldwide.

Portals said in a statement to the BBC “Following the global pandemic and other recent world events we have seen a significant adverse impact on our banknote paper business.”

“It is also clear that the change in the strategy of our largest customer De La Rue plc and the rising input costs specifically of energy all in the context of the highly price competitive banknote paper marketplace in which we operate means that our banknote paper business at Overton is no longer viable.”

Following its announcement about an inquiry Qualitative Research published by Sage Journals removed the paper altogether. An updated notice on the paper’s webpage says “Due to ethical concerns surrounding this article and the social harm being caused by the publication of this work the publishers have now agreed with the journal editors and have decided to remove the article while this investigation is ongoing in accordance with [Committee on Publication Ethics] guidelines.”

The article first published earlier this year has elicited public expressions of disbelief eye rolls and jokes about taking so-called intellectual masturbation to the extreme. Some readers also have wondered if the paper is a hoax similar to a set of phony articles on gender from several years ago (the authors of those papers said their project was designed to root out political bias in publishing).

Yet the new masturbation article written by Karl Andersson a Ph.D. candidate in Japanese studies at Manchester—who did not respond to requests for comment—appears to be genuine.

His dissertation adviser Sharon Kinsella of Manchester whom Andersson includes in his acknowledgments also did not respond to a request for comment.

Beyond just shock the paper has been denounced as bad scholarship in part because Andersson effectively presents himself as an autoethnographer incorporating his own experiences into his research without discussing his positionality—his various identities in relation to the subculture he’s exploring. Crucially Andersson doesn’t mention that he is a white European man even though he says he’s using masturbation to better understand readers of a specific genre of sexually explicit Japanese comics.

Andersson’s paper has raised even graver concerns about publishing standards and ethics as the comics in which Andersson is interested feature underage characters. And in one case per Andersson’s retelling the material features a sexual encounter between two characters during which one of the two repeatedly verbally objects.

While Andersson is a Ph.D. student he didn’t stumble into complex ethical terrain. He’s pursued these topics—albeit outside academe—for over a decade.

According to Vice and other sources Andersson published Destroyer—Journal of Apollonian Beauty and Dionysian Sexuality which he later wrote a book about from 2006 to 2010. Both Destroyer and a website Andersson ran included sexually suggestive depictions of boys and were controversial in Andersson’s native Sweden and elsewhere. (Andersson has argued that no one under 18 was pictured nude.)

Andersson told Vice in 2012 that he also was publishing sexually explicit Japanese comics with two artists saying that “Shotacon manga are comics where boys have sex either with each other or with older boys or men. What I like about shotacon manga is that it’s an extreme fantasy.” He said in that interview that he’d been denounced for sexualizing children but that “teenage boys aren’t children but are in fact sexual—something I enhanced in my magazine which was a tribute to the teenage boy. What is it anyways to ‘sexualize children’ and what’s bad about it? It’s not a real argument.”

This history isn’t mentioned in Andersson’s new paper his first academic publication called “I Am Not Alone—We Are All Alone: Using Masturbation as an Ethnographic Method in Research on Shota Subculture in Japan.”

An Experimental Method?

“I wanted to understand how my research participants experience sexual pleasure when reading shota a Japanese genre of self-published erotic comics that features young boy characters” Andersson wrote in the abstract to the new paper. “I therefore started reading the comics in the same way as my research participants had told me that they did it: while masturbating.”

Andersson goes on to frame masturbating to shota comics as an experimental method saying his “participant observation of my own desire not only gave me a more embodied understanding of the topic for my research but also made me think about loneliness and ways to combat it as driving forces of the culture of self-published erotic comics.”

Quoting the late Audre Lorde—“The erotic cannot be felt secondhand”—Andersson makes one of several sexual puns: “I realized that my body was equipped with a research tool of its own that could give me quite literally a first-hand understanding of shota” (emphasis Andersson’s).

Social scientists have long studied sex and even masturbation though rarely their own experiences. There are exceptions including a 2012 article by Kristen C. Blinne called “Auto(erotic)ethnography.” Yet Andersson says in his paper that Blinne’s own “poetic style ironically reinforces the idea that masturbation is a sensitive enough subject to warrant special linguistic treatment.”

Andersson’s approach is more straightforward: “I would masturbate in the same way that my research participants did it. After each masturbation session I would write down my thoughts and feelings—a kind of critical self-reflection—in a notebook as well as details about which material I had used where I had done it at what time and for how long. I would not be allowed to have any other sexual relief during this ‘fieldwork’ in my own sexuality: no regular porn no sex with another person no fantasies or memories—it had to be shota every time. I happened to live alone during this experiment and I had newly become single after a long relationship—these factors probably contributed to my willingness and eagerness to explore this method.”

Findings—and Questions

Following three months of this “fieldwork” Andersson wrote that “Thinking more critically about my own masturbation also made me wonder if all sex is masturbation in the sense that people are focused on their own pleasure and use other people as ‘masturbation material.’”

At the same time he concludes “we are not alone. When we masturbate someone else is always there. During this fieldwork others were there with me both in the form of the characters that populated the d’’ojinshi [comics] but also in the form of the invisible creator of these characters and the other readers who were enjoying them. In addition my head was visited by people from my past people I had seen on the street my ex-partner.”

Andersson shares two entries from his diaries. One of them describes material that appears to involve consensual activity between boys. But the other example involves material depicting a sexual encounter between two characters in which one of them is repeatedly verbally objecting saying “I’m not homo!”

Andersson does not address the issue of consent saying only “as I stroked myself to orgasm Shigeru’s story mixed with my own tweaking my past and providing me ‘a happier version’ as one of my research participants had put it. This is not to say that things like those in the d’’ojinshi necessarily should have happened when I grew up. But to enjoy this alternative version for half an hour in the comfort of my bed felt good.”

Nor does Andersson address the issue of adults reading explicit material about underage characters beyond this: “Several of my research participants had used the word ‘nostalgia’ to describe the allure of shota. This too looks back at the past and the period of puberty that is captured by the term ‘growth’ which is a common theme in shota.”

The editors of Qualitative Research released an initial statement last week announcing their investigation of the paper. Asked for more details about the scope of the inquiry Editor in Chief Kate Moles senior lecturer in sociology at Cardiff University in Wales forwarded the same statement: “We are continuing with our investigations and will consider closely all guidance from the Committee of Publication Ethics and ensure that any actions taken comply with COPE standards.”

The University of Manchester said in its own statement “The recent publication in Qualitative Research of the work of a student now registered for a Ph.D. has raised significant concerns and complaints which we are taking very seriously. We are currently undertaking a detailed investigation into all aspects of their work the processes around it and other questions raised. It is very important that we look at the issues in-depth. While that investigation is ongoing it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this time.”

Ethics Landscape

Manchester’s guidance on university ethical approval lists five possible routes for review starting with a division- or school-level review for “low-risk” student projects only. Among other reasons ethical approval is said to be required for projects involving “social sensitive topics.”

Sometimes university institutional review boards which oversee research involving human subjects require approval for research on oneself. It’s unclear what if any kind of approval Andersson sought or obtained for his new paper. However he said in a June YouTube video that a separate fieldwork project he proposed—presumably one involving human subjects—failed ethical review.

“This means that there will be a big delay in my fieldwork which is sad but ethics are of course paramount to any research” he says in the recording which does not include details about the fieldwork.

Asked about ethical issues that might be relevant to the pending reviews Deborah Poff past chair and trustee of COPE said via email that the international publications committee “has a subcommittee right now looking at editorial responsibility with respect to topics or issues which people might consider offensive discriminatory etc. Unfortunately we haven’t drafted any guidelines on this yet. There have been a few well known cases where articles published were challenged as requiring retractions by editors because they were sexist racist sexually offensive etc.”

Elizabeth Chin professor of media design practices and at ArtCenter College of Design in California and editor in chief of American Anthropologist said there are “all sorts of great and rigorous reasons” to use ethnography or autoethnography to study sexuality gender fetishism and yes masturbation.

Even so she said Andersson’s paper is a “trash fire.”

“The topic is not the point” Chin said. “In my very quick read the argumentation and methodology do not rise to the level of publishability.” (Chin said she never would have sent the paper out for review in her capacity as a journal editor.)

More specifically Chin said the “lack of critically engaged conversation about the author’s own sexuality race and subject position is a huge problem especially for an autoethnography and then even more so for a white guy doing work among Japanese.”

“There seems to be some added problematics from the author’s past” Chin added arguing that Andersson should have disclosed his own views on pederasty including whether they’ve changed since his Destroyer days.

Regarding Andersson’s whiteness Chin said there’s “no dearth of research on the ways in which Asian sexualities have been constructed as subordinate consumable et cetera by whiteness writ large.” (She argued that Andersson could have drawn on scholarship on the construction of Asian masculinities in particular.) Instead Chin continued “The piece reads as if he went out and found one easy-to-grab reference for this point or that one rather than having a well-honed argument that engages ongoing disciplinary discussions of importance in a given area or field.”

Per this point Erica Kanesaka an assistant professor of English at Emory University who studies race sex and gender in Japan and the U.S. and one of many scholars to tweet critically about Andersson’s paper told Inside Higher Ed “The article reflects longstanding Orientalist attitudes related to Japan’s infantilization and hypersexualization in the Western imagination.”

While Chin called herself a committed autoethnographer she also bristled at the “sort of substitution of self for the research subject” in Andersson’s paper (a highly unusual approach) especially as he reveals so little about his identity.

Even in a best-case scenario it will likely take years to get a new free system up and running. There’s also pushback from commercial tax preparation companies which question whether Americans want the IRS to prepare their taxes.

Perhaps this biggest hurdle is an agreement between the IRS and some commercial tax preparation companies known as the Free File Alliance which prevents the federal agency from creating its own free tax return filing system. In short the IRS agreed not create its own filing system if companies would instead provide free services to taxpayers making $73000 or less.

This program though has been marred with controversy with commercial firms misrepresenting their services and low taxpayer participation rates.

The Government Accountability Office in April reported that while 70% of taxpayers were eligible for services through the Free File Alliance only 3% of taxpayers actually use the service. The watchdog recommended the IRS find new free filing options before the Alliance expires in October 2023.

With the funding in the bill the IRS has an opportunity to create a new system.

Included is a provision that allots $15 million to the IRS to make plans for a free direct e-file tax return system. Those plans would have to be developed within nine months and would include cost estimates for creating and administering a system. They would also require public input.

There are also legislative attempts to move this effort along.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass. in July resubmitted a bill called the Tax Filing Simplification Act that would require the IRS to create its own free online tax filing service and move away from its partnership with private online tax preparation companies.

“I’ve been pushing for a free tax filing system for years and now the IRS is on the verge of having significant funding to modernize its IT systems which means it’s time to develop simplified filing tools laid out in my Tax Filing Simplification Act” Warren told The Associated Press.

“Americans spend too much time and money to file their taxes and the IRS should adopt these proposals to help millions of Americans file taxes and claim refunds.”

At her Finance Committee appearance Yellen called for a new system.

“There’s no reason in the world that a modern economy shouldn’t have a system that makes it easy for such a large group of taxpayers to file their returns” she said.

Vanessa Williamson a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center said “if the IRS moves forward with a free product it could save lower-income families the money they used to give to H&R Block or TurboTax.”

“Tax prep companies are notorious for tricking tax filers into paying for services they should be getting for free” Williamson said “so an IRS free file service would be a very welcome step that would save Americans money.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a traditional rigid surgical tool the surgeon has to reach the cancerous mass by following a straight path into the brain and risk poking through – and damaging – vital tissue” say the researchers in the press statement.

“Burgner-Kahrs envisions a day when one of her snake-like robots guided by a surgeon would be able to take a winding path around the vital tissue but still reach the precise surgical site. Previously inoperable brain tumors might suddenly become operable.”

This is no small feat and could one day revolutionize the medical industry. The researchers are even working on semi-autonomous models that could one day guide themselves.

Of course the surgeons would have to stir the robots in the right direction but the machines could use sensors to avoid obstacles on their path. The development would make surgery easier and safer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzE0LzItdGlwcy1mb3ItaW52ZXN0aW5nLWluLWJpb3RlY2gtc3RvY2tzLXdpdGgtbWFzc2l2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Tips for Investing in Biotech Stocks With High Growth Potential,"Investing in biotech stocks without any drugs on the market can be scary. These suggestions can help you make money in this high-risk sector.

The biotech industry is a strange part of the stock market in that it is highly regulated by the federal government. So a pharmaceutical company has to first prove that its drug is safe and effective via clinical trials before it's allowed to market it to doctors.

From a healthcare perspective that makes a lot of sense. But from a financial perspective it's kind of wacky. A biotech company has to spend a lot of money before it can make any money. And if the drug fails its clinical trial the company might not make any money at all.

That can be terrifying to investors. Nonetheless many biotech companies go public without profits or revenue precisely because their need for cash is so great. In the biotech world it has become normal (albeit scary) to invest in stocks that have no drugs on the market.

And in fact people can and do make money. Here are two suggestions for how I approach it. I'll use Novavax (NVAX 98.66%) and Nano-X Imaging (NNOX) as examples.

1. Spend your time researching small caps and micro caps

I had terrific success buying Novavax at $6 and $4 a share. The company was a tiny micro cap when I made my first purchases. A little over a year after I had bought my shares the price had spiked to $330 a share. It was roughly a 60-bagger for me.

One of the happy lessons I take from my Novavax experience is that it's a good idea for biotech investors to make small investments in tiny stocks with promising science. By tiny stocks I mean those that trade under $10 or have a market cap under $1 billion. You want to look for under-the-radar stocks.

The market hated Novavax when I bought my shares. The company had to do a 1-for-20 reverse-split to stay listed on the Nasdaq. In November 2019 the market cap had shrunk all the way to $106 million.

Now flash-forward to February 2021. Same company same CEO same scientists -- and it's a radically different situation. That month Novavax reported positive phase 3 data from its COVID-19 vaccine trial. And many people were calling the vaccine best-in-class.

When the stock hit $330 a share a few days later the company was valued at a cool $19 billion. And many people (including yours truly) thought Novavax stock was still undervalued given how massive the market opportunity was for COVID vaccinations and how good the company's data was.

When Novavax traded hands at $4 a share in November 2019 the market was at maximum pessimism about the shares. And when the Novavax share price hit $330 in February 2021 it was the ultimate in optimism. In both cases Novavax had zero drugs on the market.

It's dangerous buying a $19 billion biotech without any drugs on the market. I didn't buy Novavax at $330. But my family did buy shares of bluebird bio (BLUE -5.36%) at $220 a share. That was a $10 billion biotech without any drugs on the market and we watched it sink all the way down to the single digits.

So that's my first tip for investing in biotechs without any drugs on the market: When you're making an initial investment stick to the cheap stocks the micro caps and small caps with great science and great prospects. Make sure your company has enough cash to bring its top drug prospect to market.

And if you back a winner let that winner run! I didn't take any profits until Novavax stock was over $80. I took more profits at $125 and $330 and bought those shares back when the stock got a lot cheaper. But the key to my great returns were those first early purchases during Novavax's darkest days.

2. Look for moats

Biotech stocks are technology companies. I love tech stocks because they can scale very quickly and make investors a lot of money.

But what's perhaps most exciting about tech stocks is that a company might have a moat that gives it an advantage over rivals. Some moats I love include subscription to a service the razor-and-blades model and network effects.

Are there any healthcare companies with moats? Absolutely. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.32%) has a moat and Doximity (DOCS -1.64%) has a monster one. I think InMode (INMD -1.42%) has one too. I own all these healthcare stocks because they're highly profitable but also because these companies have big advantages over rivals and can scale up and up.

Finding a moat is a way to ""value"" a biotech stock even if it has no revenue or profits yet. Nano-X has a radically different X-ray machine than is available on the market now. The company's device relies upon cold-cathode technology making it a far cheaper device ($10000 to manufacture as opposed to a $1 million price tag for a high-end CAT scanner).

But the big news was the business plan. The company will give its machine away at cost or below cost (razor) and make money every time the machine is used (blades). It's this fantastic business model that reminds me of the moats in some of my most-rewarding stocks. That's why I am highly bullish on Nano-X. And for a while the market felt the same way and the stock spiked a lot higher.

Like we saw with Novavax it's common in biotech investing to see a lot of volatility and extreme shifts in valuation. And we're seeing that with Nano-X now. It's 2022 and the high-end device is still not on the market yet. Impatient investors have sold the stock sending it from a high of $90 all the way down to $9 back in April. But (and this is the important part) there's been no actual bad news from the FDA yet.

In the world of biotech investing the FDA is the biggest stumbling block and the most important issue. If Nano-X gets its device cleared by the FDA happy day. If it's blocked disaster. And the way I improve my risk-reward ratio is by adding shares when the stocks are super cheap.",,,,,,,,,

So far this year a web of companies with ties to Toronto-based Tricon Residential Inc. have bought 38 homes in Bartholomew County — including 19 in the Shadow Creek Farms neighborhood — in some cases paying around $70000 to $100000 more than the assessed value to acquire the properties according to real estate records.

The companies — each starting with the prefix “SFR JV-2” — are part of a joint venture between Tricon the Teacher Retirement System of Texas Pacific Life Insurance Co. and an undisclosed foreign investor to “assemble a portfolio of single-family rental homes” in the United States according to regulatory filings and reports from credit rating agencies.

Another group of companies with ties to Tricon starting with prefixes “SFR JV-1” and “SFR JV-HD” also have been purchasing homes in Bartholomew County.

Tricon is one of America’s biggest landlords owning about 30000 single-family rental homes in the United States. Investment fund Blackstone Group the largest owner of commercial real estate in the world is one of Tricon’s biggest investors.

Over the past two years companies linked to Tricon have bought 59 single-family homes in Bartholomew County for a total $15 million local real estate records show. During that time the companies have spent $8.2 million to acquire 33 homes in the Shadow Creek Farms neighborhood located near W. County Road 200 S. and Interstate 65.

In addition the companies have bought nine homes for $2.26 million in the Northbrook neighborhood near Columbus Municipal Airport and six others for $1.61 million in the Broadmoor neighborhood north of National Road between Central Avenue and Middle Road.

Real estate analysts say the recent influx of institutional investors in Bartholomew County’s housing market reflects a trend that has been playing out across the United States as an “unprecedented housing market” has fueled the companies’ appetite for single-family homes.

The companies — private equity firms real estate investment trusts pension funds sovereign wealth funds among others — are unwelcome players in the market for many first-time homebuyers who are already facing stiff competition for affordable homes and often can’t compete with big-pocketed companies that can make all-cash offers and forgo inspections or other due diligence.

“It’s a national trend that (institutional investors) are consuming more of the market” said Sara Coers associate director of the IU Center for Real Estate Studies. “…They’re acquiring big chunks of neighborhoods entire neighborhoods. There are actually developers who are developing for-rent neighborhoods.”

“They’re really squeezing out first-time buyers more than anything” Coers added. “…It’s basically turning everything that would have been an affordable homeownership situation into a rental situation.”

‘Unprecedented housing market’

Investors’ shift toward single-family rentals marks a departure from what real estate investment trusts and other investors have traditionally poured their money into — commercial real estate including apartments analysts said.

These companies and other investors started eyeing previously owned single-family homes during the depths of the housing bust in the mid-2000s gobbling up foreclosed properties at bargain prices often by the thousands The Associated Press reported. Many of the properties were converted to rentals.

At the same time banks stopped lending on new construction people stopped building houses and developing new neighborhoods and building permits dipped substantially across the country including in Indiana which helped lay the foundation for an “unprecedented supply-demand imbalance” Coers said.

Even though the housing market has more than bounced back since then a dearth of homes for sale and surging demand for rental housing has motivated Wall Street to stake its investment on renting single-family homes rather than selling them in a housing market thirsty for inventory according to wire reports.

The COVID-19 pandemic also has further fueled demand for single-family homes.

In Bartholomew County the median sale price of homes has risen dramatically during the pandemic reaching $273000 during a four-week period from June 27 to July 24 up from $252000 during roughly the same period last year and $190000 in 2019 according to data from real estate company Redfin.

The institutional investors for their part are betting that would-be homebuyers frustrated by the priciest housing market in decades will settle for renting their slice of the American Dream.

Many people who are currently renting single-family homes in Indiana are paying upwards of $2200 to $2400 per month even though they could have had a monthly mortgage payment of around $600 to $700 for the same home a year ago Coers said. Though people are paying “substantially more” to live in those homes people “are just making it work because they don’t have any other options” she said.

In Bartholomew County some single-family homes are renting for similar prices according to listings on Tricon’s website.

For example a 2361-square-foot three-bedroom home in Shadow Creek Farms owned by a Tricon-linked company was renting at $2199 per month as of Friday. The house was bought by a local resident for $219945 in October 2019 and was sold to Tricon’s joint venture this past June for $305000 — $85000 more than the home’s assessed value.

In addition a 1228-square-foot three-bedroom home on the northside of Columbus purchased by a Tricon-linked company was renting at $1499 per month according to Tricon’s website. That same home was purchased by a family for $179000 in April 2021 only to be sold a year later to the joint venture for $240000 local real estate records show.

But despite the price tag to rent these homes Tricon as well as competitors American Homes 4 Rent and Invitation Homes Inc. have reported record occupancy rates since the pandemic hit.

On Wednesday Tricon reported a record 98.3% same-home occupancy rate during the April-June quarter this year according to regulatory filings. The company sees a “significant runway for growth” in the single-home rental market hoping to expand its portfolio to 50000 by the end of 2024 according to the company’s most recent annual report.

“They’re crowding out the people’s ability to buy a home so those people then become renters and they’re often forced into housing that is an increasingly larger portion of what they earn in a given year. It’s pushing people’s housing costs much higher” Coers said. “But they are finding (tenants) because people need a place to live and if they can’t compete in the housing market because there’s just simply not enough supply they become renters and they’re still going to want that same home … but they just have to do it at a substantially higher price point as renters.”

“Even with interest rates rising homeowners would get a substantially better deal if they could buy those houses at what used to be typical market prices and get market financing” Coers said.

Overall concerns

The influx in big investors buying up single-family homes also has raised a number of concerns among housing advocates who say the trend is contributing to rising costs. They argue that the companies are constraining the supply of homes for sale when they buy them and convert them into rentals resulting in increased competition as the same number of buyers vie for the remaining homes on the market.

The Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana and advocacy group Prosperity Indiana say they have seen similar trends in other other communities in Indiana.

“I’ve heard the same story from Evansville to South Bend and now Columbus” said Andrew Bradley policy director of Prosperity Indiana adding that the number of purchases in Bartholomew County has the potential to be “disruptive to neighborhoods and the whole community.”

Amy Nelson executive director of the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana said she has seen a similar trend in Marion County particularly in some Black neighborhoods. Nelson said she believes institutional investors are “playing a role” in rising housing costs though there are a number of other factors at work.

“We were seeing investors coming in purchasing those affordable homes and flipping them over into expensive rentals” Nelson said. “So then people who may normally have been able to purchase those homes and become homeowners lost the ability to do that and had to stay in rentals and very well maybe having to rent those very homes at much higher prices than they could have bought them for.”

Other concerns include that an increase in real estate transactions in a neighborhood could potentially drive up property taxes in the area potentially pricing out some long-term residents Coers said. In addition investors may not have the same level of motivation to care for the home as a homeowner would.

“We see homes depreciate faster experience more physical issues such as maybe they don’t paint the exterior as frequently as a homeowner would have and if (the home) is wood it ages” Coers said. “We see more houses sort of become rundown which can have a negative impact on a neighborhood.”

Tricon did not respond to a request for comment on its operations in Bartholomew County. However the company’s president and CEO Gary Berman has said the rise in housing costs can’t just be pinned on institutional investors telling CBS’s 60 Minutes earlier this year that “corporate landlords represent 2% of all single-family rental housing. So there’s a lot more going on than just corporate landlords bidding up homes. It’s a very competitive and difficult environment.”

However solutions for the current market dynamic are hard to come by Coers said. One one hand “we don’t necessarily want to tell people ‘you can’t sell to somebody and maximize your dollar’” but selling lots of homes investors means fewer and fewer people can be homeowners Coers said.

“When you have more competition for less supply really we have no choice but to build more units to fix that situation but no one can feasibly with today’s cost build a home that matches (the under $300000) price point. So we’re relying on existing housing stock which is aging. I don’t think it’s sustainable but I also don’t see what the solution is.”

“Unless someone can figure out how to build a cheaper home that still serves the market and reaches market utility but can be under that $300000 price point if they can flood the market with those homes maybe we have a chance” Coers said. “But unfortunately they’re flooding them directly into investors’ hands.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Europe's geography tells us why,"War reveals many things mostly tragic. Among them is how geography continues to have the power to cause conflicts and to influence both how they are fought and their terrible consequences. The Ukraine–Russia conflict now takes its place in a grim pantheon of examples.

Between Russia and the rest of Europe are the Carpathian Mountains. Europe’s third-longest mountain range rises in southern Poland and swings southwards in an arc before petering out in Romania. After that the flat land runs down to the Black Sea. Throughout history if a large army wanted to approach Russia from the west the Carpathians stood in the way forcing it to skirt south or north around the range more usually north. This northern flat land is called Poland – it is the narrowest point of the North European Plain which stretches all the way back to France. Once an invading army heads east through Poland the plain widens again all along the Russian border.



Russia has been invaded several times from this direction most famously by Napoleon’s army in 1812 and Hitler’s in 1941. Therefore Russia has repeatedly tried to plug the gap – to occupy Poland most recently during the Cold War. Failing that the fallback position is to occupy or control the land immediately in front of that as a buffer zone – Belarus and Ukraine.



Russia also always seeks access to a warm-water port. To the north its navy is hemmed in by the ice pack for part of the year and forced to navigate in a constricted space when sailing out of the Baltic Sea and through the Skagerrak Strait to reach the North Sea.

Putin has been able to use this history and geographic weakness to garner support at home playing on his country’s collective memory and fears of the outside world.

In 2014 Russia occupied a sliver of Ukraine as a thin buffer zone and annexed Crimea to ensure it would have the warm-water port of Sevastopol in perpetuity as opposed to on loan. In 2022 it felt strong enough to try to take the rest.

The war brought Russian forces into Belarus and towards the Polish border. It also positioned them next to the Suwalki Gap – a short border of just 40 miles between Poland and Lithuania. At one end lies the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad home to 15000 Russian troops; on the other lies Belarus. If they were able to close the gap even with Finland and Sweden as Nato members Lithuania Latvia and Estonia would effectively be cut off as it is the only land route through which Nato can reinforce the three lightly armed Baltic states.

Russia’s presence in Belarus also means direct access to Poland across a wide front. Its forces in the region usually sit just inside Russia at the Smolensk Gate a 50-mile-wide territory between the Dzwina and Dnieper river systems. Military forces moving into or out of Russia are often channelled through it. Now the Russian army that normally guards the gate can move forward through Belarus which makes Poland and other countries nervous.



But despite these positions of strength the Kremlin is discovering that the law of unintended consequences is rarely more applicable than during war. Putin had expected Nato and the European Union to split between hawks and doves. Instead Nato has rediscovered its raison d’être and the EU has mostly come together.

The ramifications have been dramatic. Germany has cast off the post-war guilt of the past 75 years and toughened up cancelling Nord Stream 2 the massive gas pipeline project between Germany and Russia and committing to spending more on defence. Hungary has also been forced into making a choice: between Moscow or Brussels.

Hungary is close to Russia so has a strong pull magnified by the attraction for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban of a fellow ‘strongman’ nationalist. But geography and history are also at play. After the First World War the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dismembered with whole regions transferred to other countries. Among them was Transcarpathia which had been under Hungarian control for a thousand years. It ended up in what is now Ukraine on the border with Hungary. About 150000 ethnic Hungarians live in what is called Zakarpattia Oblast and there have long been tensions over their right to use their native language.

Budapest’s preferred option is to regain what it considers unjustly ‘lost lands’ but not to the extent that it lays legal claim to Transcarpathia. Nevertheless the combination of history and dependency on Russian energy has dictated Hungary’s policy response to the war next door.

About 65 per cent of Hungary’s oil and 75 per cent of its gas imports come from Russia and it has refused to join the sanctioning of Russia’s energy sector: just this week it agreed to pay an outstanding bill owed by Russia’s oil pipeline operator to the Ukrainian authorities. Hungary has also been unwilling to provide military aid to Ukraine and will not allow Nato weapons to transit through its territory en route to Ukraine – ostensibly to protect Transcarpathia and the Hungarians living there.

Long-threatened administrative procedures to cut EU funding to Hungary due to its standards on the rule of law were finally launched after Budapest failed to join the rest of the EU in condemning Putin’s war of choice. In the long term the Hungarian political class will have to choose between who they think is the better long-term partner for their country.

On flow the consequences. A new Iron Curtain is being drawn across Europe stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Turkey was drifting out of Nato but now seeing a Russia bent on dominating the Black Sea basin it knows its best bet to resist this is to remain in the alliance.

The theoretical line of this new division in Europe can be drawn further – along the borders of Iran and the Central Asian republics and all the way down to the China Sea. On one side are the industrialised democracies most of which have the USA as their ultimate security guarantor; on the other are authoritarian states mostly dominated by China. India is fence-sitting for now – slow to condemn Russia’s war of aggression because it wants to keep Moscow onside – but will find that harder if a major crisis between the democratic nations and China erupts.

The knock-on effects of Putin’s violence have been felt all over the world and not just in terms of geopolitical relationships. Russia and Ukraine are major producers of wheat; 26 countries rely on them for more than half of their annual imports. The war has resulted in shortages and price rises in the very countries that can least afford them. The Grim Reaper invades Ukraine and children in Egypt and Yemen go hungry. Why? The power of geography.

Hunt Transport,"The Log Book is a weekly rundown of human-interest stories related to the transportation industry. This week: The University of Arkansas’ undergraduate integrated supply chain management program renamed in honor of J.B. Hunt; CFI wraps another truck for its “She Drives CFI” initiative; and Bendix helps build a new high school athletic facility in the new headquarters’ community.

The University of Arkansas announced Thursday it has renamed its Sam M. Walton College of Business undergraduate integrated supply chain management program to the J.B. Hunt Transport Department of Supply Chain Management as the college and the Lowell Arkansas-based transportation and logistics company look to leverage the partnership to develop leaders for tomorrow’s future supply chain needs.

As part of the announcement J.B. Hunt also said it would be committing an additional $1.5 million toward the development of the renamed supply chain undergraduate program currently ranked as the No. 1 in the country by research firm Gartner.

“Walton College aims to be the leader in supply chain management education research and career readiness” said Matt Waller dean of the Walton College and holder of its leadership chair in business. “A gift of this magnitude from one of the global leaders in logistics can expand our reach to talented students expert faculty and industry thought leaders. Together we can advance the industry’s positive growth and practice.”

Over the last two years J.B. Hunt has donated $5 million to the Walton College of Business to help the Fayetteville Arkansas-based school become the top destination for future supply chain professionals. Since 2017 the company has gifted more than $7 million to the university to help with transportation and logistics initiatives.

After that initial gift in 2017 the partners created the J.B. Hunt Innovation Center of Excellence bringing students and researchers together to develop technology solutions for different supply chains. In 2020 J.B. Hunt made a $2.25 million donation and created a $1 million endowed scholarship to support diversity inclusion and equity initiatives within Walton College.

“J.B. Hunt and the University of Arkansas are shaping the future of the supply chain not just in northwest Arkansas but across the country” said Shelley Simpson president of J.B. Hunt. “Together we are preparing future leaders who will grow with the industry to meet evolving supply chain challenges. This will help us achieve our mission of creating the most efficient transportation network in North America — and ultimately the world.”

CFI gifts female driver with custom-wrapped truck

Truckload carrier Contract Freighters Inc. (CFI) on Wednesday unveiled a new company truck with a large wrap recognizing its “She Drives CFI” program which promotes better career opportunities for female professional drivers.





This is the fourth wrapped truck CFI has created for the program with each having been awarded to company female driver ambassadors that use them to participate in local events school programs community engagement opportunities truck shows and Special Olympics convoys.

At the unveiling event the truck was assigned to Penny Thomas who has been driving for CFI for 15 years with over 1.6 million safe-driving miles behind her.

CFI currently employs over 4000 women drivers which represents about 14% of its total driving workforce. The company hopes its “She Drives CFI” wrapped trucks will inspire more women to jump in a big rig and hit the road.

“These trucks recognize the professional excellence and skills of their drivers and serve to encourage more women to choose trucking as a career” said Greg Orr president of CFI.

Avon Ohio-based Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems announced Thursday it has handed the Avon Athletic Boosters’ Project SOAR a $25000 construction gift to help modernize the high school’s athletics building into a 4400-square-foot structure outside of its stadium to house locker rooms coaches’ office medical training room and open community room.

With this donation the new coaches’ office will be named after the vehicle systems company as well.

“The new athletic facility [plan] is impressive and we are very proud to have joined with other Avon-area businesses families and individuals in supporting Project SOAR and its mission to further the school’s athletic program” said Maria Gutierrez Bendix director of corporate responsibility and sustainability. “With Bendix’s recent move to Avon this was a project that tied both to our new community and to the local school system establishing a connection that we hope will flourish and grow in the coming years. Sports are always a great way to reach youth and a perfect avenue to teach students about teamwork discipline leadership and many other skills that we value as a business so this project was a strong fit.”

Project SOAR is a subset of the Avon Athletic Boosters which came together in 2019 to find a way to support the school’s athletics program. First the group was looking to build a two-story practice building but settled on the one-story facility when labor challenges and construction costs began to pile up.





After Bendix moved its North American headquarters to Avon Ohio in 2021 SOAR became aware of the company’s commitment to community support and reached out directly to help wrap up the new athletics facility project.

“The best kind of projects are the ones where the whole community comes together to get something done and I think this is a great example” said Matt Canning Project SOAR co-chair. “We were able to pull together the community businesses the school district private donors and sweat equity and labor from players and parents. That’s the combination that made this happen.”

For Bendix it represented a great introduction to the Avon community and what it hopes to accomplish in the future.

“We maintain a continuing relationship with the district” Gutierrez said. “We hope to support other projects including academic programs that relate to STEM or sustainability.”

JKHY,Jack Henry & Associates,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbmFseXN0LWVzdGltYXRlcy1oZXJlcy1icm9rZXJzLXRoaW5rLTExNDUyNzY2MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analyst Estimates: Here's What Brokers Think Of Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Check out our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady in line with previous estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$181 with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.

Following on from that line of thought we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St we have a full range of analyst estimates for Jack Henry & Associates going out to 2026 and you can see them free on our platform here..

The U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command announced Friday that Darkstar a group of expert divers from the UK found wreckage belonging to the USS Jacob Jones off the southwestern tip of England.

The ship was tasked with patrolling and escorting convoys around the United Kingdom from May 1917 until its sinking on December 6.

The destroyer was 60 miles off the coast of England near the English Channel when a torpedo struck three feet below the water line.

Historians said in the eight minutes sailors had until the ship sank less than half the crew found refuge aboard emergency rafts.

It is believed only 46 of the 110 crew members survived the attack.

The NHHC says after the sinking a German U-boat commander took two prisoners of war from the chilly waters and radioed a nearby American base about the need for rescue ships.

Because of how quickly the over 1000-ton destroyer sank its final resting place was a mystery for over a century.

UK divers estimate the ship is at a depth of 400 feet and said they did not remove any items from the wreckage site during the recent excursion.

Historians consider the destroyer a workhorse and responsible for rescuing hundreds of survivors from torpedoed ships before it suffered a similar fate.

By the end of the war in November 1918 it is believed Germany was responsible for sinking more than 5000 merchant ships and around 100 warships.

Historians say despite the efforts German forces could not overcome the Allies’ sea capabilities and sheer numbers.

Jacob Borbin 14 was shot in the chest and killed early Thursday morning.

Investigators initially believed a gun may have accidentally gone off while Jacob and friends were hanging out inside the lobby of an apartment building on East 194th Street in the Fordham Manor neighborhood.

They were right.

Johnson’s first year in office has been a roller-coaster ride filled with the ups of having delivered on a checklist of progressive promises — and the downs of managing contentious relationships with Gov. J.B. Pritzker the Illinois General Assembly the business community and police.

There’s even mounting tension with a City Council emboldened by Johnson’s failure to deliver on his signature promise to secure a new revenue source to combat homelessness.

In an interview with the Sun-Times and WBEZ Johnson reflected on his “remarkable journey” to the mayor’s office and the very “different trajectory” he followed to get there.

He said he’s proud of fulfilling so many items on his progressive to-do list and described a year of accomplishments tempered by impatience.

“There are frustrating moments that I do have where you … just wish you could address everything at the same time” Johnson said. “That’s just unfortunately not where we are — just because the damage has been so severe and it has been so widespread” especially in “historically marginalized” communities.

Johnson acknowledged he hasn’t made everybody happy but that comes with the turf.

“If the role of the mayor is to satisfy everyone then we would not have had 56 prior to me” he said.

Migrant crisis missteps

From the beginning Johnson has been dogged by the migrant crisis he inherited. One of his first Council meetings included a cathartic vote on $51 million in surplus funding for the crisis — after a contentious “us-versus-them” debate that reduced one alderperson to tears.

Johnson’s handling of the crisis telegraphed the freshman mayor’s growing pains. He unveiled plans for a winterized camp at a contaminated Southwest Side industrial site only to have Pritzker reject the idea amid environmental concerns.

The local alderperson a progressive ally felt blindsided by the mayor’s plan and was subsequently physically accosted by furious constituents.

The abandoned plan ended up costing Chicago taxpayers nearly $1 million.

But Johnson succeeded in emptying Chicago police station lobbies filled with migrants and returning Chicago Park District field houses to their intended use. He did that by opening brick-and-mortar shelters at a furious pace. At its peak 27 shelters held more than 14600 migrants.

“When I stepped into office … you had contracts that were bloated and it was costing the taxpayers an enormous amount of dollars. ... We’ve transformed all of that. … We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million” Johnson said.

But the biggest shelter in Pilsen was crowded and unsanitary. A 5-year-old boy there died of sepsis and it later was the epicenter of a measles outbreak.

Alderpersons are now pushing back on the mayor’s 60-day eviction policy — which was delayed three times and already has forced more than 650 people from shelters.

Johnson also stumbled by initially reneging on a deal with Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle one of his political patrons to provide $70 million in additional city funding to support migrants through 2024.

His first budget included just $150 million in funding he knew would last only until April 1. He deliberately lowballed the figure to put pressure on the federal government but the tactic failed. At one point he used $95 million in federal stimulus money to slap an end-of-year Band-Aid on the migrant crisis. But that alienated some alderpersons who control spending and were not consulted.

Johnson’s hand-picked chair of the Council’s Immigrant and Refugee Rights Committee has frequently complained about being shut out of conversations about the migrant crisis including about the mayor’s eviction policy. Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) eventually strong-armed the administration into publishing regular data on evictions.

“There needs to be some work done as it relates to transparency and accountability as well as cooperation and engagement and dialogue with the alders” Vasquez said. “It’s about figuring out how to engage with everybody.”

Alderpersons’ grievances with Johnson were on full display at the last Council meeting where they called for the mayor to be more forthright about migrant funding and equal spending on long disinvested communities.

Even after the griping the Council ultimately passed two of Johnson’s top spending priorities including $70 million from city reserves for migrant spending to honor the deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle.

“I know how to count and both those votes received more than 30 votes from City Council” said Workforce Development Chair Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd). “That sounds like a win to me.”

After closing nearly a dozen shelters amid declining numbers Johnson said he’s “preparing” for a possible influx of migrants in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August. But there are “limitations to what we can do” without more federal help he said.

Progress on progressive wish list

Johnson’s legislative successes have been impressive.

In the first year alone he has phased out the subminimum wage for tipped workers; pushed through the most generous paid leave policy in the country; reinstated the city’s Department of Environment; and laid the groundwork to reopen two shuttered mental health clinics.

The mayor has also begun to ease the pressure on Chicago police officers by expanding a plan to send mental health providers instead of police to nonviolent mental health emergencies.

Johnson kept his promise to put a binding referendum on the ballot that would have authorized the Council to increase the real estate transfer tax to create a dedicated funding source for homelessness prevention. But Chicago voters rejected it a major defeat widely viewed as a referendum on the mayor’s first year in office.

Mayoral allies in the Council’s Progressive Caucus heard the message loud and clear and vowed to work harder to win voters’ trust and simplify a complicated referendum that many voters didn’t understand.

“Ignoring what those critiques are and thinking that we’re just morally right isn’t going to lead to future wins” Vasquez said.

At the time Johnson responded to the defeat with bravado warning anyone who might assume one defeat would make him put the brakes on his progressive agenda to “buckle up.”

More recently the mayor won Council approval for a $1.25 billion bond issue devised by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot to fund housing and economic development programs. The same goes for Lightfoot’s plan which Johnson expanded to transform nearly vacant buildings along La Salle Street into more affordable residential units.

Canceling the city’s contract with the gunshot detection technology company known as ShotSpotter also delivered on a progressive promise. Johnson and his base have long viewed ShotSpotter as a surveillance tool that leads to overpolicing in Black and Brown communities.

But Johnson’s decision was somewhat overshadowed by his delivery. He announced it just days before the contract was to expire then scrambled to negotiate an extension through the historically violent summer months and the Democratic National Convention.

ShotSpotter and the broken migrant funding promise with Pritzker and Preckwinkle were the subject of a disastrous Feb. 15 news conference showcasing a communication problem dominating Johnson’s first year in office.

He evaded some questions answered in platitudes and declined to say if he’d walked away from a migrant funding deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle or nailed down the ShotSpotter extension before announcing a phase-out.

That defining moment in his relationship with the media seems to have led to a course correction. Johnson finally named a permanent communications director in Ronnie Reese who had essentially filled the role since Johnson took office. Johnson also hired a chief strategy officer Joe Calvello who learned the art of being “radically open and honest” while guiding U.S. Sen. John Fetterman D-Pa. through a difficult campaign dominated by health issues.

The changes appear to have made an impact already with Johnson taking media questions more often and answering those questions a bit more directly.

Mixed bag for business

Johnson’s aggressive agenda such as costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage put him at odds with the business community.

But labor leaders said Johnson also had displayed a willingness to compromise on both issues even as business groups kept “moving the goalposts.”

“They were looking not to compromise. They’re just looking to stop the policy. And that’s not realistic” said Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter noting similar policies have been adopted by other major cities.

Johnson also appeared to extend an olive branch with recent rollouts of pro-development policies. And his choice of seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright as commissioner of Planning and Development also was applauded by the business community.

Besides the La Salle Street plan the mayor proposed recommendations to cut bureaucratic red tape on business development and revived the long-stalled O’Hare expansion project by hammering out a cost-cutting deal with the major airlines.

Johnson also held the line on city property taxes — though he allowed Chicago Public Schools to boost property taxes to the limit two years in a row.

“It’s been a little bit up and down. Some positives. Some negatives” Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce President Jack Lavin said of Johnson’s first year adding that there’s “a lot of work to be done to improve communication” and trust between the mayor and the business community.

“He has a tax agenda. We have ideas on how we can grow the economy. And we’re going to have to come together because federal money is drying up. There’s lots of fiscal cliffs and fiscal challenges coming up” Lavin said. “He’s the mayor. We’ve all got to work together. If the mayor is not successful Chicago’s not going to be successful.”

With two of four city employee pension funds hovering perilously close to insolvency Johnson has displayed some financial acumen by continuing a Lightfoot policy of making additional payments. He also appointed a working group to study the $35 billion crisis — which has yet to produce any ideas on solving it.

Goodwill from police is short-lived

Johnson’s choice of Larry Snelling as police superintendent played to rave reviews. A commanding and reassuring presence he’s already won the support of the demoralized rank and file.

The mayor also extended the police contract and sweetened police raises. But the feel-good period was somewhat short-lived.

He infuriated officers by twice asking Council members to reject an arbitrator’s ruling allowing officers accused of the most serious wrongdoing to bypass the Police Board taking their cases to arbitration.

“For a Democratic mayor to be so anti-union it’s pretty breathtaking” said Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara.

As expected a judge sided with the union — but agreed to make the arbitration process more public and that meant the back-to-back Council votes were more than “symbolic” Johnson said.

Johnson did keep a campaign promise to hire 200 new detectives and free officers for street duty by hiring civilians to perform office jobs. And to the consternation of some progressive allies he increased the police budget to nearly $1.99 billion.

Still Snelling told a town hall in Jefferson Park recently that Chicago remains down about 2000 officers citywide and struggles with low recruitment.

Like Lightfoot Johnson has devised a plan to get at the root causes of crime. His hyperlocal version focuses on 10 multiblock areas in four neighborhoods: Englewood Austin Little Village and West Garfield Park.

Those neighborhoods — plagued by school closings and high dropout rates while lacking public amenities like parks and libraries — will receive an array of services including priority in another round of the city’s guaranteed minimum income program.

Johnson has also put a heavy focus on creating more summer jobs and neighborhood recreational opportunities for young people to give them alternatives to a trend of mass downtown gatherings that have turned violent.

Shootings and homicides are down slightly but robberies remain stubbornly high. In neighborhoods citywide Chicagoans continue to feel unsafe waking up to reports of another wave of strong-armed robberies store break-ins and carjackings.

Reducing violent crime remains such a priority alderpersons who believe ShotSpotter is an effective prevention tool have vowed to perhaps symbolically defy the mayor and tie his hands on ending the contract.

Johnson plays Council tie-breaker

Twice in the first year Johnson was forced to cast tie-breaking Council votes: To save his now-ousted Zoning chair and floor leader Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) from censure; and to approve a nonbinding resolution for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

The cease-fire resolution strained Johnson’s relationship with many Jewish leaders and the only Jewish alderperson Debra Silverstein (50th). Some Jewish elected officials and civic leaders — including the Anti-Defamation League Midwest state Sen. Sara Feigenholtz and state Rep. Bob Morgan — later declined the mayor’s invitation to a recent meeting meant to ease the tension.

But not supporting the resolution would have diminished his relationships with progressives and Arab Americans. He noted that calling for a cease-fire is in line with his values and that several progressive pro-Palestinian Jewish groups did attend the meeting.

“As far as me calling for peace I hardly consider that controversial. ... The entire country and people around the world are calling for that. That’s something that we value as residents of the city of Chicago but it’s also part of our responsibility as global residents that calling for peace and an end to war is a part of our very profound tradition” he said.

The Chicago area’s large Palestinian community demanded for months that Johnson and his Council majority take a stand voicing their feelings at numerous raucous Council meetings.

The division caused by the war has spread to college campuses in Chicago and nationwide foreshadowing the civil disobedience that might occur when Democrats gather here in August to formally nominate President Joe Biden for reelection.

If Johnson is too timid he risks allowing demonstrators to run roughshod over Chicago. If he allows Chicago police to be too heavy-handed he runs the risk of civil rights violations and the inevitable comparison to the disaster of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Johnson’s first chief of staff Rich Guidice a seasoned City Hall lifer was widely expected to serve through the convention bringing the expertise garnered from guiding Chicago through decades of major events. But Guidice abruptly resigned last month.

The tie-breaking vote that spared Ramirez-Rosa from censure followed his resignation from leadership after apologizing for bullying and threatening colleagues to block a symbolic referendum on whether Chicago should remain a sanctuary city.

Johnson hasn’t named a replacement for Ramirez-Rosa — either as Zoning chair or floor leader. Some Council members are demanding a replacement from the Latino Caucus but Johnson has yet to find someone he trusts who can also win alderpersons’ support.

Meanwhile some of Johnson’s progressive supporters said they believe rushing to force Ramirez-Rosa’s resignation went too far and that an apology should have sufficed.

Backing the Bears puzzles progressives

Progressives were also left scratching their heads when Johnson embraced the Bears’ plan for a sprawling domed stadium south of Soldier Field — a project requiring billions of state and federal dollars that haven’t been approved or identified.

When the Bears unveiled their stadium plan Johnson acted more like a cheerleader than a guardian of taxpayers and protector of precious lakefront parkland.

Asked if the plan violated the city ordinance prohibiting new construction along the lakefront Johnson referred to the Bears’ promise of increased green space on the Museum Campus. But he failed to mention that those additional 14 acres are possible only if the state and federal governments cover all $1.5 billion in infrastructure costs.

Putting the Bears stadium near the top of his legislative wish list contradicts Johnson’s campaign stance. Now though Johnson calls Soldier Field a “100-year-old building” — even though it was rebuilt in 2003. Paying off what’s owed on that renovation will drain city coffers unless the debt is refinanced in the new stadium funding package.

“If someone else has another solution that addresses this problem then they should put that on the table” Johnson said.

Every mayor loves a giant public works project. They generate jobs contracts and political donations and are a feel-good diversion from Chicago’s intransigent problems. Then-Mayor Richard M. Daley had his failed 2016 Olympic bid. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel had Elon Musk’s high-speed tunnel train to O’Hare Airport.

Johnson’s stadium plan similarly appears to be going nowhere. Springfield has far higher priorities.

“The position he’s taking there … seems to run at odds with his key base of support from progressives. I understand the temptation and desire to put forward a signature project — a legacy project if you will … But it just seems like an unforced error in the way he rolled it out” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.

“Unforced errors is sort of a common theme that we are seeing in many respects. … Communication with the public and the press remains lacking” he said.

At the Bears’ announcement Johnson was “speaking in platitudes from scripted remarks” and couldn’t “really engage with the questions being asked” Greising said which undermined “his ability to earn support from people most affected by the decisions he is making.”

Pritzker did not address the Bears stadium controversy or other points of tension with Johnson saying instead: “The first year of any administration is often the most challenging and I commend Mayor Johnson and his team for reaching this milestone.”

Springfield stumbles

A stadium defeat would not be Johnson’s first in Springfield.

Last month the Illinois House voted 92-8 to approve a bill curbing the power of Johnson’s revamped hand-picked school board. A Senate committee did the same last week during Johnson’s first Springfield lobbying trip as mayor. The bill would prevent Chicago Public Schools from making any admissions or funding changes to selective-enrollment programs and from closing any schools until a fully elected school board takes control in early 2027.

There was no mistaking the message to Johnson’s board which wants to prioritize investing in neighborhood schools over choice schools like selective-enrollments. The original bill was amended to extend an existing moratorium on closing all schools and not just selective schools after lobbying by the CTU.

Asked what message he took from the vote to tie his hands on an important education issue Johnson noted it still needs final approval.

“It’s not a law so nothing has happened” he said.

An emotional CTU President Stacy Davis Gates — perhaps reflecting on setbacks like these — told supporters last fall she was “ashamed of myself” for having helped put Johnson — “my brother” she called him — in “an impossible place.”

Asked recently what made her ashamed Davis Gates talked about the resistance Johnson had faced during his first year.

“Transformation is happening right now in Chicago and every corner of the city because of his leadership. And that level of transformation either makes you a hero or it makes you a villain” Davis Gates said. “It’s not lukewarm. It’s either hot or cold and that is a very precarious position to live in.”

Remaking Chicago Public Schools

As a candidate Johnson promised to make progressive changes to CPS and he has.

His revamped board is led by former science teacher Jianan Shi who also led the parent advocacy group Raise Your Hand for Illinois Public Education. Johnson’s board is filled with others with community-organizing experience.

That board has delivered on a promise to shift away from student-based budgeting that progressives argue exacerbates challenges at schools serving low-income communities and toward a need-based funding model.

But he’s already disappointed some parents by sticking with a plan for a phased-in elected school board instead of delivering that pivotal reform in one fell swoop.

Johnson will also have to find a way to deliver for the schools parents and his former colleagues at the teachers union without breaking the bank in the CTU contract he is now negotiating. Teachers started out by demanding a 9% raise or to match inflation whichever is higher.

“I know what it takes — from a teacher’s perspective as well as a parent’s perspective and a student’s perspective — to have a more transformational educational experience” Johnson said. “And that’s what our focus has to be: funding our schools and actually transforming them so that they are fully fully expressed in an equitable way.”

CPS faces a $391 million deficit for the upcoming school year not including raises being negotiated for teachers and a 4% raise already promised to support staff. The CTA and other mass transit agencies are facing their own funding cliffs.

That’s another point of contention between Johnson and Pritzker.

The governor and others are demanding a leadership change at CTA before providing any new money. Others want to merge all four Chicago-area mass transit agencies into a single super-agency to reduce costs improve operations and create a uniform fare system.

Johnson harshly critical of CTA performance during the campaign has stuck with embattled CTA President Dorval Carter Jr. no favorite of Chicago alderpersons.

When Pritzker dared demand a leadership change the mayor replied that he alone gets to choose the CTA president adding “If people want to be mayor they should run for it.”

Room to grow into job

Johnson likes to say he intends to serve for 23 years — long enough to become Chicago’s longest-serving mayor bypassing Richard M. Daley.

But that will require him to grow and mature in the job and survive many upcoming tests. While his first budget made no real political waves the second will demand making cuts raising property taxes or finding new sources of revenue while still chipping away at his commitment to invest in people.

Despite Johnson’s gestures to the business community Greising said many business leaders he talks to “feel like they still don’t know him still don’t understand what he’s trying to do and what they can do for him — and still don’t feel heard by him.

“Every successful mayor has found a way to have the business community with him. And this mayor so far doesn’t seem to work very hard on that.

“We shouldn’t be all that surprised when we elect someone with his background that there’s a very steep learning curve” he said. “But … he really needs to invest his effort into growing in those areas where he is falling short. If he doesn’t do that with urgency then it will be too late.”

Davis Gates acknowledged the growing pains.

“For so long in this city people who have needed [the most] have been told ‘no’” she said. Now after years of “demanding a thing happens fighting for a thing to happen protesting rallying door-knocking” progressives are in charge she said.

“To make things happen those are different muscles ... The muscles that we have to develop now — not just as a movement not just as a mayor but as an entire city — is No. 1 we’ve got to get more inclusive. We’ve got to figure out how to work past our differences” she said.

It will take some time for this “new formation that we have in Chicago” to settle in Johnson said.

“The way these systems have been built particularly government they have been built in a very complex way to favor the few” he said.

“There has been sort of an unfettered access of a handful of powerful people having access to the fifth floor” the mayor said. “Maybe they’re not used to sharing. And that’s going to take some adjustment.”

Mayor's up-and-down first year in office Mayor’s up-and-down first year in office • The migrant crisis has dominated much of Johnson’s first year: The crisis exposed the growing pains of a new mayor and exacerbated historic tensions between Chicago’s Black and Hispanic communities. One key setback: Johnson’s determination to locate a migrant camp at a contaminated industrial site in Brighton Park. Gov. J.B. Pritzker canceled that project over those environmental concerns.



• It’s been a mixed bag on progressives’ wish list: Johnson was able to get the Chicago City Council to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and require city employers to give their employees at least 10 paid days off a year. But voters rejected his “Bring Chicago Home” referendum which would have increased the real estate transfer tax and used the money to fund programs to reduce homelessness.



• His relationship with the business community has been rocky: He enacted those costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage but also helped developers with an initiative to cut bureaucratic red tape and his decision to move forward on a plan to convert some LaSalle Street office buildings in the Loop for residential use. And he broke a stalemate with United and American airlines to reduce costs and move forward with a massive multi-billion-dollar expansion and renovation of O’Hare International Airport.



• Unease about Johnson’s inexperience was soothed by some of his early appointments: Rich Guidice a City Hall veteran recently retired from the Office of Emergency Management and Communications returned as Johnson’s chief of staff though he lasted less than a year. Seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright became commissioner of the city’s Planning and Development Department. And Johnson’s choice as police superintendent Larry Snelling had been with CPD for years and remains popular with the rank-and-file.



• Johnson spent some of his fragile political capital in casting tie-breaking votes in the Council: One was on a symbolic resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The mayor’s other tie-breaking vote was to save Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa from censure. The alderperson Johnson’s floor leader was accused of bullying some fellow members.



• Every mayor loves a big jobs-creating public works project: Richard M. Daley had his Olympic bid Rahm Emanuel had his high-speed tunnel to O’Hare that Elon Musk was going to build. Johnson’s appears to be the Bears’ bid for a new lakefront domed stadium but jumping on board so soon when the level of public funding is so high — and still in doubt “seems like an unforced error” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.



• Johnson’s experience as a teacher plays a role: Johnson a former organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union owes his election in part to the support of that union and entered office with teachers’ support. And while he has remade the CPS board — and the board has shifted schools to a need-based funding formula he also disappointed parents by backing away from shifting to an all-elected school board right away opting instead to phase in elected members.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Mayor Brandon Johnson's pick to serve on the board of the Regional Transportation Authority is coming under fire.

He's tapped a well-known West Side pastor for the job.

But some Chicago aldermen argue that he's not ready to get behind the wheel especially after some comments that's he's made about riding the CTA.

The Rev. Ira Acree is a longtime well-known pastor and community organizer on the West Side.

He hopes to take on an additional role as a board member for the Regional Transportation Authority the governing body that oversees CTA Metra and Pace. Acree was nominated by Mayor Johnson.

""With Rev. Acree being a member of this community we definitely support him because he knows the challenges that people and communities face. It doesn't have to be a transit expert"" 28th Ward Ald. Jason Ervin said.

As members of City Council's transportation committee learned Wednesday Acree is far from a transit expert. While he grew up using public transportation Acree told the committee as an adult he occasionally uses it downtown.

""As a man I don't have to use the CTA. I'm fortunate to have a car"" Acree said.

While transportation is facing a crisis Acree said he needs more information to make any judgments about CTA Chief Dorval Carter or an effort in Springfield to consolidate the RTA CTA and Pace.

""You actually have to have knowledge about what's happening to the whole RTA system and to not have any answers at all was a little bit offensive"" 32nd Ward Ald. Scott Waguespack said.

In addition Waguespack was disappointed Acree was unaware of an RTA $730 million shortfall.

""This is the first time hearing of a 730 shortfall; I wouldn't want to respond without doing research"" Acree said.

Before appearing before the committee Acree admitted he never spoke with the mayor about the administration's transportation vision.

""I think a mayor and administration need to be reaching out and the fact that they haven't says a lot about things"" 40th Ward Ald. Andre Vasquez said.

""We have hundreds of people in this city thousands regionally who could take on this job and have the knowledge on day one walking into it. And I think that's where the mayor's office failed"" Waguespack said.

Waguespack and Vasquez were the only two committee members to vote against Acree's appointment. Others say serving on the RTA board doesn't require expertise.

""You can purchase expertise but you can't purchase that people have known understanding of the community on the South and West sides"" Ervin said.

Acree said he is not making himself available for interviews until his appointment is confirmed by the full City Council.

With the exception of a few aldermen Acree's nomination is expected to pass.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXItdGVsZWdyYW0uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZm9ydC13b3J0aC9hcnRpY2xlMjg4MzU2NjEwLmh0bWzSAUlodHRwczovL2FtcC5zdGFyLXRlbGVncmFtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ZvcnQtd29ydGgvYXJ0aWNsZTI4ODM1NjYxMC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘I haven’t even buried my son’: Family of Anthony Johnson demands answers in jail death,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.star-telegram.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The NYPD had already made its first round of arrests at Columbia’s Gaza solidarity encampment and two days earlier faculty and students had been arrested trying to set up an encampment at NYU. No one knew what would happen at Harvard. The students involved in the protest had asked me to serve as a “police liaison” which involved speaking to the officers in charge and acting as a go-between if things got heated. That day dozens of students streamed out of the dormitories around Harvard Yard joined the hundreds gathered there for a protest and set up their tents. Since then I have served “shifts” as a police liaison for the encampment. Much of what I have written below is based on my observations.

Unlike the police at so many other American universities and in so many other American cities over the past two weeks the Harvard University Police did not move in to break the encampment up. The university administration had apparently anticipated the students’ actions: the gates of Harvard Yard had been closed for several days limiting access to university ID holders. As the protesters ran into the yard it quickly became obvious that Harvard police were willing to let them set up their tents as long as they did not attempt to occupy either of the two buildings on the yard that house the administration. Harvard would follow a different path than Columbia: rather than panic and apply overwhelming force it would test the students’ commitment using administrative sanction. But for the moment the mood in the Yard was joyous. In a matter of minutes the students managed to put up a dozen tents and inflate a giant watermelon-slice-shaped balloon; they were celebrating laughing and dancing.

The encampment now includes about fifty-six tents. Most of it sits between the headquarters of the Faculty of Arts of Sciences (University Hall) and the building that houses the president’s and provost’s offices (Massachusetts Hall). It is filled with precisely the diverse range of students that the university has long claimed it wants to bring together: Muslim Christian and Jewish; white brown and Black; gay and straight; cisgender trans and nonbinary; people whose origins lie all over the world as well as those who grew up in small towns in rural America. Students joke that it is the multicultural center that Harvard has never agreed to build.

On a lamppost facing University Hall they have posted a list of demands: that Harvard disclose investments that connect the university to the occupation of Palestinian land and the war in Gaza; that it divest from those holdings and reinvest the money in academic and direct support of Palestinian communities and culture; and that it drop all disciplinary charges filed against students for their nonviolent actions in the yard. So far the university has refused to negotiate. As the days pass the students have set up a small cluster of tents on the quadrangle (Tercentenary Theater) where commencement is scheduled to occur in two and a half weeks. At the front is a canopy-style tent with a table inside. Above it sits a hand-lettered sign emblazoned with the words DEAR ADMIN. COME TO THE TABLE and an arrow pointing downward to an open seat.

On Monday morning the university’s response arrived. It took the form of an email to the current university community and all Harvard alumni stating that students involved in “perpetuating” the encampment would be placed on “involuntary leave” a status usually reserved for those judged to be imminent dangers to themselves or the community. Involuntary leave is immediate—no disciplinary process precedes it—and stays in effect unless the university revokes it.

Still the encampment remains busy for most of the day. Groups of students sit on the steps of University Hall writing papers or studying for exams. Others gather and talk in small groups on the broad walkway between the grass and University Hall. Some pass a soccer ball back and forth in a circle. There are teach-ins about the Nakba the occupation and the war in Gaza. Anyone is welcome to attend. One afternoon there was a rally with drumming chanting and dancing on the walkways. At night some students retreat to tents; others pass through the encampment and along the surrounding sidewalks picking up trash. Many people here have hardly slept in days. A filmmaker colleague described the mood to me as sumud—an Arabic word that is generally translated as “steadfastness”—used in this instance to describe the feeling of joy amid great suffering. Not in spite of the suffering but because of it.

The encampment includes several large supply tents filled with what a colleague from the medical school referred to as “nearly a ton of simple carbohydrates.” The lawn where the encampment started is bisected by walkways and each section of grass is cordoned off by a flimsy rope fence. Students and administrators alike have tacitly used these ropes—originally intended to keep pedestrians from walking on the grass—to mark the distinction between the students who are in the camp and those who are there to support or observe them.

Around the edges student marshals in yellow vests warn anyone who walks among the tents that they are risking administrative sanction and arrest. For days when university officials come around to check ID cards which they do once or twice a day those in the camp would stay inside the line and those who are just visiting would stand outside. The officials would photograph their cards and enter them into a database the university is using to track students. More recently they have it seems been checking IDs in the yard at random photographing whomever refuses to comply. At least two professors visiting their students in the Yard have been stopped and photographed in this manner.

The encampment is full of posters placards and art. A sign at one end facing a now-locked gate reads WELCOME TO THE PEOPLE’S UNIVERSITY – FOR PALESTINE. Others say LIBERATED ZONE FREE PALESTINE and CEASEFIRE. On a scrolled-out piece of fabric about fifty feet long and a yard wide the students have recorded the names and ages of 5000 of the 34000 people who have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza since October. At the head of the encampment sits the bronze statue of John Harvard the university’s seventeenth-century benefactor and namesake atop a six-foot plinth a keffiyeh wrapped around his neck.

Over the last seven months some of these students have been defamed and slandered their names and faces posted on the pro-Israel website Canary Mission which circulates information about students and faculty critical of the Israeli government’s policies. Their inboxes have filled with hate mail. One told me that a truck bearing a huge photo of her face beneath the legend “Harvard’s Leading Antisemites” had visited her hometown. “There are only five thousand people there” she said. “Three policemen. We don’t even have a fire truck.”

For much of this time Harvard was the epicenter of the nationwide panic over “antisemitism on American college campuses.” A handful of vocal critics on campus and a number of prominent figures in the mainstream media have reframed the understandable discomfort that some Jewish and Israeli students feel when confronted with insistent public protests against the state of Israel—and some scattered and contemptible incidents of genuine antisemitism—into a misleading claim that they are in constant danger as their fellow students run wild calling for as Representative Elise Stefanik put it “the genocide of Jews.” In the face of the McCarthyite congressional investigation that effectively toppled Harvard’s president Claudine Gay in January and the well-documented revolt of megadonors who perceived its actions in the fall to be insufficiently supportive of Israel the university administration long stayed largely silent about events on campus. Their silence has allowed those misrepresentations to stand.

In addition to the threat of involuntary leave the university had already brought disciplinary cases against dozens of students. The charges are confidential but generally they focus on the encampment’s disruption of university business. By best count there are now close to sixty students both undergraduate and graduate facing discipline up to and including expulsion.

The encampment is of course intended to be disruptive. That is the purpose of civil disobedience: to call attention to the gap between the course our institutions are following and the path of justice; and to let those institutions discredit themselves with disproportionate reactions to comparatively mild challenges. As the days have gone on the tone of the campers’ protest has become more confrontational: running a Palestinian flag up the standard affixed to the front of University Hall; setting up the branch encampment in the quad where commencement will soon occur. The administration has responded with still more disciplinary charges and has in some cases declared the belongings that students have set down on the steps while they visit the encampment to be abandoned property gathered their blankets and possessions (including in one case a bag containing a student’s laptop) placed them in trash bags and piled them up to await collection.

“Free free Palestine!” a hundred students chanted one day last week arrayed in a circle around the beleaguered dean who had been sent to photograph their ID cards. I felt for him as I am sure many of the students did. But this is the way the administration has chosen to engage the students: it has met them in the realm of administrative sanction rather than recognizing the moral purpose and institutional seriousness of the issues they raise.

From time to time a middle-aged man walks through the camp wrapped in an Israeli flag. There are other visitors too. One day I saw a couple of younger more intense provocateurs show up dressed in coats and ties with American and Israeli flags. They walked through the encampment filming people’s faces. Lately I have heard (though I have not witnessed it myself) that counterprotestors come some days and sit in the middle of the encampment for a time. Sometimes they put up their own posters around the John Harvard statue and sing; occasionally they too have photographed the faces of the protesters even when the latter were kneeling in prayer.

Curious professors and other university affiliates have also passed through. Some have stood among the students and threatened to join the protest if the university calls in the police to break up the encampment as has happened elsewhere. Though the encampment is easy to avoid some seem to want to see it without themselves being seen. They hurry by as if caught in a rainstorm eyes fixed in front shoulders tensed. Some are dismayed by it. Stephen E. Sachs Antonin Scalia Professor of Law at Harvard Law School visited the camp and described it on Twitter as “a bunch of people quietly hanging out and listening to a teach-in lecture amid handmade signs glorifying violence and urging the destruction of Israel.” The self-proclaimed free-speech advocate Steven Pinker visited the camp one afternoon and later told the Harvard Crimson that it should be torn down because he considered it designed “to make campus life as unpleasant as possible.”

I was especially interested in the response of an Israeli American computer science professor named Boaz Barak who last fall co-organized a letter that harshly criticized the students in the undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee. This letter as I have written elsewhere seemed to me both to misconstrue a statement that the students had made in the aftermath of October 7 and to exacerbate the climate of doxing and personal vilification that followed. And so I was surprised when on Twitter he wrote of his visit to the encampment: “Sorry to disappoint but none of them have horns and no one I talked to supports Hamas. I saw students who care very deeply about what is happening and mostly want the war to stop and the hostages to return.”

Though he wrote in a Crimson op-ed the same day that he believed the encampment was a distraction from the hard work of actually achieving those goals his statement nonetheless struck me as remarkable. In addition to the moral panic about antisemitism there has been a great deal of institutional alarm at Harvard about the inability of the students to sustain the sort of conversation that Barak described. The Council on Academic Freedom a faculty organization formed in March 2023 to promote “the free and civil exchange of ideas inside and outside the classroom” has been sponsoring a series in the Crimson that invites selected faculty members to model civil disagreement for the rest of the university community by staging debates on questions like whether meritocracy or legacy status is a better principle around which to organize college admission. Over the course of the spring the university administration convened three blue-ribbon committees devoted in one way or another to promoting dialogue and civility.

Outside of all that my colleagues have written tens of thousands of words in national publications and the Crimson about “academic freedom” “civil discourse” and “institutional neutrality.” Most of them come with lists of proposed principles rules and codes almost all of which provide only a restrictive and marginal allowance for on-campus protest or at least these protests. Few propose a standard as asinine as pleasantness for suppressing dissident speech but almost all have treated the protests as a problem.

These efforts are united in the presumption that it is the protesters who need to be taught to behave not the professors and other campus leaders who accuse students critical of Israel of being “antisemitic in effect if not intent” or even (as the president of Harvard Chabad Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi put it) “below an animal…a monster.” But civil discourse and critical inquiry are not abstract concepts in the encampment. They are active principles: the pro-Palestinian students and the Israeli American professor having a conversation agreeing to disagree about some things finding common ground about others.

In the last six months Harvard’s administration has revived reinterpreted and selectively enforced Vietnam War–era rules governing campus protest. In the days before the encampment went up the undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee was decertified for violating a rule against cosponsoring events with unregistered student organizations including Jews 4 Palestine. Left unsaid was that the university had placed an embargo on the registration of new student organizations at the beginning of the fall semester. There was then no authorized way that J4P and the PSC could have organized events together—events that surely would have contributed to a climate of “civil discourse” and mutual understanding on the campus.

Virtually every tactic employed by the protesters in the encampment has been deployed before and tolerated at Harvard: unregistered assembly in public spaces amplified speeches even putting up tents and sleeping in the yard. In a recent example of disruptive (and arguably illegal) assembly more than a hundred students ran naked through the yard and around the encampment in Primal Scream an annual ritual celebrating the beginning of final exams. Once the words “Ceasefire Now” or “Free Palestine” are spoken however students’ on-campus gatherings become the subject of extraordinary attention concern regulation and threatened sanction. Indeed because the rules in question were effectively tightened by a new administrative “guidance” in the middle of January which interpreted the university’s Statement on Rights and Responsibilities to forbid a wide spectrum of assembly and protest there is an odd sort of circularity at work here: your protest broke the rules we just formalized to keep you from protesting.

There has been a great deal of discussion about proportional response. Most faculty who have spoken publicly hate the idea of deploying the police to break up the encampment. Even the former Harvard president Lawrence Summers said in the Crimson that he hopes the university will rely on its own disciplinary apparatus to address the encampment at least in the short run. The administration has so far resisted calls to redefine the violation of rules regulating campus decorum as a “clear and present danger” to public safety that can be resolved only by deploying the police.

The students in the encampment are of course aware of the difference between sanction imposed by deans and the deployment of riot police. (For quite a few of them it must be said a sanction that threatens their visa status or health care coverage or suddenly renders them unhoused is a good deal more serious than a trespassing charge even if enforced by university administrators rather than riot police.) Some have explained to me however that they ground their action not in the rules of the university or even in their constitutional rights to assembly and expression but in the ruling of the International Court of Justice in response to South Africa’s case against Israel. These students agree with the ICJ that some statements by Israeli government officials and some actions of the Israeli army constitute a persuasive case that there is a genocide occurring in Gaza. In their view by investing in companies that support the occupation and supply the Israeli military—and refusing to disclose what those investments are so that they might be reasonably discussed—Harvard has failed to take a stand in support of international law and against genocide and so they must."

CEO Jamie Dimon talked to some of JPMorgan's wealthy clients on a call Tuesday Yahoo reported.

He was said to have put the chances of a ""harder recession"" and of ""something worse"" at 20 to 30%.

He called current risks ""storm clouds"" an apparent downgrade from his June ""hurricane"" warning.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon estimated last week the probability that the US would head into a recession according to a Yahoo Finance report published Saturday.

Dimon reportedly said on a client call Tuesday that the economy was ""strong"" but ""storm clouds"" were on the horizon including federal monetary policies Russia's invasion of Ukraine and rising oil prices. The categorization is an apparent downgrade from Dimon's previous comments in June when he warned of an ""economic hurricane.""

""Consumers' balance sheets are in good shape"" he said per the Yahoo report. ""Businesses are equally in good shape. When you forecast you have to think differently. It is a bad mistake to say 'Here is my single-point forecast.'""

The CEO was said to have estimated the chances of a ""soft landing"" to be about 10% and the probability of a ""harder landing"" or ""mild recession"" to be closer to 20 to 30%. He also reportedly estimated a 20- to 30% chance of a ""harder recession"" and a 20- to 30% chance of ""something worse.""

Dimon had originally used the storm-clouds metaphor to describe the US economy back in April but his outlook grew more dire in June.

""I'm going to change the storm clouds out there. Look I'm an optimist I said there are storm clouds they're big storm clouds: It's a hurricane"" he said at the Bernstein conference on June 1 adding: ""You better brace yourself. JPMorgan is bracing ourselves and we're going to be very conservative with our balance sheet.""

Industry leaders like Dimon have provided various economic forecasts over the past few months as a strong US labor market clashes with two consecutive quarters of contraction — leaving many experts puzzled over whether the US is approaching a recession or is in one already.

""Right now it's kind of sunny"" Dimon said in June. ""Things are doing fine. Everyone thinks the Fed can handle this. That hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way. We just don't know if it's a minor one or Superstorm Sandy or Andrew or something like that.""

Dimon argued on the Tuesday call that remote work creates a working environment that’s less honest and more prone to procrastination. “A lot of people at home are texting each other sometimes saying what a jerk that person is” said Dimon. (His Hollywood Squares comment referred to the decades-old game show—that’s no longer in production—in which celebrities sat in a three-by-three grid to answer questions from contestants.)

Dimon’s remarks come as the tussle between management and employees on a return to the office heats up and a possible economic slowdown threatens to erode employees’ leverage to stay home.

In the past Dimon has said that work-from-home is a poor fit for JPMorgan’s employees. Last year he argued that remote work “doesn’t work for people who want to hustle doesn’t work for culture doesn’t work for idea generation.”

In a shareholder letter released earlier this year the bank said that it expected half its employees to return to the office full-time with an additional 40% working in a hybrid system. JPMorgan is reportedly tracking ID card swipes in order to ensure compliance with the new policy and monitoring the time employees spend on Zoom and email in order to better measure productivity.

On Tuesday Dimon rolled out a new argument in his battle against working from home: that it damages the U.S. drive for diversity.

Dimon called the office a “rainbow room” and said that workers who stayed home were denying themselves “opportunities to meet other people.” The JPMorgan CEO argued that “if you live in certain parts of our country and go eat out there it is all white” meaning remote workers may end up having a more uniform experience than if they traveled into work.

Studies report that minorities especially Black and Hispanic workers are teleworking at lower rates than white workers. One April study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 19% of Black and 14% of Hispanic workers engaged in telework compared with 24% of white workers and 38% of Asian workers. The CDC study argues that the difference stemmed from lower rates of college education among minority populations as well as overrepresentation of Black and Hispanic workers in jobs that don’t allow for remote work.

A survey from the Society for Human Resource Management last September reported that half of Black office workers wanted to work from home compared with 39% of white workers and 29% of Hispanic workers.

CEOs real estate developers and even city mayors have called for workers to return to the office. Developer Stephen Ross predicted in June that a recession might make “people fear that they might not have a job [and] that will bring people back to the office.” But workers want to stay home. The Slack-funded Future Forum found in July that only one in five knowledge workers wanted to return to the office a record low.

In 2020 something incredible happened in the dairy aisle: Velveeta started flying off the shelves.

Sales of the processed cheese product which food snobs love to hate have been in decline for years. Then the pandemic hit and suddenly stressed-out homebound people wanted Velveeta for their queso fudge and extra-cheesy mac and cheese. The sudden interest in the brand presented a rare chance to reintroduce itself to new customers and to those who hadn’t bought Velveeta in years.

“We recognized that as a great business opportunity” said Kelsey Rice senior brand communications manager for Velveeta.

Velveeta wanted to make a big swing not just to boost sales but to establish itself as part of the culture. “We think Velveeta is an iconic brand and it should be seen and viewed as such” she said.

To change its image Velveeta has had to change the way it talks about itself.

That means fewer commercials about affordable meltable cheese and more marketing stunts like cheese-scented nail polish and pricey Velveeta martinis.

A cheese star is born

Velveeta was born in 1918 according to the Smithsonian magazine. It was the brain child of a Swiss cheese maker named Emil Frey who developed the product from cheese scraps while working for the Monroe Cheese Company in Monroe New York. The Velveeta Cheese Company was incorporated in 1923 operating out of Monroe and was purchased by Kraft in 1927 according to the piece.

Asked about the brand’s history a representative pointed to a 2005 book published by Kraft called “The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Cheese” which states that Kraft introduced Velveeta in 1928 a year after funding research at Rutgers University about a processed cheese it was developing.

By the late 1920s Kraft was calling Velveeta a hit.

“Never in the history of our business have we offered the trade a cheese product that has made such an immediate success as Velveeta” said a 1929 ad aimed at retailers. “It seems to be a perfect product.”

Not only was Velveeta “delicious” and “healthful” the ad continued but it spread “like butter” and melted easily when cooked.

The brand’s marketing evolved with the times. An ad from the 1940s pointed to Velveeta as a smart war-time ingredient offering a recipe for Velveeta Pudding with Spanish Sauce “a hearty main dish that saves you ration points.”

A 1950s ad suggested to young mothers that “while you’re weight-watching and also trying to get your needed supply of milk nutrients make your desserts Velveeta and fresh fruit.”

By the 1970s Velveeta was a global phenomenon. A 1976 New York Times article called Velveeta a “worldwide favorite” adding that Kraft’s foreign sales grew 12% from 1974 to 1975 thanks in part to the product.

In the following decades American consumption of processed cheese continued to increase. In 1996 it hit a peak of 8.75 pounds of consumption per capita according to the USDA. Then things took a turn.

Not a food but a product

Two decades ago consumption started to fall. People worried about the health impacts of highly processed foods and started eating more natural cheese.

To make matters worse for Velveeta in 2002 the FDA sent a letter to Kraft warning that it could not use the term “pasteurized processed cheese spread” to describe Velveeta because it is made with milk protein concentrate. So Velveeta went from a cheese spread to a cheese product — today the company still makes Velveeta with milk protein concentrate and calls it a pasteurized recipe cheese product.

As consumer attitudes changed Velveeta began to evolve its advertising. Commercials showed Velveeta being used to create an easy side dish like cheese dip suitable for a party rather than dinner.

Even as it changed its marketing approach Velveeta stuck with a few clear messages. The product is easy to deal with. It’s affordable — Walmart’s website shows a 32-ounce package of Velveeta on sale for about $6.50. And most importantly it can melt.

Years after processed cheese came on the market it still melts better than natural cheeses such as cheddar noted Chad Galer vice president of food safety and product research at Dairy Management Inc. a dairy trade association. Processed cheese contain ingredients that allow it to melt into a type of gel when it heats up he explained. When natural cheese heats up oil seeps out giving it that globby texture.

“We’re trying to make natural cheese melt like Velveeta” Galer said. “But we haven’t unlocked that yet.”

That unique melting quality has been Velveeta’s advertising focus for most of its life said Rice. Now it’s trying something new.

Velveeta nail polish and martinis

In 2018 Velveeta sales fell about 4.5% to $1.1 billion from the year before according to IRI. In 2019 sales fell again — by about 2.4%.

But during the pandemic Velveeta benefited from people’s interest in comfort foods and easy-to-cook meals. In 2020 Velveeta sales surged by nearly 24%.

To take advantage of that movement the brand developed a new identity. In Rice’s words “Velveeta exists to make outrageous pleasure a way of life.” The brand updated its logo and launched a new ad campaign La Dolce Velveeta to support the change.

Then came the stunts.

In June Velveeta started selling a cheese-scented nail polish. More recently it unveiled the Veltini — a Velveeta martini made with cheese-infused vodka and sold at some restaurants or online.

The nail polish got some good reviews. The Veltini… not so much.

One Washington Post writer who ordered the drink at a restaurant said it looked “like a deranged cheese monster with olives as beady eyes and a dripping Velveeta cheese rim as a lopsided mouth.” The Today Show’s Hoda Kotb tried it on air reluctantly and was not a fan. “Yuck” she said “No girl no.” Her co-host Jenna Bush Hager said it wasn’t bad.

Bad reviews don’t really matter for Velveeta which is often the butt of the joke.

“Overall we’re really pleased with the way the world has received the Velveeta Veltini” said Rice. The most important thing is to get people to think about Velveeta again.

When brands make splashy marketing moves “people pay attention” said Bob Samples executive-in-residence at Western Michigan University where he teaches students about food and consumer goods marketing. “They go to the store they remember the name they buy it.”

So far Velveeta seems to be holding onto that pandemic boost. After dipping 1.1% in 2021 sales are up 3.2% through July of this year according to IRI.

The way Samples sees it Velveeta went from benefiting from pandemic trends to the high inflationary environment. Because Velveeta has a long shelf life it may be more appealing now as people try to avoid food waste to save money he said.

Plus new ad campaign or not people know what they’re getting when they buy Velveeta.

“People know what to expect” Samples said. There’s a “comfort feeling that goes with that.”",,,,,,,,,

Is your frozen dinner on this list of the worst ones?

We consulted two registered dietitians to help find the absolute worst frozen dinners you should stay away from right now. The experts are Amy Shapiro Registered dietitian and founder of Real Nutrition a nutrition company in NYC and Molly Hembree registered dietitian and Kroger dietitian. Both are members of the Eat This Not That! Medical Expert Board.

While some frozen dinners may be nutritious many are still processed meals with little to no nutrition or are so loaded with some not-so-good ingredients that it's just not worth it. Here they are and why these RDs made their choices.

6 Bacon Brands That Use The Lowest Quality Ingredients

Banquet Mega Bowls Chicken Fried Beef Steak Frozen Dinner

PER MEAL: 540 calories 33 g fat (11 g saturated fat 0.5 g trans fat) 1510 mg sodium 45 g carbs (4 g fiber 4 g sugar) 16 g protein

The sodium is what caught Hembree's attention with this frozen dinner. ""This comes in at an astonishing 1510mg sodium which actually exceeds most dietitians' daily sodium recommendations if you have kidney or heart health issues"" she says.

The ideal daily limit of sodium is 1500 milligrams or less according to the American Heart Association. One Banquet Mega Bowl Chicken Fried Steak frozen dinner puts you over that limit. Reducing your sodium intake can improve heart and blood pressure health.

Shapiro also chose this meal as one of the worst.

""Just like the other meals this one contains multiple preservatives which have been shown to be carcinogenic in the body excess sodium inflammatory oils and processed ingredients"" she notes.

""It is also high in saturated fat coming in at 55% of our daily value. But this has .5 g of trans fats which have been shown to increase bad cholesterol and decrease good cholesterol"" she adds. ""Trans fats have been mostly banned in the US so having it in this meal is truly an unhealthy marker.""

Banquet Mega Bowls Frozen Dynamite Penne & Meatballs

PER MEAL: 590 calories 27 g fat (9 g saturated fat 1 g trans fat) 1150 mg sodium 61 g carbs (5 g fiber 7 g sugar) 24 g protein

The second one on our list of frozen dinners to skip is another from Banquet. ""This meal not only contains more sodium than you need in a day. It also has limited fiber processed ingredients and and mechanically separated chicken which means you are getting not just chicken but tendons veins bones and other things you don't realize you are eating"" Shapiro says.

She adds there are ""inflammatory oils processed soy preservatives and multiple gums making this an unhealthy choice for anyone to select.""

Fiber is an essential part of your daily diet. According to the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 the daily amount of fiber is 22 to 34 grams a day depending on your age and sex.

Hungry-Man Boneless Fried Chicken Frozen Meal

PER MEAL: 820 calories 39 g fat (12 g saturated fat 0.5 g trans fat) 1130 mg sodium 86 g carbs (5 g fiber 22 g sugar) 32 g protein

The high calories are a red flag in this Hungry-Man frozen dinner. Shapiro points out that she recommends frozen meals under 600 calories.

""It also contains almost an entire day's worth of sodium in one serving. Finally there are multiple preservatives including BHT and MSG which can affect your overall health as well as gums processed forms of soy mechanically separated chicken and excess fat per serving in this meal"" she says.

Devour Frozen Chicken Cordon Bleu Mac & Cheese

PER MEAL: 480 calories 23 g fat (10 g saturated fat 0.5 g trans fat) 1120 mg sodium 34 g carbs (2 g fiber 4 g sugar) 36 g protein

It may not be a surprise that a chicken cordon bleu meal with mac and cheese isn't a good option but what is it that makes it unhealthy?

""With 10 grams of saturated fat in just one meal this product if eaten regularly could increase risk for many chronic diseases"" Hembree states.

The American Heart Association recommends a limit of about 13 grams of saturated fat each day depending on your total daily calorie need. This meal brings you extremely close to that limit not leaving much room for other meals and snacks with even a little saturated fat.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Sukhi's Frozen Chicken Tikka Masala Naanwich

PER one container: 300 calories 8 g fat (2 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 610 mg sodium 43 g carbs (1 g fiber 6 g sugar) 17 g protein

This is another frozen dinner that is not one experts recommend.

""This product has a measly 1 gram fiber per package. A product like this I would expect to have at least 3 grams of fiber and would have liked to see at least a full vegetable serving in the sandwich filling"" Hembree says.

Michelina's Fettuccine Alfredo Frozen Meal

PER MEAL: 250 calories 8 g fat (3.5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 690 mg sodium 37 g carbs (2 g fiber 4 g sugar) 8 g protein

How many times have you eaten something that you thought was good for you only to learn later that it wasn't? This cheap frozen dinner might look deceiving.

""I am selecting this one because it seems innocent at about 250 calories and it is vegetarian friendly however it is full of chemicals artificial flavors preservatives including BHT and BHA (banned in other countries) and it is white flour without much fiber which means it will not hold you over for very long and soon enough you'll be finding yourself eating again"" says Shapiro.

No one wants to be hungry too soon after a meal.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“If you know the song sing it with me” he said.

Wearing plaid pants and a long-sleeved shirt white sunglasses and rocking braids the Puerto Rican artist immediately blessed fans with his Chencho Corleone-assisted “Me Porto Bonito” which is currently in its 12th week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart.

For about the first 30 minutes Bad Bunny was alone on the stage — sitting on a beach chair surrounded by palm trees sand and his cooler — transmitting the exact vibe of his conceptual album “a summer without you.” He then performed “Un Ratito” and the TikTok viral “Efecto.”

“Good evening Miami welcome to the World’s Hottest Tour” he greeted the fans. “Thank you for being here. This is another highlight of my career and all I ask is for you to have a great time and walk away from here with a nice memory. You are the most important part of this tour without you I wouldn’t exist. Without you this concert wouldn’t be a party.”

The artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio was then joined onstage by his inclusive 20-member dance crew to perform other bangers such as “Party” “La Corriente” and “Neverita” which he fused with EDM versions of his tracks “Ni Bien Ni Mal” “200 Mph” “La Romana” “Estamos Bien” “Otra Noche en Miami” and “Chambea.”

Bad Bunny then transitioned from his summer-themed album to his studio sets YHLQMDLG and El Ultimo Tour del Mundo where he performed “Si Veo a Tu Mama” “La Dificil” “Bichiyal” “La Santa” “Una Vez” (with special guest Mora) “Vete” “Yo Perreo Sola” and “Safaera” (with special guest Ñengo Flow).

After a very hyped performance of his dembow “Titi Me Pregunto” Bunny was joined onstage by longtime collaborator Jhayco to perform their singles “Tarot” and “Dakiti.”

“I had an amazing summer in Puerto Rico” Bunny told the crowd “I hope my music is part of yours.”

He then performed “Yonaguni” and “Callaita” before surprising his loyal fans with the ultimate “Trap Bunny” set including “Diles” “No Te Hagas” “Vuelve” “Tu no metes cabra” “Chambea” and “Soy Peor.”

“For my fans since day one from ‘Diles’ to ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’ thank you. This all started as a dream for me and now I’m selling out stadiums” he said.

One of the most notable parts of the show was when the artist hopped on a floating island that took him around the Hard Rock Stadium filled with about 60000 spectators. There he performed the very heartfelt bops “Un Coco” and “La Cancion.”

After a two-hour presentation Bunny topped off the night with his feel-good reggae “Me Fui de Vacaciones” the romantic “Ojitos Lindos” the very prideful “El Apagón” and his fast-paced mambo “Despues de la Playa.”

“Wherever I go I’m always going to be proud of being Boricua. They say I’m No. 1 but honestly the No. 1’s here are all of you” he said before signing off at around 11:30 p.m.

Elvis Presley Fans are currently celebrating Elvis Week to commemorate the anniversary of the King's death. The star who died on August 16 1977 was found at his home in Graceland Memphis Tennessee by his fiancée Ginger Alden. His daughter Lisa Marie Presley was just next door. When the King was at his best however he was constantly on the lookout for new emerging talent in the music industry. And Priscilla Presley the star's ex-wife knew exactly what kind of musician he adored to watch.

Elvis knew when music worked and when it didn't however. Priscilla revealed in her memoir Elvis and Me that a specific style of musician irked him. She recalled: ""He couldn’t abide singers who were in his words: 'all technique and no emotional feeling.'"" Elvis even name-dropped some singers who he thought were all flair and no substance.

In this category of the singer without any feeling Elvis ""firmly placed Mel Tormé and Robert Goulet"". These kinds of singers were condemned in Elvis' home Graceland. So much so that he would attack the TV if they appeared on it. ""[Tormé and Goulet] were both responsible for two television sets being blown away with a .357 Magnum"" Priscilla revealed. It wasn't a personal issue though. Elvis was simply passionate about music and talent - something he had a great eye for she revealed.

The aerial unit of arms manufacturing conglomerate Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Aeronautics has won a contract that would see its pockets grow more than $7.6 billion deeper according to the Pentagon.

The deal is a US Navy modification contract under which Lockheed Martin will produce 129 new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets the US Department of Defense announced.

""Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. Fort Worth Texas is awarded a not-to-exceed $7630940571... contract"" the Defense Department said in a press release on Friday. ""This modification increases the ceiling to procure 129 Lot 15 aircraft.""

The order includes F-35A aircraft for the US Air Force; three F-35B aircraft and ten F-35C aircraft for the Marine Corps; 15 F-35C aircraft for the US Navy; 32 F-35A aircraft and four F-35B aircraft for non-Defense Department participants; and 16 F-35A aircraft for Foreign Military Sales customers the release added.

Around 57% of the work on the contract will be performed in Forth Worth Texas 14% in El Segundo California and 9% in Warton the United Kingdom the release also said.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said in January it had sued to stop the acquisition of the country's last independent supplier of missile propulsion systems over concerns that Lockheed would use its leverage to harm rival defense contractors. One month later Lockheed Martin scrapped a $4.4 billion deal to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne after the FTC moved to block it.

Lockheed Martin however is still conducting business as usual with Washington as it handed over its first operational Multiple Rocket Launch System (MLRS) to the US Army the company announced in mid-July.

According to the arms conglomerate the MLRS can be carried on heavy military airlift carriers and they are designed to destroy artillery air defense concentrations trucks light armor and personnel carrier at distances further than previously possible while having the ability to relocate at high speed.

Two days after the handover the US announced that it launched two hypersonic missiles manufactured by the company in light of mounting concerns that China and Russia have had more success manufacturing and developing their own homemade hypersonic weapons.

The latest time period has seen the US conduct successful hypersonic weapons tests in a change from its usual failures raising questions about cost and increasing concerns that Washington has been failing in what is now dubbed a superpower arms race.

Arms manufacturers like Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies have all touted their hypersonic weapons programs to investors in a bid to further benefit from wars and the shift to the new arms race in light of surging tensions around the globe.

M270 MLRSs are among the weapons handed out to Kiev as part of the influx of western arms to the country in light of the Ukraine war. However Ukraine has been found to be selling weapons it acquired from the West on the black market due to the Kiev forces' limited ability to use them because of their lack of training logistical challenges and the diminishing size of the Ukrainian armed forces as per former Pentagon advisor Karen Kwiatkowski.

At the start of June the White House announced that the United States was sending a new batch of military supplies to Ukraine. The new batch of arms supply is worth $450 million in shipments.

Though the United States has been taking care of providing training for the Ukrainian soldiers when it comes to arms they are not accustomed to Kiev is still selling its arms to the black market due to ""inexperience"".

Even the HIMARS are likely to be sold US defense officials have said though Pentagon policy chief Colin Kahl said Kiev's forces recently completed training on HIMARS delivered to Ukraine by Washington and London.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJpdHlhZmZhaXJzLmNvbS8xMzQzNDEvaGFja2luZy9raWxsbmV0LWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi5odG1s0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9zZWN1cml0eWFmZmFpcnMuY29tLzEzNDM0MS9oYWNraW5nL2tpbGxuZXQtbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLmh0bWw_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Killnet claims to have breached Lockheed Martin,"Killnet claims to have breached Lockheed Martin

Pierluigi Paganini August 13 2022 August 13 2022

Russian hacker group Killnet claims to have launched a DDoS attack on the aerospace and defense giant Lockheed Martin.

The Moscow Times first reported that the Pro-Russia hacker group Killnet is claiming responsibility for a recent DDoS attack that hit the aerospace and defense giant Lockheed Martin.

The Killnet group also claims to have stolen data from a Lockheed Martin employee and threatened to share it.

The group has been active since March it launched DDoS attacks against governments that expressed support to Ukraine including Italy Romania Moldova the Czech Republic Lithuania Norway and Latvia.

In a video shared by the group on Telegram the group claimed to have stolen the personal information of the Lockheed Martin employees including names email addresses phone numbers and pictures.

The group also shared two spreadsheets containing a message in Russian:

“If you have nothing to do you can email Lockheed Martin Terrorists – photos and videos of the consequences of their manufactured weapons! Let them realize what they create and what they contribute to.” (Tanslated with Google).

At this time it is impossible to determine the real source of these data. Lockheed Martin is aware of the Killnet claims but it did not comment on them.

The contract includes 49 F-35A (conventional take-off) aircraft for the US Air Force three F-35B (short take-off and vertical landing) aircraft and 10 F-35C (aircraft carrier variant) aircraft for the Marine Corps.

Also included are 15 F-35Cs for the US Navy 32 F-35A aircraft and four F-35B aircraft for non-US Department of Defense participants and 16 F-35A aircraft for foreign customers.

The Pentagon contract announcement said work under this modification is expected to be completed in October 2024.

In a separate notice the Pentagon said Lockheed Martin was also being awarded a $53.4 million modification for “continued engineering and other related activities in support of the design and development of a Joint Strike Fighter aircraft variant tailored for an unspecified foreign military sales (FMS) customer.”

The Pentagon did not reveal the customer but it is worth noting that Israel is working on a special variant of the F-35 that will allow the Israeli Air Force to uniquely integrate certain indigenous technologies into the F-35. Israel received the first of these one-off airframes in 2020.

According to the latest Lockheed Martin factsheet on the F-35 program the company has delivered over 825 airframes to nine nations. The global fleet has amassed over 550000 flight hours with over 323000 sorties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2l0cy1yYWluaW5nLWYtMzVzLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1iYWdzLTEyOS1uZXctZmlnaHRlci1qZXRzL9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2l0cy1yYWluaW5nLWYtMzVzLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1iYWdzLTEyOS1uZXctZmlnaHRlci1qZXRzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It’s Raining F-35s! Lockheed Martin Bags A Whopping $7.6 Billion Contract For 129 New Stealth Fighter Jets – US DOD,"The US Department of Defense (DoD) has announced that Lockheed Martin Aeronautics has been awarded a modification contract of over $7.6 billion from the US Navy to build 129 new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.

“Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. Fort Worth Texas is awarded a not-to-exceed $7630940571… contract” the Defense Department said in a press release on Friday. “This modification increases the ceiling to procure 129 Lot 15 aircraft.”

This modification increases the ceiling to procure 129 Lot 15 aircraft as follows: 49 F-35A aircraft for the Air Force; three F-35B aircraft and 10 F-35C aircraft for the Marine Corps; 15 F-35C aircraft for the Navy; 32 F-35A aircraft and four F-35B aircraft for non-U.S Department of Defense (DOD) participants; and sixteen F-35A aircraft for Foreign Military Sales customers as well as 69 shipsets of technical hardware.

More than half of the contract’s work will be done in Fort Worth Texas (57%) 14% in El Segundo California and 9% in Warton United Kingdom.

The US Department of Defense earlier agreed with Lockheed Martin Corp on July 18 to build about 375 F-35 fighter jets over three years EurAsian Times had reported. The agreement was signed amid expectations that the price of F-35A would increase due to inflation and slower production.

The new announcement however comes at a time when the aerospace giant’s production facilities have come under the scanner. Lockheed Martin Corp has delivered more than 800 F-35 fighter jets.

However Pentagon’s Defense Contract Management Agency states that manufacturing is still plagued with excessive defects and rework that run the danger of significant delivery delays and decreased readiness.

From the first production lot of the F-35 to the current 14th batch Lockheed the Defense Department’s top contractor has improved in many ways. But “too many quality assurance defects” aren’t found at the initial assembly station and are discovered before or after the formal acceptance of the warplanes.

There has been a significant uptick in purchasing the F-35 fighter jets across variants. It is only fair that the aerospace giant records almost 27% revenue from the F-35 Lightning II aircraft alone which is set to rise given the current and potential sales driven by the Russian war.

Renewed Demand For F-35s

A few days ago the F-35s were in the eye of the storm after being grounded by the US Air Force. The US Navy also stated that the manufacturer had identified the specific production lots of Cartridge Actuated Devices (CADs) used in Martin-Baker ejection seats as problematic.

Pilots pulling the ejection handle cause the CADs to participate in the parachute deployment.

On July 29 media sources claimed that the Navy had also grounded its fleet; however the US Navy and Marine Corps later stated that their F-35 fighters were not grounded. All inspections had been mostly finished by their fleets.

Despite facing several problems the F-35 program is up and running. Recent contract wins for Lockheed Martin include many jet fighter orders from countries including Germany Finland and Switzerland.

Not too long ago the Czech Republic announced that it had decided to buy the F-35s while Greece and some other nations have expressed interest in purchasing F-35 fighter jets in the future.

The fifth-generation stealthy F-35 jet the best-selling warplane in the world has seen considerable sales growth due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

In government-to-government transactions like the F-35 international military sales the Pentagon acts as a middleman between the defense contractor (Lockheed) and a foreign government.

Until now the Lockheed Martin F-35 program has never participated in a competitive auction against other jets maybe due to the exceptional capabilities of the fighter jet and the political clout that the United States wields globally.

The announcement to buy new units of the fighter is also significant as it was earlier revealed in a House Armed Sevice Committee (HASC) that the US Navy will have to operate with far fewer combat fighter aircraft than it needs for the next decade through to 2031. At the time it was said that far fewer F-35 jets than planned would be delivered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmRhdGFuZXdzLmNvbS9sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tYXdhcmRlZC03LTYtYmlsbGlvbi1jb250cmFjdC10by1wcm9kdWNlLTEyOS1mLTM1LWZpZ2h0ZXItamV0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin awarded $7.6 billion contract to produce 129 F-35 fighter jets,"The US Department of Defense awarded Lockheed Martin a new contract to purchase 129 F-35 Lightning II fighter jets on August 12. Part of Lot 15 the order is capped at $7.63 billion and is expected to be completed by October 2024.

Most of the fighters will be delivered to the Air Force (USAF) which will receive 49 F-35As. The US Navy (USN) will have 15 more F-35Cs a naval variant of the stealth jet while the Marines will have another 10 F-35Cs in addition to three F-35Bs with V/STOL performance.

The US government also authorized the production of 32 F-35As and four F-35Bs for US allies in addition to 16 F-35As under the Foreign Military Sales program. The nations that will receive the aircraft were not detailed.

Assembly of the F-35s will take place at Lockheed Martin’s facility in Fort Worth Texas.

In the previous 14 batches the US manufacturer has already produced more than 800 F-35 fighter jets which has been winning several new contracts in Germany Switzerland Finland and Canada.

Despite this the combat aircraft continues to present problems in its assembly such as the grounding of hundreds of them weeks ago after possible defects in the seat ejection mechanism were found."

Additional checks revealed Lowes also suffered a small fracture to the top of his left humerus bone (Greater Tuberosity fracture) and the 31-year-old has commenced an intensive rehabilitation with the aim to be back on his Kalex machine for the Aragon Grand Prix in Spain on September 18.

Joining Tony Arbolino for the next two races is exciting young Australian prospect Senna Agius. The 17-year-old from Sydney started his racing career in dirt track and motocross before graduating to road racing where he contested the Asia Talent Cup and Junior World Championship.

He is currently showing great potential in the European Moto2 series riding a Kalex machine for the PromoRacing Team. Agius is currently third in the standings with six podiums in eight rounds and he was victorious in both races earlier this season at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.

Senna Agius said: “Firstly I’d like to wish Sam a speedy recovery. I would also like to say a huge thank you to the Elf Marc VDS Racing Team for giving me this opportunity to make my debut in the Moto2 World Championship. I can’t wait to get started at the Austrian Grand Prix. This is a big childhood dream of mine and I’m very excited to accomplish it with such an amazing team to learn from.

Growing up he cut his hair like Cruyff; in his first spell as president at Barcelona the Dutchman who changed the club and the game like no one else was his advisor an ideologue and spiritual leader.

And now in Laporta’s second spell he still is even after his passing. “I always have Johan with me because of all he taught; deep down he’s still guiding us” Laporta says.

Cruyff’s son Jordi is the club’s sporting director and there is a recurring question that those touched by Cruyff ask often especially in moments of uncertainty: what would Johan say?

One of Cruyff’s most famous maxims was “the money on the pitch not in the bank”. As it turned out that advice has not proven simple. Last Sunday 83021 people packed the Camp Nou for the Gamper trophy Barcelona’s traditional presentation game and watched a hugely impressive demolition of Pumas optimism flooding back. It was a first exciting glimpse of a new era and new signings: Robert Lewandowski Raphinha Franck Kessié and Andreas Christensen and Jules Koundé. Six days on there were fears that when the season starts against Rayo Vallecano tonight they wouldn’t get a second. In the end only Koundé will not be there.

Including variables Lewandowski cost Barcelona €50m. Koundé’s cost could rise to €62.5m and Raphinha’s total fee should reach around €70m.

There was also the re-signing of Ousmane Dembélé on €16m plus variables per season a fortnight after he had become a free agent and six months after being told to leave.

This summer no one has spent more than Barcelona and they continue to pursue other signings including a right-back Marcos Alonso and Bernardo Silva. All of which poses a question: how?

How could a club €1.3bn in debt whose salary limit was set at minus €144m in March and returned losses of over €400m last year a club described by its own directors as “clinically dead” and then “in intensive care” field a team like this?

The short answer is: they couldn’t not until less than 24 hours before their opening game of the season. And even then Koundé was still waiting to be included as Barcelona seek to complete their bid to make sufficient cuts by reducing salaries or moving players out or bring in enough money to comply fully with La Liga’s financial fair play criteria and register all their players. An automated system that is preventative rather than punitive far from Barcelona being allowed to get away with doing whatever they want as the ill-informed complaint has it – remember Lionel Messi? – La Liga has the strictest control in Europe. Based on income and outgoings a limite salarial is set by the league that defines what a club can spend on its playing staff across transfers salaries and amortisations and if it does not comply it simply cannot register on the system.

That explains in large part the way they have moved over the last two months and why on Friday night against the clock they had managed to register Lewandowski Christensen Raphinha Kessié Dembélé and Sergi Roberto but not yet Koundé providing a portrait of the difficulties they face and the risk they take how fine the margins are as Laporta tries to kickstart what he refers to as a virtuous cycle pulling Barcelona from the crisis he inherited.

Others are less convinced concerned at the consequences doubtful that this can really be a solution long term or angry at what they see as the lack of them. Earlier in the summer Julian Nagelsmann Bayern Munich’s head coach insisted Barcelona were the “only club in the world that have no money but then buy all the players they want. It’s a bit strange a bit crazy. I don’t know how they do it.”

Here is how although whether it is a good idea or is being applied in the best manner is another issue. When Laporta took over the presidency last year one of his first moves was to take out a €500m loan from Goldman Sachs that enabled them to restructure their debt. Then there are what Barcelona call palancas or levers. It is a word that has not just entered into the lexicon but almost entered into some kind of footballing folklore and has eclipsed all else over the last couple of months the summer spent imagining Laporta standing in front of some heaving machine sweating and frantically pulling at levers.

There have been a lot of them a lot of signings too. Every time one thought surely that must be it now another player turned up and another lever was pulled down. Just when one was convinced they could not buy any more they did. And they have not finished yet; at least that is what they hope. There are still 20 days left to open up more margin for more signings.

In essence pulling palancas means selling assets raising cash against future earnings to balance the books. Usually for a football club that would mean players but it is not so easy to do when the few sellable players one has are not that keen to go and so Barcelona have looked elsewhere.

The first palanca came in late June with the sale of 10% of their La Liga TV rights over the next 25 years to a company called Sixth Street. The second arrived three weeks later with a further 15% going to Sixth Street for €315m. At the current value of the TV deal €166m a year that would mean handing over a total of €1037.5m over 25 years — bread for today hunger for tomorrow some fear — but Barcelona said the deals would bring a capital gain of €667m immediately.

The third palanca came at the start of August with the sale of just under 24.5% of Barca Studios the club’s content production company to crypto company Socios for €100m. And the planned fourth would see another 24.5% of Barca Studios go to investment fund GDA Luma for €100m. As it turned out on Friday that deal was instead announced with Orpheus Media owned by Jaume Roures whose Mediapro company are La Liga’s broadcast partner. At the members’ assembly the Barcelona board had also been given authority to sell up to 49.9% of the club’s merchandise and licensing arm BLM.

All the while they continued trying to cut costs seeking departures for players and salary reductions for those who stay. Philippe Coutinho Clément Lenglet and Óscar Mingueza were among those to leave. Samuel Umtiti is trying to secure an exit.

Pressure was brought to bear on Martin Braithwaite and most notably on Frenkie de Jong who was told to leave or accept a 50% reduction on a salary that with amortisation will cost Barcelona over €30m next year. He is already owed €18m on deferred payments. There was even a letter from the club informing him that the extension he had signed under the previous regime might be part of a raft of four renewals they claim were fraudulent – seen by De Jong’s camp as an unsubtle attempt to strong arm him out. He though continues to insist on his desire to continue even as things turn toxic.

When Barcelona presented Koundé Laporta claimed that having also signed a new sponsorship deal with Spotify worth around €70m a year Barcelona had raised €868m in just two months. “We think we can register the players with everything we have done” he said. “The risk is controlled: we did it to save the club and to sign players. Hopefully we don’t have to pull any more levers. If there’s a situation that obliges us to we will consider it. Interpreting the fair play rules has its complexities. I hope our interpretation is the same as the league’s”.

It was not and so they had to pull more. The league did not accept the calculation on the first two palancas judging that Barcelona had used €150m of their own money to inflate the value of the deals and told them that they still did not reach the threshold where they could freely register players. After all the gap from the minus €144m limite salarial they had been at in March the last time figures were public and the €560m salary mass they actually had was huge. And that mass had increased over the summer. On Friday the fourth lever was pulled Roures coming to the rescue.

That paperwork was presented to the league for verification with the exception of Koundé in time for Saturday night. Barcelona were also briefing that their calculations suggested they would need a further €20m or €30m to register all their players in time for the opening night of the season and beyond. Good news came just after 9.30pm less than 24 hours before their league bow. There is though more work to be done and longer term issues to consider.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who came only in January might be the next one out. Memphis Depay who was registered just in time for the opening day last season but only after Gerard Piqué took a pay cut to get Barcelona under the limit and whose No 9 shirt was given to Lewandowski could follow him. And still De Jong resists.

If there are sales it is unlikely they will be completed and cleared in time for Saturday. Meanwhile Piqué who reportedly has over €50m in salary pending has been approached to accept further cuts as have Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba.

The pressure builds but with the clock ticking a solution was found and the season starts with the money on the pitch. Some of it at least.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2thdGh5LW1hZS1tY2FkYW1zLXdoaXNuYW50LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MjI1MzMz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kathy Mae McAdams Whisnant Obituary (2022) - Burlington NC - Lowe Funeral Home & Crematory Inc.,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/kathy-mae-mcadams-whisnant-obituary?id=36225333 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2thdGh5LW1hZS1tY2FkYW1zLXdoaXNuYW50LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MjI1MzMz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vZ2hvc3RidXN0ZXJzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9uZXctZ2hvc3RidXN0ZXJzLWxlZC1zaGFkb3ctbGlnaHQtaXMtdGhpcy15ZWFycy1tdXN0LWhhdmUtaGFsbG93ZWVuLWRlY29yYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Ghostbusters LED shadow light is this year's must-have Halloween decoration!,"Something strange is in the neighborhood but luckily for Ghostbusters fans it looks good as a brand new LED shadow light has been found on store shelves!

Preston's Brad Potts has already beaten his strike tally for the whole of last season - and he is unlikely to ever score a better goal than the one he registered in Saturday's win at Luton Town.

The North End midfielder only notched once in the 2021-22 campaign but after scoring midweek in an EFL Cup tie at Huddersfield he followed it up with a stunning goal at Kenilworth Road.

The 28-year-old applied an acrobatic scissor kick finish that flew into the top corner giving Hatters' stopper Ethan Horvath absolutely no chance. That was the only goal of the game and proved a more than worthy winner as Ryan Lowe's side move up to seventh in the Championship.

The quality of Potts' goal had plenty of people comparing it to similar strikes from years gone by. That included Paolo Di Canio's effort for West Ham against Wimbledon in 2000 and going even further back Marco van Basten's legendary effort for the Netherlands against Soviet Union in the final of Euro 1988.

Jamie Mackie a pundit on ITV's EFL coverage said of Potts' goal: ""I don't even want to put another label on it. He's got the height and the athleticism to get up on the shoulder of the defender who is covering there. We know Robbie Brady has got quality and will put a good ball in but you don't expect someone to come in like that at the back post. What a fantastic goal. We might not see many better this season than that.""

And the strike certainly had fans purring on social media. One wrote: ""Unlikely to see a better goal technically all season. Take a bow Brad Potts."" Another said: ""Haaland has Brad Potts posters on his bedroom wall.""

A third put: ""Never seen brad Potts score a normal goal - what a finish.""

Lowe speaking post-match said of the strike: ""I haven't seen it back yet! I just remember seeing him with his two legs in the air and I wondered what he was doing.

""And next thing it hits the back of the net! He has had great goal scoring attributes all his career and it was wing-back to wing-back. He is off the mark with two goals now.""

On the game in general Lowe added: ""The performance was okay. We scored a fantastic goal and defended very good. We managed the game - you can't come here and go toe-to-toe with them because we have to respect a good Luton team who just missed out on the Premier League. We found a way today to take three points against a very good team. We know what Nathan's team is about - they are relentless. We needed a bit of luck along the way but the performance was good enough. The attitude and application was spot on."""

VA improperly approved almost $11M in bonuses to senior executives watchdog says

Department of Veterans Affairs officials improperly approved nearly $11 million in bonuses to senior executives intended for other workers a department watchdog said in a new report.

The money was recently allocated by Congress and intended to be used to recruit ""critical skill"" employees but ended up in the hands of senior executives in the VA's central Washington office according to an inspector general's report posted Thursday.

The funds authorized by the Pact Act were meant to be incentives in hiring and retaining specialists needed to process billion in new benefits for veterans dealing with health issues from being exposed to burn pits. Agent Orange and other toxic hazards.

The IG report said the money was paid instead as bonuses to more than 180 senior executives last year with several taking home more than $100000.

The average bonus paid out was over $55000 the report said.

The Washington Post first reported the results of the inspector general's investigation.

The IG said the improperly approved bonuses were due in part to breakdowns in leadership and controls at multiple levels of the VA.

The IG recommended the ""Secretary of Veterans Affairs or his designee takes appropriate action to determine whether individuals involved in the decision-making process ... had any actual or apparent conflicts of interest and develop a process to ensure all decision-makers are free from conflicts when awarding future incentives.""

When Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough in September ordered the executives to return the money most did or agreed to do so but 19 have challenged having to repay the bonuses the IG report said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2J1c2luZXNzL2V4eG9uLW9yZGVyZWQtdG8tcGF5LTcyNW0tdG8tbWVjaGFuaWMtd2hvLWNsYWltZWQtdG94aWMtY2hlbWljYWxzLWNhdXNlZC1jYW5jZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon ordered to pay $725M to mechanic who claimed toxic chemicals caused cancer,"A Pennsylvania jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay $725.5 million to a former mechanic who claimed toxic chemicals in the company’s gasoline and solvents caused his cancer according to attorneys for the plaintiff.

The 10-2 verdict came on Thursday attorneys said after a trial in a state court in Philadelphia where former mechanic Paul Gill alleged he was exposed to benzene in ExxonMobil products while working at a gas station between 1975 and 1980.

Following the trial that lasted just over a week the jury found Exxon liable for negligently failing to warn about the health risks of benzene which the Environmental Protect Agency has classified as a known carcinogen.

The entire verdict was in compensatory damages according to Gill’s attorneys.

An Exxon spokesperson called the verdict “irrational” and said the company would ask the court to reverse it and that it planned to “exhaust all available appeals.”

The 67-year-old former mechanic said in his 2020 lawsuit that he used petroleum products to clean car parts with his bare hands which exposed him to benzene through direct skin contact and inhalation.

He was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia a type of blood cancer in 2019.

“This verdict is important because it’s a finding that their gasoline causes cancer” said Patrick Wigle an attorney for Gill in a statement. “ExxonMobil has known for decades that benzene causes cancer yet they resisted warning the public and taking basic precautions to warn the public and limit exposure.”

“This verdict is important because it’s a finding that their gasoline causes cancer” said Patrick Wigle an attorney for Gill. Christopher Sadowski

Benzene is widely used in the United States in motor fuels as a solvent for resins and plastics and for other industrial purposes.

The EPA which limits the amount of benzene that is acceptable in fuels says it also can be found in emissions from burning coal and oil from car exhaust and from evaporation at gas stations among other things.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMTIwNTU0LW1pa2UtdHlzb24tdnMtamFrZS1wYXVsLXRpY2tldHMtc2V0LWF0LTJtLWZvci12aXAtcGFja2FnZS1mb3ItbmV0ZmxpeC1ib3hpbmctZmlnaHTSAY8BaHR0cHM6Ly9zeW5kaWNhdGlvbi5ibGVhY2hlcnJlcG9ydC5jb20vYW1wLzEwMTIwNTU0LW1pa2UtdHlzb24tdnMtamFrZS1wYXVsLXRpY2tldHMtc2V0LWF0LTJtLWZvci12aXAtcGFja2FnZS1mb3ItbmV0ZmxpeC1ib3hpbmctZmlnaHQuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul Tickets Set at $2M for VIP Package for Netflix Boxing Fight,"Christian Petersen/Getty Images

Mike Tyson and Jake Paul are hoping they aren't the only heavy hitters coming to Dallas this summer.

Paul's Most Valuable Promotions announced a series of VIP ticket packages for the July 20 prize fight Thursday including one package that will run $2 million. The $2 million package dubbed the MVP Owner's Experience will offer two ringside apron seats never before offered in boxing.

The VIP package also includes four first-row floor seats and four second-row floor seats along with a pre-fight photo with Paul and Tyson and gloves signed by both fighters.

""We're trying to bring awareness and exposure back to boxing in a gigantic way. That has not been the case for many many years"" MVP co-founder Nakisa Bidarian said per Jessica Golden of CNBC.

Tyson and Paul are set for a heavyweight prizefight at AT&T Stadium on July 20. The fight will be an officially sanctioned fight after initially being billed as an exhibition.

Tyson last fought Roy Jones Jr. in a November 2020 exhibition. His last professional bout was a June 2005 loss to Kevin McBride. The 19 years between professional boxing matches is unheard of but we're in a new era in the sport.

Tyson Jones Evander Holyfield and several legends have come out of retirement for pay checks in recent years due to the growth of the celebrity boxing trend.

Paul who became famous from Vine and YouTube is the face of the movement. He began his career with a fight against streamer Ali Eson Gib in 2020 and then knocked out Nate Robinson on the Tyson-Jones undercard later that year. From there Paul's boxing career launched into the stratopshere making him one of the most bankable names in the sport.

As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight."

Bull Or Bear Market? Who Is Right?

Bull or bear market. As noted last week the race to call the bottom is on.

“Despite the Fed hiking rates shrinking their balance sheet and inflation at 9% much of the financial media and market gurus have determined that the bear market is over and a new bull market has started.”

However as we will review this week there is data supporting both bull or bear market arguments. The challenging part for investors will be navigating the markets safely over the next few months until the “tale is told.” Before we get to the bull or bear market analysis let’s review the action from the past week.

While the markets were consolidating recent gains over the last week or so the weaker-than-expected CPI print on Wednesday as expected sent stocks surging. While the print came in softer than expected the annual inflation rate remains very high keeping the Fed focused on the “inflation fight” for now. Notably the high inflation levels which won’t come down quickly will eat into corporate profit margins over time leading companies to take on more defensive tactics to maintain profitability.

Ira Jersey via Bloomberg had one of the most relevant statements regarding inflation:

“Our analysis shows that the lower-volatility (read sticky) components of core CPI may have peaked in July but the medium-volatility sector continues to jump higher. If the low-volatility cluster stabilizes at this higher level these combined trends may keep core CPI underpinned and the Fed hawkish…. The better-than-expected core CPI print will be a strong positive for the Treasury market particularly the long end so the knee-jerk reaction is unsurprising. The strong steepening of the curve may not last however as the better-than-expected core still doesn’t mean it will fall. In fact although better than expected the core may be sticker than the market seems to be anticipating.”

However in the short-term the softer CPI reading emboldened the bulls on hopes the Fed may be closer to the end of its rate hiking campaign potentially paving the way for future cuts. There is a bullish bias to the market with sentiment improving sharply in recent weeks. With the market clearing the 100-dma and the 20-dma crossing above the 50-dma precise short-term support levels will provide better entry points for increasing trading positions. While the market is pushing a rather extreme deviation above the 50-dma the 200-dma is acting as a magnet for investors which will likely be achieved next week.

However the question that we will debate today is the longer-term bull or bear market view.

The Bullish Case

Much of the bullish case is predicated on the hope the Federal Reserve is closer to reinstating monetary accommodation. As Jim Paulsen of Leuthold Group noted this past week:

“Wow finally the anecdotal evidence that inflation was easing has finally showed up in a mainstream inflation report. The Fed is rapidly losing its case for further tightening and this report reinforces for investors that either a new easing cycle has already begun or we are getting very close to one.”

The market rally over the last couple of weeks was based upon the anticipation of “peak inflation.” Importantly as we touched on last week several bullish indicators suggest the market’s lows may be in. On a weekly basis the shorter-term MACD signals have triggered a buy signal from a very oversold basis. Historically that signal suggests higher prices over the intermediate term.

But an even more bullish chart comes from a monthly perspective. As shown the market decline bounced solidly off of the 3-year moving average. Such is an essential point as it tells us that the current decline was a “correction” and not a “bear market” since the market did not violate bullish price trends. Notably as shown at the bottom the monthly relative strength index (RSI) also bounced off the 50% level which is consistent with previous “corrections.” (RSI tends to correct below 30 during bear markets.)

Lastly there are several non-technical reasons the market likely has some additional strength and could rally further:

There is still a sizeable level of short interest that will need to cover as prices rise. Earnings estimates are getting rapidly cut leading to improved “beat rates” in the Q3 earnings period. Retail investors are jumping back into the markets. Institutions remain offside with too much cash on their books and a need to chase performance. Volatility has declined rapidly as “fear” of a correction fades. Credit spreads continue to fall as money returns to the yield chase.

There are undoubtedly many rationales to the bullish case for equities. With financial conditions easing as stocks rally and credit risks ease there is a bid for equities in the short-term. The technical backdrop also suggests that the lows are in and investors should buy corrections.

However is this time different? That is where the bull or bear market debate finds its argument.

The Bearish Case

As is always the case the bearish argument is grounded more in the macroeconomic monetary and financial fundamentals. While the bulls are ramping up equity risk in hopes of a “Fed pivot” there is little indication from the Fed that such is likely anytime soon. In fact from a historical perspective and even recent comments the Fed’s focus is singular on bringing inflation down to its 2% target. As noted even if CPI prints at 0.2% every month it will take until the end of 2023 for inflation to decline to the Fed’s target.

Furthermore the Federal Reserve is not keen on running a $9 Trillion balance sheet. The Fed needs the Fed Funds rate to be elevated and the balance sheet reduced to engage those policy tools to offset the next recession. Equities are at risk as the Fed’s inflation fight will trigger a recession. We can “review the tape” of the 1970s to see that bear markets and recessions were common when the Fed was hiking rates and combating inflation.

However when it comes to equity risk it is corporate earnings that will drive equity prices. As the Fed hikes rates to slow economic activity and potentially cause a recession such will translate into slower earnings growth and reduced profit margins. Given that valuations are near 30x earnings currently such suggests that stocks will need to reprice lower. The 6-month annual rate of change of the Leading Economic Index (LEI) supports that thesis suggesting earnings will decline over the next two quarters.

Whether the bull or bear market view wins out will only be found out in time. However as noted while the bulls currently control the technical picture the Fed still has control of the macro environment. While we will continue to trade the markets tactically in the short term in our view there is still a risk of a more profound decline unless the Fed changes course in short order.

The short-term market environment is indeed bullish. As such we are looking to increase equity exposure on tests of support that work off some of the overbought conditions. Those supports range from the 100-dma down to the 50-dma keeping the short-term uptrend intact. The 20-dma is set to cross above the 100-dma next week increasing that support level as a potential buying opportunity.

To reiterate from last week the current market environment remains very challenging. We remain highly vigilant to the current climate where the bulls cling from one report to the next in hopes of a reprieve from the Fed. However we suspect such won’t come soon and the risk of disappointment remains elevated. But as always we remain focused on what the market is telling us.

One area we added exposure to this week was Energy. After the recent correction which we discussed was likely back in May the oversold condition a weakening dollar and fundamental backdrop to higher energy prices made a compelling case to add to our energy holdings. Concerning technology we will take advantage of any opportunity where the 50-dma is tested and holds as new support.

Even with our current changes we maintain a substantial cash holding. We will work to lower that cash holding as opportunities present themselves.

Over the last couple of weeks we have repeated the portfolio management rules. With extended markets now is the opportunity to:

Sell losers and laggards.

Trim winners back to portfolio weights

Rebalance allocations

Hold cash for opportunities

Patience remains vital in navigating this market. Try not to let “FOMO” direct your investment strategy.

Daily Commentary Bits

“The Fear & Greed Model based on the inputs published by CNN has entered excessive optimism territory. Over the past 24 years the S&P 500 has returned an annualized -0.3% when the model is above 80%. Signs of pessimism abounded in June and some residual indicators like fund flows still show investors’ repulsion toward stocks. Higher-frequency indicators have rebounded recently pushing our sentiment models to the upper end of neutral or even into excessive optimism territory. This is the point of sink-or-swim. Fly-or-die. Fish-or-cut-bait. All the idioms including more colorful ones my grandpa would have used. During bear markets this is the point where brave buyers take their gains and shorts feel emboldened. During bull markets this is when the latter gets steamrolled. Which one comes out on top over the next 3-4 weeks will tell us a whole lot about prospects through year-end and beyond.” – Sentiment Trader

2008 Redux or New Highs Ahead?

The graph below shows the S&P 500 on a log scale and highlights (red) instances when every S&P 500 sector was simultaneously below their respective 40-week moving averages (WMA). A few weeks ago all sectors were below their 40 WMA which potentially signals the decline is ending. Such was the case in 2015-2016. However as we see the indicator often triggers multiple times during larger bear markets before an actual bottom forms.

As we have written the recent decline and rally look eerily similar to the S&P decline leading to the Bear Stearns failure and the rally that ensued. The 40wma triggered twice at the initial lows of the 2008 bear market but they proved to be false signals. If the economy enters a recession as it did in 2001 and 2008 we fear this may not be the last red dot for this bear market. Is the graph a reason for optimism or concern?

SimpleVisor Top & Bottom Performers By Sector

SimpleVisor S&P 500 Snapshot

Relative Performance Analysis

The market surge pushed EVERY MARKET and SECTOR into extreme overbought territory. As is usually the case this analysis indicates the market has likely extracted the majority of the rally so taking profits remains a profitable strategy. It is also worth noting that many markets and sectors are now well deviated ABOVE their respective 50-dma which suggests a pullback is very likely.

Technical Composite

The technical overbought/sold gauge comprises several price indicators (RSI Williams %R etc.) measured using “weekly” closing price data. Readings above “80” are considered overbought and below “20” are oversold. Markets tend to peak when readings are at 80 or above which suggests profit taking and risk management are prudent. The best buying opportunities are when readings are 20 or below.

The current reading is 72.44 out of a possible 100 and rising. Remain long equities for now.

Portfolio Positioning “Fear / Greed” Gauge

The “Fear/Greed” gauge is how individual and professional investors are “positioning” themselves in the market based on their equity exposure. From a contrarian position the higher the allocation to equities to more likely the market is closer to a correction than not. The gauge uses weekly closing data.

NOTE: The Fear/Greed Index measures risk from 0 to 100. It is a rarity that it reaches levels above 90. The current reading is 59.73 out of a possible 100.

Sector Model Analysis & Risk Ranges

How To Read This Table

The table compares the relative performance of each sector and market to the S&P 500 index.

“M/A XVER” is determined by whether the short-term weekly moving average crosses positively or negatively with the long-term weekly moving average.

The risk range is a function of the month-end closing price and the “beta” of the sector or market. (Ranges reset on the 1st of each month)

The table shows the price deviation above and below the weekly moving averages.

The risk/range table resets at the first of each month Already just two weeks into the month many markets and sectors are trading well above their historical monthly trading ranges. Such usually is not sustainable and the big deviations from the short-term moving averages also argue for a correction. It is worth noting that most markets and sectors still trade with “bearish” crossovers of short- and long-term moving averages.

Aug 11th

“We are rebalancing our energy exposure in the Equity model only by selling Marathon Oil (MRO) and adding to Exxon Mobil and Devon Energy. Energy has gone through a decent correction and turned back on short-term buy signals and with a weakening dollar such should bode well for energy stocks. While we like MRO the consolidation into XOM and DVN boosted our overall dividend yield of the portfolio.”

Equity Model Only

Sell 100% of Marathon Oil (MRO)

Increase XOM to 2% of the portfolio.

Increase DVN to 2% of the portfolio.

Aug 12th

“While we are holding an outsized position in cash in our bond allocation to hedge against interest rate risk we are moving 10% of that allocation to the 1-3 Month Treasury Bill ETF (BIL) for now to earn a better yield than money market and what we currently have allocated to Floating Rate Treasuries (TFLO). This is a temporary parking spot for cash until we begin to add to our longer-duration holdings as a recession becomes more evident.”

Both Equity And ETF Models

Initiate a 10% position into SPDR 1-3 Month Treasury Bills (BIL)

Although it's never great to get stranded abroad at an airport the good news is that there are four convenient lodging options within walking distance of the airport's Terminal 1 from which Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners as well as some other major carriers fly.

Marriott Bonvoy members can choose from either the Frankfurt Airport Marriott or the Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel and Conference Center while those with Hilton Honors accounts might look toward the Hilton Frankfurt Airport or the Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport. All four are solid choices but we wondered how they stacked up against each other.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

To answer that question we spent a night hotel hopping among the four of them. Here's who each of these four hotels will be best for — and what you can expect at each one.

The Marriott match-up

First up our take on Marriott Bonvoy's conjoined hotels just across from the airport's Terminal 1.

Frankfurt Airport Marriott Hotel

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

Best for: Tired travelers willing to spend more for a cushy stay without a long journey between Terminal 1 and a bed.

Location: Frankfurt Airport Terminal 1. Simply take an escalator up from the departures level walk across an enclosed pedestrian bridge and make a right into the shared entrance of the Marriott and the Sheraton then veer off to the left toward the Marriott's lobby. The time from hotel to terminal? A mere two minutes.

The price point: At 170 euros ($173) for a one-night Deluxe King room stay in the first week of June the price was well worth the experience. Award nights through Marriott's Bonvoy loyalty program will cost 31000-41000 points apiece depending on the date.

The vibe: The lobby was beautiful and had a chic and classy vibe compared to the hectic hallways of Frankfurt Airport. The warm neutrals and mixture of suede leather and wood materials presented a comfy — and somewhat sexy — respite from the hustle and bustle of travel. The sitting area looked like the living room of a well-off Manhattanite who had just a little bit too much money to spend on furniture.

The dining area felt fresh and even worthy of an Instagram post thanks to the sophisticated contrast of the green leather seating and the yellow glassware the brass fixtures and the airiness of the skylit space. Just beware the mid-morning rush when large groups of travelers tend to clog the area waiting to check out.

It truly felt like a little haven away from the chaos of travel which we all know too well. Though the hotel shares some common public areas with the Sheraton around the corner it still felt individualistic and approachable and the staff was accommodating enough to enable an early check-in.

The rooms: The decor was straightforward but with little quirks like quotes by Goethe (a Frankfurt native) on the walls and the industrial nature of the design felt like a deliberate allusion to the nearby airport. A decent-size desk was excellent for getting some work done during a layover and the in-room Krups espresso machine with complimentary coffee pods and accompaniments can be a jetlag-busting lifesaver.

The gray-tiled bathroom lay somewhere between institutional and oasis-like with a basin-style sink a backlit vanity and half-glassed-in shower whose steady water pressure made sudsing up with the provided thisworks products a refreshing experience.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 8 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Drinking and dining: The hotel's public amenities many of which are shared with the adjacent Sheraton felt upscale and private providing a nice respite from the crowds circulating throughout the busy airport. The Eatery Kitchen and Bar which connects the Marriott with the Sheraton is open for lunch and dinner and is centered around a bright atrium with plenty of counter and restaurant-style seating to either side of the central bar. At one end there was a Starbucks outlet for caffeine on the go though the restaurant serves food and drinks throughout the day and evening including fresh items like Caesar salad with grilled chicken ($26) pan-fried hake with Dijon sauce ($31) and a Marriott signature burger ($25).

Guests can partake of breakfast at the Sheraton including a copious selection of rolls assorted sausages and a crowd favorite chocolate museli though expect a hefty bill of 32 euros ($33) per person if you don't get free breakfast through elite status.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 9 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Overall: The lobby was chic the service was spot on and the food options were varied and fresh especially after a decent amount of travel and eating on the go. The room decor was more playful than you might expect and though the hotel was more expensive than the Sheraton the upsell is well worth it.

Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel & Conference Center

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

Best for: More budget-minded Bonvoy loyalists looking for a better-priced but just as convenient option as the Marriott.

Location: You can access the hotel from Terminal 1 the same way you get to the Marriott only head right instead of left to get to its lobby.

The price point: We paid 149 euros ($152) for a one-night stay in early June in a standard king room. (Cash rates are now considerably higher though that might be the summer rush.) Points redemptions range from 22000 to 30000 points per night for a standard room in the next few months.

The vibe: Despite a new and attractive lobby this large hotel — it was originally 1008 rooms before the Marriott was carved out of it in 2020 — has guestrooms and hallways that are drab (but certainly functional). The maze of corridors were dimly lit and spartan with the exception of room number signs featuring an airplane motif — an obvious reminder that yes you are staying at an airport hotel.

This hotel shares common areas a fitness center and a restaurant with the Marriott. It's an example of some brand synergy in the Marriott portfolio that was made possible by the company's 2016 acquisition of Starwood — of which Sheraton was a part.

The rooms: Standard rooms live up to that categorization measuring approximately 291 square feet with standard if quickly aging accouterments like king-size beds with blonde wood frames woven fabric headboards and well-worn white linens. Business travelers can get some work done at awkwardly placed (yet well-powered) elliptical wooden desks and stay ahead of jetlag thanks to the provided tea and coffee supplies (no espresso machines here). The wall-mounted televisions have streaming capabilities. Sparse by comparison the almost clinical (and glaringly lit) bathrooms wouldn't look out of place in a hospital ward and have hard-to-navigate shower-tub combos though the (somewhat confusing) mix of Le Grand Bain and Acca Kappa bath products are an overall plus.

Dining and drinking: The Sheraton shares a lobby with the Marriott along with the Eatery. Its signature burger is a sizzling patty placed on a tasty sourdough roll with a bowl of crispy fries. Though tempting the berry tarte flambee ($14) looks more like a berry-topped pizza than the Alsatian delight it's meant to be.

Overall: The Sheraton tends to be priced much lower than the Marriott -- often 100 euros ($101) less per night -- but shares the same location and amenities. If you can forgo a newer fresher room then this hotel is a great value.

The Hilton head-to-head

Next up we checked into Hilton's sibling properties at the Squaire a dramatic spaceship-like office building with a few shops and restaurants that is connected to the airport and its train station via an indoor walkway.

Best for: Hilton Honors members who don't mind spending 10 more minutes walking to the airport along with spending a few extra euros on a slightly elevated hotel experience

Location: The Hilton Frankfurt Airport is located in the architecturally singular Squaire Germany's largest office building which itself is built on top of the Frankfurt Airport's long-distance train station. It's about a 10-minute walk from Terminal 1 and about a five-minute walk past the entrance to the Marriott and Sheraton via the enclosed pedestrian bridge that connects the airport and the train station. There are a few more escalators and turns to navigate but great signage makes it easy to get between the hotel and airport. The building has a mall-like atmosphere with some stores and restaurants. A Burger King and Starbucks are located right outside the hotel entrance with a Rossmann drugstore nearby for purchasing any needed travel essentials.

The price point: Rates in early June were 161 euros ($164) for a one-night stay in a standard queen room. (Cash rates are now considerably higher.) At check-in an upgrade to a standard king room was offered for just 5 euros ($5.09). This hotel participates in the Hilton Honors program with award stays that range from 32000 to 70000 points per night for a standard room in the coming months.

The vibe: The architecturally interesting lobby almost feels like something out of a futuristic science fiction movie. It's also a bit sterile: The airy open space could use a bit more furniture and lacked much seating. The lobby bar was closed during our stay in early June and was only used for a few hours each evening to host the hotel's evening reception for elite Hilton Honors members. Re-opening that bar might work wonders for livening up the lobby.

In contrast to the two Bonvoy properties this hotel never felt particularly crowded despite being located so close to one of Europe's busiest airports. One big downside to the design is that the stunning glass-enclosed lobby isn't air conditioned which creates a greenhouse effect — making it very hot in the late spring afternoon sun.

The rooms: Rooms are bright and large if slightly impersonal with neutral-toned woods and upholstery — though the boldly patterned carpeting and bright red modernistic wingback chairs provide a little character. The large glass desks feel outdated at this point but provided plenty of room to work with a flatscreen TV mounted right above. Bathrooms are spacious and include both a soaking tub with tiled backsplash and a separate walk-in shower stocked with fragrant Crabtree & Evelyn products. Sizable closets well-stocked minibars and easy-to-use hot water kettles with instant coffee complete the business traveler's trifecta of in-room amenities. My exterior-facing room had a view of the autobahn and ironically the Sheraton.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 8 (Photo by Ethan Klapper/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Drinking and dining: The hotel's main eatery is Rise restaurant located near the massive lobby. At the time of our stay Rise had limited hours and offered different buffets throughout the day. The 34 euro ($35) breakfast buffet was both expensive and extensive — a good value for those with Hilton Gold status and above who receive a food and beverage credit as part of their elite perks and a pricey splurge for everyone else. The buffet's vast selection of breakfast breads cold cuts pancakes sausages and yogurts should have options for every appetite. However more budget-conscious travelers might want to skip this indulgence and grab a much less expensive breakfast sandwich at the Burger King or one of the other grab-and-go establishments nearby.

Overall: Aside from its singular setting there's not much to distinguish the Hilton Frankfurt Airport from a Hilton anywhere else in the world. The decor is somewhat bland and the in-room amenities are fine if unremarkable. That said this could be a decent use of points when room rates soar during busy times of year and a bargain at other times.

Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport

Best for: Thrifty travelers who want to earn or burn Hilton points at an affordable rate.

Location: Follow the directions above for Hilton Frankfurt Airport but turn left immediately before entering the lobby of the Hilton.

The price point: The rate for a queen room was 151 euros ($154) with a Hilton Honors discount or 27000-50000 points per night which is not expensive but perhaps not merited by the amenities and accommodations on offer. The general atmosphere felt aloof and the color combinations of bright green accents with red and brown sprinkled throughout come off as both generic and odd. It made the design feel like an afterthought which also made the hotel feel impersonal. This is definitely a pass-through hotel but if you only need it for a quick stay then maybe it's the winner.

The vibe: Small and stark the lobby had a few squared-off sofas for lounging by the no-nonsense check-in desks but did not feel like a place to hang out. The hotel does deserve a plus for glass elevators that whisk you up to guest rooms through the central atrium.

The rooms: Rooms feel slightly smaller and more basic than at the next-door Hilton. The office chairs felt like Staples castoffs while solid wooden desks and bed frames aren't quite offset by the dim accent lighting. The bathrooms are more compact than at the Hilton with shower-tub combinations rather than separate installations (though you can still enjoy the same Crabtree & Evelyn products). Fancy a preflight cup of coffee? You'll find the same instant coffee kettle setup as at the Hilton.

Drinking and dining: The Restaurant is closed at the moment for lunch and dinner (this is described as all-day dining on its website but with its hours listed as 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.). You can visit it for breakfast when it offers an American buffet for 25 euros ($26). There are also paid grab-and-go options from the Pavillion Pantry which offers a selection of snacks and sweet treats. Hilton Garden Inn guests also can venture over to the neighboring Hilton to eat according to a front desk manager.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

Overall: If you just need a quick rest before or between flights and don't care about other amenities the Hilton Garden Inn Frankfut Airport is just fine. However if you're going to spend any time in your room or want a convenient on-site restaurant (without having to venture out into the Squaire) then you'll probably be better off at the Hilton.

Checking out

If you're traveling through Frankfurt Airport you certainly have some solid hotel options in case you get stuck there unexpectedly.

The Frankfurt Airport Marriott has an unbeatable location and is the newest of the hotels; a beautiful spotless property with a thoughtful design.

The Hilton Frankfurt Airport is a farther walk from the terminal but also a winner with nice-enough design and highly functional rooms. Food and beverage options at this property are pricey and limited but many other options abound just outside the front door.

The third full-service property the Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel & Conference Center is co-located with the Marriott and also is very convenient though its dark dated design and sterile bathrooms leave a bit to be desired.

Finally budget-conscious travelers should be satisfied with the Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport which is at a lower price point than its full-service neighbors but does not sacrifice the convenience.

If you end up staying at one of these properties we sure hope you're there willingly and not because an airline meltdown sent you there. But in any case we're glad to report that you shouldn't have a problem enjoying a decent stay at any of them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3JhbXNleXF1YmVpbi8yMDIyLzA4LzEzL3RhbGtpbmctcGlsbG93cy1jaGFtcGFnbmUtc2FiZXJpbmctYW5kLWJvb3p5LWljZS1jcmVhbS1hdC10aGVzZS1oYXBwZW5pbmctaG90ZWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Talking Pillows Champagne Sabering And Boozy Ice Cream At These Happening Hotels,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ramseyqubein/2022/08/13/talking-pillows-champagne-sabering-and-boozy-ice-cream-at-these-happening-hotels/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3JhbXNleXF1YmVpbi8yMDIyLzA4LzEzL3RhbGtpbmctcGlsbG93cy1jaGFtcGFnbmUtc2FiZXJpbmctYW5kLWJvb3p5LWljZS1jcmVhbS1hdC10aGVzZS1oYXBwZW5pbmctaG90ZWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3ByYWN0aWNhbC1wb2ludGVycy1ob3RlbC1hcHAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This tactic often helps me get an early check-in at hotels,"There are lots of ways to get a late checkout at a hotel and plenty of reasons to want one. The ability to sleep in and milk the final hours of a stay or just pass time comfortably before your flight home can really simplify logistics on the final day of your vacation.

Seasoned travelers know all sorts of tricks to help them score extra time in the room before leaving including the fact that Marriott Bonvoy Hilton Honors World of Hyatt and other major hotel loyalty programs include late checkouts as a benefit you earn with elite status.

But what about checking in early?

This can be equally important for some travelers particularly those who arrive at their destination early in the morning. I found myself looking for early check-in just last week when I arrived in London in the morning from an overnight flight.

Some hotel loyalty programs give travelers check-in flexibility as they reach high-level status tiers. For instance IHG One Rewards makes it an explicit benefit for Platinum Elite and Diamond Elite guests (subject to availability). Marriott Bonvoy Ambassador Elite members can take advantage of the ""Your24"" benefit which allows you to pick your check-in and checkout time.

World of Hyatt has a fairly robust system for reserving an early check-in or late checkout at Hyatt Place hotels. Depending on your status it may cost you but it's a pretty good bargain. Members without elite status or with Discoverist status can reserve a 9:00 a.m. check-in for $10. It's a free benefit for Explorist and Globalist members.

Regardless of the hotel brand there are tricks that might get you into your room early. In some cases at no cost. Will each tactic work every time? No. But it's worth a shot.

A few years ago I remember arriving at about 7:30 a.m. at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) with a lot of time to kill wishing I could just get into my hotel room early.

I had a reservation at the Marriott Tysons Corner — not a top-tier Marriott Bonvoy property by any stretch but not a budget brand either. Fortunately I had checked in on the app the day before.

I was in my room at Tysons Corner at about 9:00 a.m. (Photo by Sean Cudahy/The Points Guy)

A second later my phone buzzed. My room was ready. It was about 8:00 a.m. and my room for that night was ready for me. It felt like a lucky draw but I've had similar scenarios play out several times since then including twice in the last month.

I recently got this notification my room was ready — and was able to access my mobile key — before I'd even arrived in town. (Screenshot from marriott.com)

None of this cost me anything extra and for many of these stays I had either no status or just Marriott Bonvoy Silver Elite status. (I'm now Gold Elite thanks to recently adding The Platinum Card® from American Express to my wallet).

On each of these occasions I used the mobile check-in feature on the app to alert the hotel I'd be arriving early the hotel had a room ready at the time I noted I would arrive.

Many hotel chains will give you the option of a mobile check-in 24 to 48 hours ahead of your arrival. The app will generally ask you what time you plan to get to the hotel.

With some apps — including the Marriott Bonvoy app — you have quite a bit of latitude to put the earliest time you might arrive. This doesn't mean the hotel will honor your request but you have nothing to lose by putting the time you actually plan to get there.

Again just this past week while driving to Iowa for the Field of Dreams game I marked ""noon"" for my arrival time hoping to get some early afternoon rest in my room after a morning flight. It worked.

(Screenshot from marriott.com)

Now this obviously isn't a foolproof tactic. I've generally had greater success getting into my room early at less in-demand hotels. Are you as likely to be successful getting into your room hours early at the Ritz Carlton Turks and Caicos or the JW Marriott Cancun Resort & Spa? as I was at a hotel in rural Illinois?

Probably not. It's worth a try though.

Set yourself up for a smooth trip: make the request elsewhere too

If getting into your room early is important to you there are some other steps you can take to try and maximize your chances of getting an early check-in.

For one some hotel chains give you the option to make the request when you actually book the stay. At Marriott if you know when booking your room that you'll want to get into your room early you can click ""early check-in.""

(Screenshot from Marriott Bonvoy)

Then note your anticipated arrival time. Again this isn't guaranteeing anything but it can certainly help give the hotel an early heads-up that you'll be wanting to get into your room early. It's all based on availability Marriott says. The company also has a chat feature in its app where you can go in and make requests after booking the stay.

(Screenshot from Marriott Bonvoy)

Using Hilton as another example there isn't a specific ""early check-in"" box when you're booking a room but there is a place where you can write in a ""special request.""

(Screenshot from Hilton)

If all else fails you can try using the app to chat with the hotel to request an early check-in call the front desk or visit the front desk in-person to see if they have a room ready for you ... or if they can accelerate the process of getting one ready. At the very least the front desk can generally secure your belongings so you're not lugging your bags around while waiting for a room.

Bottom line

Some hotels have protocols for getting an early check-in. At many properties your options grow as you earn elite status.

But regardless of status we all find ourselves with a need to get into a hotel room early from time to time. From checking in on your mobile app and marking your arrival time to making use of live chat and special request features to the timeless strategy of asking nicely there are any number of tactics you can try.

Ultimately it's a question of availability and letting the property know — as early as possible — what you want.

In response to growing security concerns for storing customer credit card information on a magnetic stripe EMV chip-based cards have cemented themselves as the new standard for storing sensitive account information and facilitating consumer transactions. Even before the rise of the magnetic stripe engineers had long foreseen chip-powered cards as the future; only now is a post-magstripe world coming to fruition as credit card companies permanently phase out the dated technology.

After nearly 12 months of adjusting to this coming Mastercard shift and the start of a more focused industry-wide transition how far along are retailers and card issuers?

“This switch from magstripe to fully EMV comes at an interesting time because merchants are already on that road to starting to upgrade everything and that’s really where the challenge would be seen early on” said Cedric Lourie Vice President of Digital Development for leading payment solutions company FreedomPay.

By the time Mastercard’s August 2021 announcement came it was merely the official beginning of the end for the magstripe. The shift had already been underway for some time coming into focus during the EMV liability shift of 2015 where issuers or merchants who didn’t support EMV became saddled with the liability for counterfeit card transactions.

For better or for worse the switch from magstripe to EMV was also accelerated due to pandemic-era pressures which pushed retailers to rethink their tech stacks as they adapted to contactless payments acute omnichannel fulfillment and logistics oversight needs. In turn card issuers and payment solutions providers had to respond to the consumer needs of the moment by scaling existing solutions to meet functionality and sales demand.

These pressures turned into a whole payments ecosystem strategically deploying solutions that kept both short- and long-term payment methods in mind which included considerations around payment systems that could manage the old (magstripes) the rising standard (EMV chips) and the future (tap and biometric payments).

“We’re going to see a sprinkling of both where you have that common ubiquitous-type functionality and EMV because it’s easy to use but you’re also going to see a lot of innovation when it comes to identifying a consumer in a more secure way that’s at a lower risk of fraudulence” Lourie said.

The payments ecosystem at large has already accepted the utility of EMV chip-based cards even if they’re acknowledged to be a slightly slower experience than the magstripe. According to EMVCo as of Q4 2021 EMV chips are used for a little over 90% of face-to-face card transactions globally. The U.S. is behind on this EMV transition and has been since as early as 2015. In the same EMVCo survey the U.S. logged only around 82% of card-present transactions; on the other side of that coin the European region averages its EMV usage at around 98.5% of card-present transactions.

But even though EMVs have already gained mass consumer merchant and solutions-provider acceptance this phase of transition away from the magstripe is bogged down by trying to retain functionality for both edge and legacy audiences.

“You have this payment ecosystem where it’s a combination of emerging technologies and very future facing players but you still have a very large assortment of what we’d consider legacy platforms out there that weren’t that ready to adopt these types of functionalities as common” Lourie said.

Mastercard’s official transition away from the magstripe couldn’t come at a better time as consumers are becoming more willing to experiment with new payment options. Nearly two-thirds of respondents in Mastercard’s 2021 New Payments Index global survey said they tried a new payment method they would not have tried under normal circumstances. That number shot up to 93% in 2022. Considering EMV chips are already the globally dominant card-based payment method these future-focused numbers only confirm that standardizing the chip and ditching the stripe is a top priority for the payments industry.

One of the most recent pulse checks on credit card technology sentiment a Phoenix Consumer Monitor survey for Mastercard from December 2020 showed only 11% of consumers still preferred swiping their card for checkout. However even as credit card companies standardize EMV technology for an audience that clearly prefers it they must remain conscious of the core functionality that the magstripe has offered for the best part of the last 60 years.

The swipe experience has been a consistently quick one for consumers who increasingly want to spend as little time in the checkout line as possible; for card issuers magstripe cards are cheaper than EMVs and future-facing technologies. These aren’t reason enough to push back against the EMV transition but customer experience and issuing cost should remain front of mind as priorities during this shift away from the magstripe.

This is especially true for the merchant whose customer base is now more attuned to the value of experience-led retail and frictionless checkout. With more options for online ordering convenience brick & mortar retailers are less immune to the consequences of a bad shopping experience as brand loyalty trends downward.

“The easy answer here that isn’t always the most practical is to be on the latest versions the most up to date type of technologies and essentially always being educated on what’s coming out and what’s going to help you create that most optimal consumer experience so you don’t have those experiences where you get those failures because that is the negative consumer experience every merchant tries to avoid” Lourie said.

Protecting against said failures is still a consideration even for EMV cards. As early as 2016 researchers made EMV’s potential backdoors for fraud and technology failure evident often having to do with overconfidence in the payment hardware’s resistance to tampering.

However compared to the Secret Service’s reported $8 billion annual loss from swipe-related card skimming these potential EMV deficiencies have largely won the opportunity cost battle. Studies conducted in the early days of EMV’s adoption already showed the security improvements that came with chip-based payments; between 2015 and 2018 Visa reported an almost 75% decline in credit card fraud due to the adoption of EMV chip cards.

“For [the credit card companies] they want the security because they want to veer as far away from fraudulent transactions as they can” Lourie said.

Transaction safety is still one of the biggest motivators for speeding up the adoption of EMV technology. Magnetic stripe cards are easy and inexpensive to clone their reliance on a signature for identification over a PIN makes them easy to defraud and they have a less sophisticated encryption process. EMV chip cards all-in-all raise the transaction safety floor.

One of the biggest challenges still inhibiting mass transition away from the magstripe is a lack of awareness on how to identify the safest payment solutions and scale deployments for hundreds of payment locations. The answer for merchants lies in developing the right partnerships with solutions providers thought that’s always easier said than done considering the wide array of providers technologies and sales channels to keep in mind. Lourie said this will likely motivate credit card companies to lead the charge on helping merchants establish the right relationships to make this transition as seamless and cost-effective as possible.

“We are going to see a lot more partnerships with others in the payment ecosystem from the card brands in order to really start to fuel that adoption of those cards and get that turnover to get those magstripe cards out of the market” Lourie said.

Brick-and-mortar stores continue to invest in new point of sales systems as part of larger transformations to their physical space. But to avoid having to make consistently large investments down the road in constantly-evolving payment systems it is essential to form partnerships with “a player that sits in the middle and has arms in various parts of technology” said Lourie. Whether that’s a solid grasp of the current EMV consumer standard or of coming biometric-enabled cards the goal is to work with payments partners that act as “either an aggregator or just a facilitator” of an all-in-one solution.

To complete the final leap towards chip-based technology and achieve Mastercard’s projections of complete adaptation by 2033 ironically it is the legacy players like Mastercard who need to be the most proactive in harnessing the connective power of intermediaries to accelerate the adoption process of chip-based tech. In the meantime Lourie advises merchants to consider a holistic approach away from the magstripe and how standardizing EMV payments as well as preparing for future payment solutions impacts their whole business model.

“How do I tie together all these different parts of my business so that I can ensure a consistent consumer experience that there’s security everywhere not just in certain parts of my environment and then how do I tie everything together so that I can really start to drive some interesting functionality down the road” Lourie said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2Npb3NlYS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL3ZpZGVvcy9zcG90bGlnaHQtc2FuZGVlcC1tYWxob3RyYS1ldnAtcHJvZHVjdHMtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1hc2lhLXBhY2lmaWMtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC85MzU1MjA3MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spotlight: Sandeep Malhotra EVP Products & Innovation Asia Pacific Mastercard | ETCIO SEA,"Spotlight: Sandeep Malhotra EVP Products & Innovation Asia Pacific Mastercard

We are always hearing about the ‘latest groundbreaking innovation doing good for the community’ but are these innovations doing good for those in an already advantageous position or are they helping make the financial world more accessible?

Great strides have been made toward financial inclusion yet close to one-third of adults – 1.7 billion – are still unbanked according to The World Bank. Research by The Inclusion Foundation shows that 1.23 million of the UK’s citizens are unbanked.

In the second part of our focus on how to improve access to affordable financial services to all we share more industry insight on the topic. You can read part one here.

Neobanks are the ‘way forward’

Raghunandan G. is co-founder and CEO at Zolve the cross-border neobank. Unsurprisingly he sees neobanks are one of the emerging solutions to help the unbanked become banked as they can ‘help consumers address their individual financial needs better and plan for improved spending habits going forward’.

He says: “Neobanks have grown in popularity in recent years because of technological advances and offering flexibility that is not found with traditional banks. They are also in line with what consumers have come to expect thanks to advances in places such as restaurants and retail outlets where technology makes the user experience easier.

“Speaking of flexibility traditional banks operate at normal business hours. This means easy access to the banks becomes limited to ‘banking hours’. In addition these institutions pose geographical challenges to their customers. People must come to branches and sometimes make multiple visits to complete tasks.

“On the other hand neobanks are really built around customers’ needs. They take a customer-centric approach to developing technologies solutions and tools that provide customisation from a laptop or phone.

“Customers no longer need to visit brick-and-mortar bank branches to complete tasks. Instead they find greater financial freedom that better fits with their lifestyle and schedules. They can take charge of their finances and use simple tools to plan for everyday expenses and big purchases in the future.”‘

Focus on identity

One of the main reasons why people are unbanked is due to an inability to formally prove their identity says Gus Tomlinson identity and fraud product director EMEA at GBG a provider of digital identity and fraud solutions.

“Today digital identity isn’t equal for everyone” she says. “Credit history and physical documents like passports and driving licences are currently used to verify an individual. But in the UK many people don’t have these documents – more than 11 million Brits do not have a passport for example. And this leads to people often the most vulnerable people in society being excluded.

“As we begin to rely more on online services it is fundamental that digital identity is made equal and accessible for all. To do that the government needs to open up access to the data it holds – school records National Insurance Number medical records – so that we can more easily identify everybody in society. In addition regulators need to work to adapt the requirements for identity based on the advancements in technology that allow companies to take a risk-based approach to identity online.”

Understand digital barriers

Much of the conversation has focused on how best to widen access to existing financial products or on how to improve products and services to appeal to underserved communities. While focusing on these factors have been beneficial we must also focus on the barriers preventing people from becoming banked in the first place suggests Nabeel Irshad VP government & public sector fintech ESG UK & Ireland Mastercard UK and Ireland.

“These barriers consist of a lack of digital skills and confidence many have in going online. In fact according to the Lloyds Bank 2021 UK Consumer Digital Index there are two million households that struggle to afford internet access in the UK today and resultingly 10 million adults lack the most basic digital skills.

“Widening the debate to discuss these ‘digital barriers’ alongside financial inclusion is crucial if we are serious about ensuring the unbanked become banked.

“It’s no good if banks and fintechs have the most beautifully designed intuitive websites and app user journeys if people cannot access the internet in the first place or have never learnt how to browse the web. It’s like having a high street with great shops and products that only those with advanced map reading skills can find.

“Education is key. So banks and other providers must improve the digital skills of those who lack them by providing better more inclusive access to information on financial services. The banking world must also offer consumers practical tools to improve accessibility for those who are unbanked. Failing to address this as an industry risks us failing to tackle an underlying cause of exclusion.”

Open banking can help the unbanked

The unbanked refers to individuals that do not have access to traditional bank services or do not have an account at a bank while the underbanked pertains to people who do have an account but prefer to use alternative financial services argues Rolands Mesters CEO and co-founder of Nordigen the open banking API.

“Open banking can have a profound impact on allowing unbanked and underbanked individuals to access financial services and bringing financial inclusion to these underrepresented groups” he says. “One way in which open banking can help the unbanked is by creating alternative solutions that can be more easily accessed than traditional financial services through digital means and technology.

“Traditional banking and loan firms frequently only offer lending products to people with established credit histories which they source from credit bureaus. Not only is this data often out of date it also relies on the consumer having an extensive record for utilising traditional financial services and products such as credit cards. This isn’t feasible for the unbanked.

“Open banking on the other hand enables customers to become eligible through alternative financial data such as through timely utility bill repayments. Not only does this enable more consumers to benefit from financial services but it also allows financial firms to maintain more variety in their product offerings with varying solutions tailored to the specific needs of their clients.

“Open banking also gives users more power over their personal finances as consumers are able to use tools such as personal finance management applications that are powered by data and AI algorithms to give users a better understanding of their financial status as well as solutions to assist them with making better decisions.”

There needs to be more understanding

Lisa Fischer chief growth & lending officer at fintech Mission Lane thinks low-income Americans are often blamed for their financial problems and the underbanked has been historically avoided by most financial institutions.

She say: “At Mission Lane we’ve built our business around having empathy for low-income consumers and recognising who they really are – conscientious people who typically live within their means but may have hit a bump in the road.

“For example maybe a customer wants to pay their bills but their computer broke so they are unable to pay them online. Companies can engage with customers to see what’s wrong and work with them to fix it – a win-win for all. Mission Lane is a fintech that looks beyond the stereotypes to meet customers’ individual financial needs.

“We believe that people shouldn’t be defined by their mistakes. Rather they should be empowered with tools products and guidance that can help them get on a better path and achieve their financial goals – without the hidden fees and confusing terms that many customers in this segment are forced to deal with.

“It’s also more than just about getting access — many people in this population do have access to mainstream financial services yet the service and products they are offered are not high quality not engineered for their specific needs and can be incredibly costly. These consumers face hidden fees minimum deposit requirements and other expenses making it difficult to afford basic financial services including the ability to open a bank account.”

Mistrust of financial systems

Also addressing access in the US is Nick Elders CEO of SPARK a cloud-based loan origination company specialising in helping banks and credit unions support the small business ecosystem. He suggests some unbanked and underbanked don’t even begin to engage with banking institutions because of the lack of trust in the systems that have been established over years and years of abuse.

He comments: “Woven throughout America’s long and difficult history with race is also a story about unequal access to capital and resources located within the banking sector.

“Fintechs play a crucial role in correcting these disparities and the technology can help banks create deeper connections for community outreach and engagement; take human bias out of lending by utilising automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to create simplified ways to assess creditworthiness; and provide opportunities for increased economic development in underserved areas.

“By continuing to ignore underserved markets the lending industry is missing out on the opportunity to build a more inclusive accessible and thriving economy. When institutions like mission-driven lenders have the right fintech partners they will not only drive more engagement with underserved communities but increase mainstream participation in these markets.”

Not everyone wants a bank

While financial status is the main reason people choose to remain unbanked it’s not the only one says Chirag Patel CEO digital wallets at payments firm Paysafe.

“Over the last decade governments and other international organisations have been making their best efforts yet to boost financial inclusion. While the numbers may indicate that these initiatives may have slightly improved the situation they have one critical flaw. They all assume that the answer to solving financial exclusion is simply enabling access to a traditional bank account.

“Reasons for being underbanked or unbanked vary from not having enough money to meet minimum requirements high maintenance fees and the risk of overdrafts – but also many simply choose not to be banked for various reasons.

“According to a Financial Conduct Authority report a third of the U.K.’s 1.3 million unbanked used to have a bank account but don’t want to have one again. Likewise 56.2 per cent of unbanked Americans say they aren’t interested in being banked either. So while there are many initiatives to improve access to bank accounts and digital financial services those are not the only approach to tackling better financial inclusion.

“Traditional banks and fintechs are no longer the only entities that can deliver financial services. With banking as a service (BaaS) there is an opportunity to enable the unbanked and underbanked to start engaging with the financial system on their terms. BaaS’s potential lies in the fact that it makes it possible for any company to offer financial products tailored to its customers’ needs without having to become a bank.”

Digital assets and DeFi can empower the unbanked

Digital assets are mischaracterised as nothing more than speculative investments or digital playthings for so-called ‘tech bros’ and other privileged groups but the reality could not be further from the truth” says Alex Tapscott managing director of Ninepoint Partners’ Digital Asset Group.

He points to a recent survey conducted by Morning Star in the US that revealed that while 10 per cent of the fully banked owned digital assets a staggering 37 per cent of the underbanked owned them. They’re using digital assets to make payments store value invest in emerging technologies and access an array of other DeFi services to fill the gap.

Moreover 44 per cent of digital asset holders in the US are minorities according to a survey by the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center.

“Outside the United States the situation is starker” he says. “Not only are many people in the global south unbanked or underbanked but their local currencies are often hyperinflationary and they suffer under their governments’ draconian capital controls. Consider Nigeria where nearly 30 per cent of Nigerians use Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat cash.

“In El Salvador there are more Bitcoin wallets than bank accounts. The digital asset wallet MetaMask through which individuals buy sell and store cryptocurrencies digital art like NFTs and more is most popular in the Philippines and Vietnam.

“To be sure we face risk as well as opportunity here. Holding most of our wealth in non-stablecoin digital assets like Bitcoin subjects us to bouts of volatility. 2022 has kicked off with a bout of market volatility felt across many asset classes. Digital assets have not been immune to this tantrum. Rising interest rates and hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve combined with continued uncertainty around Omicron have led to a widespread ‘risk off trade.’

“But ultimately this is a positive thing: In the same way cell phones allowed billions of people to leapfrog landlines digital assets and DeFi are empowering many with financial tools that they could not otherwise access. This is a huge catalyst for economic growth as more people move from the informal cash-based economy to the digital economy of the future. It’s also just plainly a good thing for the world’s unbanked underbanked and disenfranchised and should be encouraged and celebrated.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5aG9kbC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9jb2luYmFzZS1oaWdobGlnaHRzLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1uZXR3b3Jrcy1wb3RlbnRpYWwtZGlzcnVwdGlvbi1vZi10aGUtMTUwMDAwMDAwMDAwLXBheW1lbnRzLWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBhwFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5aG9kbC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9jb2luYmFzZS1oaWdobGlnaHRzLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1uZXR3b3Jrcy1wb3RlbnRpYWwtZGlzcnVwdGlvbi1vZi10aGUtMTUwMDAwMDAwMDAwLXBheW1lbnRzLWluZHVzdHJ5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coinbase Highlights Lightning Network’s Potential Disruption of the $150000000000 Payments Industry,"Crypto exchange Coinbase says that the Lightning Network has the potential to disrupt the massive $150 billion payments industry.

Lightning Network is a layer-2 scaling solution built on top of Bitcoin that aims to enable instant and cost-effective transactions for BTC.

In a new blog post Coinbase says the Lightning Network is targeting a more real-world use case compared to much of the speculative-driven growth on smart contract platforms.

With Visa and Mastercard pulling in around $24 billion in 2021 by collecting 2-3% of every transaction completed with their cards Coinbase says the Lightning Network could be the innovation that undercuts the world’s largest payment processors.

“Humble beginnings aside the potential to turn crypto’s most valuable asset into a true medium of exchange has the power to bring greater financial inclusion to anyone with a smartphone. The ability to cost-effectively route fiat transactions over Lightning rails without users ever knowing they’re using Bitcoin can disrupt $150B+* a year industries.

What Visa/Mastercard is for fiat currencies Lightning can be for Bitcoin. The combination of a universally accessible payment network atop the world’s first open-source protocol for money can help Bitcoin evolve into a true global reserve currency.”

While Lightning has much potential Coinbase notes that adoption is still slow. In addition Lightning has to overcome the massive network effects of Visa and Mastercard.

“Lightning is still cumbersome for new users and merchants. Additionally onboarding low-income users in developing countries remains a major challenge to fulfilling the promise of Lightning remittances.

Lastly the lack of compliance and regulatory frameworks limit the ability for existing payment and banking service providers to onboard and serve a global customer base.”

Coinbase says that should Lightning Network become meaningfully adopted we can expect developing countries with high inflation and “more smartphones than bank accounts” to lead the way.

Now its product is keeping the entire Russian financial system afloat and it shows no signs of leaving the aggressor country’s market

After Russia invaded Ukraine the largest payment systems Visa and Mastercard left the market of the aggressor country dealing a severe blow to the economy. As a result the Russian financial sector was severely damaged and many Russians’ credit cards became worthless plastic forcing many Russians to rush to the ATMs before the final days of VISA and Mastercard ceased operations.

However the banking system did not collapse in part thanks to the Belgian corporation OpenWay. Its Way4 platform — a digital banking solution for managing all types of payment services — continued operating in Russia after the occupation of Crimea and still continues today despite Russia’s full-blown invasion of Ukraine.

Apart from selling the St. Petersburg OpenWay Service LLC to its Russian workers Gitelson and Taratynova the company did nothing after Russia’s full-blown invasion on 24 February 2022.

Collaboration since the occupation of Crimea

Russia has been a partner of OpenWay for many years. After the occupation of Crimea in 2014 the first bank — RNKB — entered the peninsula. Wholly owned by the Russian Federation it of course is under sanctions. In order to avoid the risk of dealing directly with the bank OpenWay established an “intermediary” — LLC “OV Integratsiya.”



In 2017 it was entrusted with the conclusion of 12 contracts with the RNKB. Both LLC “OV Integratsiya” and LLC “Openway Service” (whose owner is a Maltese company that is part of the OpenWay Group) are united by the joint general director Anton Korytov and joint minority shareholders Anna Taratinova and Grigoriy Gitelson. Both companies are located at the same address.

Loophole: Mir payment system

Following the 2014 occupation of Crimea when Visa and Mastercard stopped servicing cards issued by Russian banks operating on Crimean territory a new system for processing bank card payments the National System of Payment Cards was established in Russia.

The National System of Payment Cards (NSPC) is based on the Mir payment system a Russian concoction established by OpeWay which was tasked by the Russian Federation to produce something akin to Visa and Mastercard.

OpenWay was the primary arhitect of Mir upon which the entire payment system of the Russian Federation is built.

This new architecture was created to evade any constraints Western powers could try to impose on the financial system in the future.

Since 2015 the majority of domestic transactions in Russia are processed by Mir while Visa and Mastercard handle international transactions.

Critics say that Russia will invest in alternative schemes in reaction to economic constraints speeding up the adoption of Mir’s cards by Russian banks which are currently accepted in Vietnam Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and will soon be accepted in Russia.

Moreover in the beginning of August 2022 Erdogan said that five Turkish banks will begin adopting the Mir banking system. Erdogan cited the move as a “relief for both Russian tourists and Türkiye” demonstrating this scheme’s steadfastness and importance to the Russian banking system even after sanctions from the West.

Putting money over morales

Evidence of OpenWay’s support for Russia and its preference to put money over morales could be seen when in 2016 by Sergey Bochkarev NSPK JSC’s Deputy General Director said

“A decision was made to create a fundamentally new architecture. The OpenWay company was able to provide a single architectural approach that worked for us and so it became a partner of NSPC.”

The OpenWay software solution now serves as the foundation for the Russian Federation’s entire payment system. If the company left the market of the aggressor state after the start of Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine the payment system of the Russian Federation would have been paralyzed but this did not happen.

According to the Wall Street Journal the departure of Visa and Mastercard means that Russians can’t use their cards outside of the country in many cases and Mir cards are only accepted in a few nations the bulk of which are former Soviet states. However the domestic-payments system continued to work undisturbed even if those cards carry Visa or Mastercard logos.

Many large Russian banks including sanctioned ones continue to use the Way4 platform from OpenWay. This product is used by Sberbank of Russia Alfa Bank VTB Bank VEB Bank and RNKB. Until recently OpenWay boasted of cooperation with “Sberbank of Russia” in all its cases.

The whole Russian financial system is built on OpenWay’s Way4 software package. The corporation realizes this yet continues to operate in the market of the aggressor state.

Particularly it is thanks to this system that the Russian occupiers killing the Ukrainian Army and civilians receive their paychecks on time.

Evidence that the central office is aware of its product being used by Russian banks

There have been no major bank collapses in the Russian Federation because these institutions continue to use the Way4 technology system. This means that the licenses are still valid and being updated.

The crippling effect of Western sanctions on the Russian banking system may have been mitigated in part because in 2017 Moscow passed legislation requiring banks that handle pension payments and public-sector employee wages to make those funds available via Mir cards causing usage to rise from 2 million to 95 million between 2016 and 2020.

It is implausible that the central office doesn’t know Russian’s main banks are using its system. No Russian firms can supply the Way4 platform without OpenWay’s knowledge. This is a software product that requires updating and purchasing licenses. This is possible only with the permission and participation of OpenWay because the platform belongs to the whole group.

Furthermore OpenWay’s Russian contractors are still looking for Way4-trained personnel confirming the company’s desire to continue operations as well as its market success by expanding its workforce.

Particularly one of OpenWay’s many daughter firms LLC “OV Service” owned by the named Gitelson Tarantinova and LLC “OpenWay Service” is openly recruiting and has three vacancies up.

The addresses and contacts of the offices in Russia are now hidden on the OpenWay website but in 2020 they were still online as a snapshot in the Web Archive reveals.

The corporation leverages shell companies managed by local OpenWay employees to communicate with its sub-sanctioned clients. These intermediaries continue to provide OpenWay-owned software.

In 2016 OpenWay avoided international sanctions by selling OpenWay software to Russia’s RNKB through such shell companies.

For this OpenWay Group the parent business deleted its own senior executives from the list of shareholders and renamed the Russian “OpenWay Service” to the abovementioned “OV Service.”

However none of this implies that OpenWay has halted operations in the Russian Federation

It would be naive to believe that OpenWay’s senior executives in Brussels are unaware that the Russian banks are continuing to operate with no disruption to operations; moreover given the Russian surnames and backgrounds of management in the head office (previously studying and living in Russia) it appears unlikely they have no inside contact with the officials in the Russian office.

OpenWay isn’t the only company serving Russia

OpenWay isn’t the only company breaking sanctions and assisting Russia’s war machine in funding its deadly projects in Ukraine and other occupied nations across the world.

It uses the systems of the American software company Oracle in its solutions making it also a collaborator in the Russian banking system as it facilitates the databases used by sanctioned institutions.

Officially the OpenWay Group has operations in Belgium and Cyprus. According to the media the OpenWay Group also includes the Maltese company OpenWay Holdings Limited which previously operated the official OpenWay representative office in Russia.

""With just the limited information that you have about someone... like their first name maybe their phone number age or their Zodiac sign you put this limited information into the system"" Garbo Founder and CEO Kathryn Kosmides told Yahoo Finance. ""In less than two minutes we'll show someone if they have any violence or harmful arrest convictions or sex offender records.""

Garbo searches typically cost $3.25 each according to the nonprofit's website but the web-based app is providing complimentary background checks to Match Group's free and premium subscribers.

First tested on Tinder the offer has now expanded to Match.com and Stir the recently-launched dating service for single parents. Match Group's wide umbrella of apps also includes Hinge and OkCupid which do not currently offer Garbo features on their platforms.

Privacy in online dating

In developing the app Kosmides and her team sought to create ""new kind of online background check"" that limits the exposure of search subjects while still promoting safety in online dating.

""We're trying to balance privacy and protection — the great debate of the digital age"" Kosmides said.

She outlined how the personal data not shown in search results is just as important as what is shown as typical background check platforms tend to reveal too much private information about people.

""I think that background checks have existed in some sort especially since the rise of the internet"" Kosmides said. ""I just don't think that they were a good solution for dating apps. ... They often will provide really invasive access to personal identifying information like someone's home address email address or phone numbers and that can be really dangerous especially if that person is in a vulnerable situation. So we don't provide access to any of that.""

Instead Garbo focuses on flagging subjects for dating violence convictions registries on sexual offense databases and fraud offenses.

The app also looks back only so far depending on the report. Kosmides explained that this gives people a chance to reform themselves.

""We have developed alongside a group of internal and external advocates and experts our personal offense reporting policy which determines what we show and what we don't show on the platform"" Kosmides said.

Background checks and gun violence

It was Kosmides' own experience that led her to create the tech nonprofit.

""I found the company in 2018 really after my own experiences within the justice systems and as a multi-time survivor of gender-based violence"" Kosmides said. ""And since then we've really taken an MVP approach to building and thinking through these really hard-to-solve problems.""

Story continues

Garbo's other partnerships extend to the roommate-finding app Roomi and the National Domestic Violence Hotline where ""within Garbo actually you can talk to an advocate directly without ever having to leave the platform.""

Kosmides added that the app is ""also providing free search credits in those partnerships as well.""

While dating app users are swiping to make up for time lost in the pandemic many are doing so with caution. For instance a Hinge study found that a majority of younger singles in particular prefer alcohol-free dates. Others are staying vigilant against romance scams.

The prevalence of gun violence in the United States also has reason to put digital daters on high alert.

In an op-ed for Fortune Kosmides explained the link between domestic violence and gun fatalities writing: ""In more than half of the mass shootings over the past decade the perpetrator shot a current or former intimate partner or family member as part of his rampage.""

She also told Yahoo Finance that background checks for gun owners — which are completed through the federal government's NICS infrastructure — can have cracks that allow sexual and domestic violence charges to go unnoticed.

As a result many domestic abuse offenders escape charges through the ""boyfriend loophole.""

These background checks ""only look at for example domestic violence convictions but not arrest"" Kosmides explained. ""They don't really look at older orders of protection. There's a lot of carve-outs to kind of allow bad actors or people who have shown that they have bad behavior especially as it relates to gender-based violence.""

FIRST GAME SUMMARY:

The USA’s convincing 3-0 win over Ghana marked the USA’s fifth win in an opening match of a FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup. The USA had failed to win its opening match in its last three U-20 Women’s World Cup appearances with two losses and draw. The only other time the USA failed to win its opening match of a U-20 World Cup was a 1-1 draw with Ghana in 2010. This time around the USA out-shot Ghana 21-5 and did not allow a shot on goal. The USA scored at opportune times getting an 11th minute goal from team captain Michelle Cooper a 38th minute score from Alyssa Thompson after Ghana’s Jacqueline Owusu had received a red card for stomping on the Achilles tendon of midfielder Korbin Albert and then again just six minutes into the second half via Ally Sentnor to effectively put the game away. The USA will rue not finding the net a few more times after playing with a player advantage for almost an hour. Ghana went hard into every tackle and received four yellow cards in addition to the red.

ROSTER CHANGE – BRONCO FOR BRONCO:

Midfielder Sally Menti was ruled out of the 2022 FIFA Women’s World Cup after suffering an ACL tear in her right knee during training in Costa Rica prior to the tournament. She has been replaced by midfielder Annie Karich a rising freshman at Santa Clara the college Menti also attends. The 5-foot-9 Karich (pronounced Care-ick) hails from Surfside California and has one cap at the U-20 level although she also has experience with the U.S. U-15 and U-17 Women’s Youth National Teams. She arrived in Costa Rica on Aug. 13. “We’re absolutely gutted for Sally” said U.S. U-20 WYNT head coach Tracey Kevins. “She’s a fantastic person and player she has a great support system from her family the National Team and at Santa Clara so we know she’ll come back strong. Our players are a very tight-knit group and I know they will keep her in their hearts during this tournament but at the same time we’re looking forward to welcoming Annie back into our team.”

ROSTER NOTES

The USA roster is composed of 18 players currently in college or enrolling this fall one youth club player and two professional players the most professionals ever for a U.S. team at a FIFA youth Women’s World Cup.

Players born on or after Jan. 1 2002 are age-eligible for the World Cup and the USA roster features eight players born in 2002 eight born in 2003 four born in 2004 and one in 2005. Sixteen of the 20 players who helped the USA roll to a 7-0-0 record and 49-0 goal differential at the Concacaf Women’s U-20 Championship made the World Cup roster. The USA’s two professional players -- Jaedyn Shaw of San Diego Wave FC and Olivia Moultrie of Portland Thorns FC – are trailblazers.

Shaw entered the NWSL via the Discovery Process and signed her first professional contract with the Wave on July 18 after training for six months with the Washington Spirit. Moultrie signed with the Thorns in June of 2021 to become the youngest player ever to join the National Women’s Soccer League.

The incoming college freshman on the roster are goalkeeper Neeku Purcell (UCLA) midfielder Carina Lageyre (Duke) Annie Karich (Santa Clara) and goalkeeper Teagan Wy (California).

The rising sophomores are goalkeeper Mia Justus (Florida State) defender Ayo Oke (California) Emily Mason (Rutgers) Lilly Reale (UCLA) midfielder Korbin Albert (Notre Dame) and forwards Andrea Kitahata (Stanford) Michelle Cooper (Duke) Simone Jackson (USC) Trinity Byars (Texas) and Ally Sentnor (UNC) although Sentnor did redshirt freshman season due to injury.

The rising juniors are defenders Laney Rouse (Virginia) Lauren Flynn (Florida State) and Samar Guidry (Virginia) plus midfielder Talia DellaPeruta (UNC).

Every player on the roster has been capped at the U-20 level led by DellaPeruta (19 caps) and defender Emily Mason (15 caps) the two players on the roster who participated in the previous U-20 WYNT cycle.

The five players born in 2004 and 2005 – forwards Thompson Shaw and Sentnor midfielder Moultrie and goalkeeper Wy -- are age-eligible for the 2024 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup.

The USA has played the second-most games (48) in the FIFA U-19/U-20 Women’s World Cup behind only Germany (49) and has scored the second-most goals (104) also behind Germany (127).

Five players who did not make the World Cup qualifying roster persevered to make the World Cup Team. Those players are forward Jaedyn Shaw midfielders Carina Lageyre and Korbin Albert forward Ally Sentnor and goalkeeper Teagan Wy.

The roster is made up of players from 12 different colleges and 13 different states. There are four players on the roster from California three from Texas and two from Georgia Washington and Massachusetts.

UCLA UNC Florida State Duke Virginia and California each have two players on the World Cup roster. The only player on the roster who is not in college or will be this fall is forward Alyssa Thompson who plays for the U-17 boys’ team in MLS Next at Total Futbol Academy in Los Angeles and is headed to Stanford in the fall of 2023.

16 TEAMS VIE FOR 10TH U-20 TITLE:

This year marks the 10th edition of the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup FIFA’s most high-profile women’s competition after the World Cup and the Olympic Games. The biennial competition began as the FIFA U-19 Women’s World Championship in 2002 and was held as a U-19 event in 2004 before moving to its current Under-20 format in 2006. The 16 nations were drawn into four groups of four teams. The top two finishers in each group advances to the quarterfinals to be held on Saturday Aug. 20 and Sunday Aug. 21. The winners of those matches move on to the semifinals on Thursday Aug. 25. The Championship and Third-Place match will be played on Sunday Aug 28. The USA is one of four teams to have qualified for every FIFA WWC at this age level along with three-time champions Germany Brazil and Nigeria.

THE VENUES:

All matches of the World Cup are being played at two venues which are only about 12 miles apart: Estadio Nacional in San Jose (capacity 34024 for the tournament) and Estadio Morera Soto in Alajuela (downsized to 4980 for the U-20 WWC) which is named after a famous Costa Rican player who played for Barcelona in the 1930s. The stadium was named in 1966 in honor Soto whose heart was buried in one of the stadium’s columns. Currently all the energy used by the stadium is 100% solar which makes it one of the few stadiums in all Central America Mexico and the Caribbean to be completely supplied with renewable energy.

USA U-20 WYNT vs. NETHERLANDS:

This will be the first meeting between the USA and Netherlands in the U-20 Women’s World Cup but game day will mark just 47 days since the teams played during a tournament in France. The result was a 2-2 draw with U.S. goals from Michelle Cooper and Jaedyn Shaw while Danique Noordman and Ziva Henry scored for the Dutch. The match featured a penalty kick shootout which the USA won to secure the title at the Sud Ladies Cup.

Ten of the 15 players who played for the USA in that match are on the World Cup Team while the Dutch used 15 players in that match all of whom are all the World Cup Team.

Due to the global pandemic that impacted European qualifying for this tournament teams were nominated by UEFA based on results from the 2019 UEFA Women’s Under-19 Championship. The Netherlands made the semifinals of that tournament which would eventually earn them a U-20 World Cup bid but fell to Germany 3-1 in that semifinal.

All 21 of the Netherlands players plays domestically and they come from nine different clubs several of them famous for the men’s teams including Ajax PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord.

The Dutch had a bit of a sputtering start to this World Cup as they were out-shot by a very talented Japan team 27-8 but defender well and only allowed a 23rd minute goal from Yuzuki Hamamoto.

Goalkeeper Lisan Alkemade who also faced the USA at the Sud Ladies Cup made six saves.

Hundreds attended a Minor League Cricket match between the Silicon Valley Strikers as they played the Hollywood Master Blasters at Wilson High School in Santa Clara.

The Strikers won the championship in 2021 the inaugural year of MiLC.

Sunil Parekh from Mountain View along with his two sons — Sukhman 8 and Jordhveer 5 — were attending their first cricket match. Sunil an avid National Football League Fan said of cricket “It’s a very diverse sport I don’t just see people from the Indian-American community here I see lot of communities here.”

The Strikers formed in 2020 as part of 24 original teams to compete in Minor League Cricket.

“It’s fun for me to see them (his children) watching players that look like them playing professional sports that was the draw” Parekh said adding he’s “really proud of the community for supporting it.”

Strikers won the match 136-132.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjIvMDgvMTQvY29tcGFuaWVzLXN0YXktcnVzc2lhLXJpc2stbmF0aW9uYWxpemF0aW9uLWV4cGVydHMtc2F5LXB1dGluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,47 of the world's biggest 200 companies still haven't left Russia. Now the Kremlin is preparing 'expropriation blackmail ...,"In the six months since Russia invaded Ukraine around 300 global companies have exited the Russian market and another 700 have halted new investments and projects or curbed operations in the country.

Western firms from the U.S. and Europe dominate the long list which includes banks Citi and Goldman Sachs apparel brands like Burberry and Adidas and technology giants like IBM Intel Snap and Twitter according to research from the Yale School of Management.

The large-scale corporate exodus alongside tough western sanctions has devastated the Russian economy—reversing decades of foreign investment and cooperation—despite the Kremlin’s continued petrodollar inflow and its insistence that Russia is faring just fine.

But not all global companies have retreated from the country. Around 47 of the world’s 200 biggest companies are still doing business in or with Russia. The process of leaving after all can come with major costs. Now after concerning new moves from the Kremlin experts say the companies that stayed are now at heightened risk of nationalization as Russia wrestles with how to best deal with the mass corporate exodus and seeks greater control of their economy.

Unclean break

Political and reputational pressure pushed companies to exit Russia in a hurry after the Ukraine invasion.

But making a clean break with the country has proved to be costly and complex and many companies that previously announced their intention to leave have continued to do business there as they evaluate how to get out without losing too much money.

French bank Société Générale became a cautionary tale when it took a $3.2 billion hit selling its stakes in Russian lender Rosbank and affiliated subsidiaries to Russian nickel billionaire Vladimir Potanin (who has since been sanctioned). It sold its Russian assets in a hurry—but to a government-linked businessman as foreign buyers are few given the risks involved. As one senior banking executive told the Financial Times: “We’re all trying to find a clever way to exit the country. But what SocGen did isn’t the best way to do it. There is an ethical discussion… to consider when selling or basically donating to an oligarch.”

But other companies including many from Japan and China are still all in on the Russian market. Resource-poor Japan which has condemned Putin’s war on Ukraine has continued their oil and gas partnerships with the country. “Our policy is not to withdraw” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said earlier this year.

Chinese state-owned railway and telecom companies alongside private tech and heavy industry firms are also still operating as usual in the country—though they remain wary of triggering secondary sanctions from the west. U.S. companies that have stayed include Match Group the owner of Tinder video game developer Riot Games luxury brand Tom Ford among others according to Yale’s research.

But the Kremlin’s recent moves might change those calculations and indicate that the Russian government is willing to take drastic measures against businesses to tighten control of the economy.

‘Expropriation blackmail’

If it was once a difficult decision for companies to stay in Russia or leave it could get a lot easier if Putin decides for them.

On July 1 he signed a decree to allow the government to seize the Sakhalin-2 oil and natural gas project. The Kremlin order gave control of Sakhalin-2 to a new state-created firm that could strip foreign investors of their rights if it wants to one of the most forceful moves by the government in response to the corporate exodus. U.K. energy giant Shell and Japanese trading firms Mitsui and Mitsubishi hold double-digit stakes in the Russian energy project.

This month the two Japanese investors took a $1 billion-plus hit on its Sakhalin-2 assets after writing down the valuation after Putin’s decree. Mitsui and Mitsubishi have stated their desire to remain on the project but are uncertain where their future stands.

The decree demonstrates that Russia is not just willing to expropriate foreign assets but is also positioning itself to engage in “expropriation blackmail” Mark Dixon founder of the Moral Rating Agency a research organization focused on foreign firms in Russia wrote in a July report.

The Sakhalin-2 case shows that foreign investors have already been expropriated and that Russian authorities are giving them the chance to either agree to the new terms of the new entity that now controls the energy project—or lose everything Dixon told Fortune this week.

“We anticipate a tsunami of expropriations or blackmailed concessions over the next couple of months” Dixon wrote earlier this year.

Other experts agree. The Russian government will nationalize—which amounts to expropriation or confiscation by the state—“one foreign company after the other” because of the lack of options available Anders Åslund an economist former senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and author of Russia’s Crony Capitalism told Fortune. Russian assets can’t be sold easily because of the dearth of foreign buyers plus for those companies that have exited the companies can’t leave them without owners he says.

Russia has denied that it will expropriate or nationalize the assets of foreign firms.

“We are not interested in the nationalization of enterprises or their removal” the country’s trade and industry minister Denis Manturov recently said. Additionally a draft law that would allow the government to formally nationalize the assets of international firms that have exited Russia has now been paused. The bill didn’t make it through Russian parliament before the summer recess. But western companies remain under significant pressure to make a clean break with Russia or be subject to the Kremlin’s whims experts say.

The high risk of expropriation remains even though nationalization might be delayed simply because the Kremlin has little alternative Åslund says. Many foreign investors have now left and “the only natural option for the Russian government is either to seize [the companies] or allow them to be seized by Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin for little or nothing—like [lenders] Rosbank and Tinkoff Bank” he says.

The pausing of the draft law on nationalization doesn’t “detract from the long-term direction of the Russian economy—which is towards greater state control and increased Kremlin interventions to mask over structural challenges arising from Russia being cut off from international markets as a pariah country” Steven Tian director of research at the Yale chief Executive Leadership Institute the team responsible for researching the corporate exodus from Russia.

He attributes the pause on legislation to infighting between government officials. Some such as Igor Sechin an oligarch who runs Russia’s oil giant Rosneft are staunchly advocating for nationalistic Russian policies while others are geared toward free market measures. “But clearly the latter faction isn’t winning right now—even if they come out on top on a couple of occasional skirmishes” Tian says.

Approximately 47 of the world’s 200 biggest global firms operating in Russia right now are at high risk of their Russian holdings becoming expropriated or nationalized because of the amount of their investments in the country or current stakes in Russian business according to the Moral Rating Agency report.

European Japanese and Chinese investors in Russian energy projects make up a large chunk of the list which highlights BP’s 19.75% stake in Russian state oil company Rosneft worth $11.2 billion and TotalEnergies’ $13.7 billion Russian energy investments. Western consumer goods firms also made the list including food and beverage company Nestlé which derives 2% of its revenue from Russia and home goods maker Unilever where Russia accounts for nearly 2% of its total sales.

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is a professor of management and senior associate dean for leadership studies who is leading Yale’s research on companies that have left Russia. He told Fortune that Putin’s recent nationalization highlights the Kremlin’s desparation now that Russia has become an “uninvestable nation.” In a recent paper Sonnenfeld’s teams highlights the financial incentives companies have for leaving.

“There is no incentive to remain” he says. The companies stand to lose “operational control staffing control brand control and reputational control.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vYmVzdC13b3JzdC10YWctdGVhbS1wYXJ0bmVycy1qZXJyeS1sYXdsZXItY2FyZWVyLXd3ZS1ud2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Best Tag Team Partners Of Jerry Lawler's Career (& 5 Worst),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vYmVzdC13b3JzdC10YWctdGVhbS1wYXJ0bmVycy1qZXJyeS1sYXdsZXItY2FyZWVyLXd3ZS1ud2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL25mbC1kcmFmdC1uZXdzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zb3V0aC1kYWtvdGEtc3RhdGUtbWF0dC16aW1tZXIvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0MDUxMDAwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Mason McCormick contribute to the Steelers' OL in 2024?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

""The fence usually lasts 48 hours"" said Gord Inglis who operates Inglis Cycle located on McCormick Boulevard behind the property. ""It's very run down neglected not looked after and ignored and it's turned into a playground for children and an area where homeless people [go] in and out.""

A work order was posted on three parts of the fence surrounding some of the property stating that a property inspection done May 8 found contraventions of a city bylaw that requires owners to ensure that vacant buildings are secured against unauthorized entry and to protect the building from the risk of ""fire accident or other danger.""

When a CBC News reporter visited the site on Thursday there were at least eight places where the fence had been torn down partially or completely allowing anyone to walk onto the property.

Windows doors and duct openings were recently covered with plywood Inglis said but that's also usually torn down within days.

Two young teens had to be rescued from the roof of the building on Sunday night London Fire said. There was a fire in the building and the teens who were exploring inside made their way to the roof while they waited for help said Platoon Chief Kirk Loveland. An aerial ladder was used to communicate with the youth and tell them to stay put until firefighters came to the roof to escort them out of the building he said. The teens weren't hurt and were taken away by police.

A similar incident happened on Thursday afternoon. A teen was stuck in the building and police requested the aerial truck again so they could communicate with the young person and escort them out of the building.

Seeing young people in the building is a frequent occurrence Inglis said. ""I feel the city is playing with the devil. Every time an emergency service is called to the building it seems to be more severe. If you don't do something with this building somebody is going to get hurt.""

There are concerns over this former east London factory as redevelopment plans have stalled Duration 0:56 Once a bustling confectionary factory the former McCormick building is now an eyesore that is dangerous for people going in to strip out any metal that can be sold for cash and youth looking for an urban exploring thrill.

'We're picking up garbage everyday'

The recent rescue was just one of the latest incidents where emergency crews were called to the building said Lou Fatibene who owns neighbouring Dundas Automotive.

""I'm surprised nobody's been killed over there yet"" Fatibene said. ""We've had cars broken into the whole area has been vandalized. We're picking up garbage every day.""

Somebody's going to die"" he said. ""How much did it cost us taxpayers to have that aerial truck out there to save the kids?""

Tena Smith who works at Tim's Tires across the street from the old factory says young people are using it as an urban exploration site. Some throw bricks and other items from the roof damaging property and cars below.

""Every Monday when we come in after the weekend it's like the teenagers have had a heyday in there and they've knocked out more windows"" she said. ""We used to park our cars over there to make room for our customers but they throw stuff off the roof. A brick landed on my car and dented my roof so we don't park over there anymore.""

The owners of the property Sierra Construction based in Woodstock did not reply to emails and phone calls asking for comment. They have until May 12 to comply with the city's work order.

The company bought the property for $1. In 2021 McCormick Villages Inc. owned and run by Sierra Construction submitted a plan for a subdivision for the factory site comprising of five hectares. In October 2022 city council approved the development which included repurposing the former factory into a mixed-use mid-rise building as well as townhouses a long-term care facility and a seniors apartment building on the property.

But Sierra Construction wasn't happy with council's decision to limit the apartment building height to five-storeys and to make a multi-use path on the property publicly-accessible among other issues. The Ontario Land Tribunal will consider that appeal in June.

It's been frustrating watching the building and property fall further and further into disrepair said Ward 4 Coun. Susan Stevenson. ""It's becoming a huge safety concern and a lot of people are worried that there will be a tragedy there let alone the disturbance to the neighbourhood that's happening as well"" she said. ""The neighbours just want it taken down.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Antoine Sims 24 entered into a dispute with McDonald’s staff in Kennesaw Georgia that resulted in both him and management calling the police. When officers arrived at the scene they discovered Sims had an outstanding warrant for failure to appear in a homicide case FOX 5 of Atlanta reported.

Sims was previously arrested in March 2019 as he was accused of setting a car on fire with a woman’s body inside in October 2018. He was charged with felony murder and ordered to appear in court.

Friday’s incident started when Sims and his fiancée were waiting for their food at the McDonald’s location when the order seemed to be taking too long Sims explained to Kennesaw police FOX 5 reported.

Sims then approached the cashier to ask about the order which was already waiting on the counter he said. He was not given a receipt so he was unable to know if his order number was called he told police.

""So now our food is sitting there cold"" he explained to the officer per the report. ""So when I come up I try the fries. The fries are lukewarm but they’re not hot.""

Sims then requested a new fries order rather than a refund then feuded with management. Management then demanded he leave the restaurant and both parties called the police FOX 5 reported. The manager later told police Sims cursed them out and threw his order at them.

""I don’t ever want him back here"" the manager told the officer per the report. ""I mean dude’s obviously on probation (out on bond) — got an ankle bracelet on.""

Officers told Sims he was not allowed to re-enter the restaurant and asked him to sign a criminal trespass notice. They also requested dispatch run Sims’ information through crime databases which made him visibly ""agitated"" a police report said.

""I’m afraid of y’all. I just did three years sir. I’m afraid of y’all sir"" Sims told police FOX 5 reported. An officer then approached Sims who sprinted away sparking a chase.

Police later tracked Sims to an apartment complex where a resident said he attempted to break into their third-floor apartment. There the officers used a stun gun and apprehended Sims.

Sims was taken to a hospital and then to jail.

One NSW resident prompted a discussion about Macca's burger sizes by questioning whether the Filet-O-Fish had recently shrunk to a miniature size.

""Have McDonald's Filet-O-Fish always [been] this small? I don't remember it being mini or kid-sized like this?!"" asked the customer on Facebook.

She shared a photo of a Filet-O-Fish sitting between a McChicken burger and what appears to be a Deluxe Quarter Pounder which are both much larger than the fried fish item.

'All the McDonald's burgers have shrunk again'

The woman received a stream of replies from fellow customers who agreed that McDonald's burgers had gotten smaller in recent years.

""All Macca's food is now super-small size"" wrote one customer.

""All the McDonald's burgers have shrunk again – even the Bacon & Eggs McMuffin"" commented a second.

A third added: ""Inflated price... deflated goods.""

Debate over 'shrinkflation' claims

Other customers pointed to the size of the restaurant's iconic Big Mac and Quarter Pounder as evidence of shrinking burger sizes.

""We had Big Macs last week. Not only have the buns shrunk but the meat patties were so thin we could literally see through them. Was as if they had sliced them in half"" wrote one customer.

""Just like the Quarter Pounder got its name as it was a quarter pound of beef it's barely that now"" chimed another.

Some customers however said the Filet-O-Fish is the same as ever.

""It's the same size bun as the Cheeseburger. It's always been small"" commented one person.

A second wrote: ""Been like that for as long as I can remember. Only [with a] steamed bun.""

McDonald's denies changes to burger sizes

A spokesperson for McDonald's told Yahoo News Australia there have been no changes to the size of its burgers.

The spokesperson emphasised McDonald's commitment to quality and great value for its customers.

""We are committed to offering our customers great quality great value burgers featuring 100 per cent RSPCA Approved Chicken and 100 per cent Aussie beef"" said the spokesperson.

The clip which was shared on TikTok but later went viral on Twitter saw the man get down on one knee in Maccie D's in Ealing West London. He came complete with a ring too so he was clearly prepared but his show of commitment didn't go down too well mostly because of his choice of location.

After he got down on his knee and showed her the ring she yelled: """"What are you doing? For five years and you propose in McDonald's? McDonald's? Are you mad?""

However as reported by Joe the proposal was later revealed as a prank although the girlfriend wasn't in on the joke. Perhaps he should have told her because he's probably in the proverbial 'doghouse' now.

The video has since sparked a bit of a debate with some feeling that he did nothing wrong (joke or no joke) with others agreeing with the woman and her reaction.

Most have yet to implement an official remote-only or in-person-only strategy instead easing hesitant workers back into the office with a hybrid policy. But many have been operating in a tale of two cities forcing retail workers back to the frontlines a year before requiring corporate employees to return to the office.

From Walmart to Amazon here’s a breakdown of the top 10 Fortune 500’s return-to-office policies.

1. Walmart

Walmart’s retail workers referred to as in-house associates worked through the pandemic while its corporate workers worked from home for over a year. Walmart released a company memo in October 2021 stating that corporate employees would transition to coming into the office on a “more regular basis” in November.

But Walmart’s 10000 tech employees were excluded from the decision; the company announced in May 2020 that this largely Silicon Valley-based group could work remotely indefinitely as the pandemic waned.

A spokesperson for the company tells Fortune campus-office associates have been coming into the office more regularly since February. In a February email Walmart provided to Fortune Donna Morris chief people officer said it’s the company’s intention to create a collaborative environment on campus while working toward more flexibility.

“Our ways of working will vary across teams” she wrote. “We believe it’s important that we aren’t overly prescriptive and in the nature of flexibility we all need to be open to ambiguity. We will not mandate in and out of office days or start and finish times.”

She left it open to bosses to decide what meetings can be attended in-person and on-campus but added that the company believes “it’s important to be together in our offices the majority of the time” writing that Walmart’s culture leadership relationship building and creativity all benefit when workers are together.

2. Amazon

Amazon delivery and warehouse workers continued to provide goods throughout lockdown reportedly dealing with grueling conditions while corporate employees worked from home. In October 2021 Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained in a company memo that Amazon continues to be in “a stage of experimenting learning and adjusting for a while as we emerge from this pandemic.”

In said company memo which Amazon referred Fortune to when asked for comment Jassy allows directors on individual teams to decide how many days their reports should come into the office. Jassy maintained that the company is flexible but that Amazon workers should live close enough to their office to come in within a day’s notice.

In September Jassy made it clear that Amazon isn’t looking to push an office mandate any time soon. “We don’t have a plan to require people to come back. We don’t right now. But we’re going to proceed adaptively as we learn” he said.

3. Apple

CEO Tim Cook has pushed corporate employees slowly back to the office under a hybrid model.

“For many of you I know that returning to the office represents a long-awaited milestone and a positive sign that we can engage more fully with the colleagues who play such an important role in our lives” Cook said. “For others it may also be an unsettling change.”

Employees were asked to come into the office beginning April 11th reaching a minimum of three in-person days by March 23rd. Many employees (about 76%) were dissatisfied and 56% reported that they were looking to quit.

Though Cook’s previous plans were thwarted by another round of COVID-19 infections Apple recently announced employees should save the date to come in three times a week starting September 5th.

Meanwhile Apple retail employees have been unionizing for better working conditions. It’s working: Apple agreed to make work schedules at all of its retail stores more flexible.

Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

4. CVS Health

Many pharmacists and other retail workers stayed in stores during the pandemic to take care of customers’ increasing medical needs says Erin Britt director of corporate communications at CVS Health.

Corporate employees were ushered back to the office starting March 15th. “As part of our new hybrid work format most corporate employees are spending two to three days each week at one of our office locations and working virtually on the other days” Britt tells Fortune.

5. UnitedHealth Group

UnitedHealth Group has implemented all three work models: “hybrid fully telecommute and core on-site” with an emphasis on flexible work according to an official statement the company sent Fortune.

The healthcare and insurance company pointed out that they’ve always had both remote and on-site employees but the bulk of workers right now are mostly hybrid.

“The hybrid model will apply to many of our traditionally office-based employees who will now average about three days per week in the office” reads the statement. “The hybrid model is flexible and based on manager discretion.”

6. Exxon Mobil

On-site employees seemingly remained working in person through the pandemic; in March 2020 an article on the company’s site read “For those employees whose work requires them to be at one of our facilities we have put additional safety measures in place.”

Employees based in Houston (where Exxon plans to move its headquarters to next year) were expected to return to office five days a week starting mid-May of 2021 according to Bloomberg.

“Most of our Houston-campus employees are back in the office while continuing to benefit from our workplace flexibility programs” Todd Spitler Corporate Media Relations Senior Advisor tells Fortune. He adds that while the company believes that “business is best run from our offices and workplaces” there are workforce flexibility programs that can be approved by a supervisor.

7. Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett was one of the first leaders to publicly question if people would ever return to the office after the pandemic. Charlie Munger vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway continued Buffett’s sentiment in February 2022 saying that a large portion of workers who would rather not be in the office would remain that way forever.

There’s no public official statement on the company’s policy but when Fortune called headquarters an administrative worker revealed that each branch is making its own decisions with HR on whether employees will return to office.

8. Alphabet

Alphabet’s subsidiary Google is bringing corporate workers back to headquarters on a hybrid schedule.

Google’s corporate employees were expected to return to the office three days a week starting April 2022. A representative informed Fortune that the decision was made in light of employee feedback. But there’s still room for flexibility as “employees who need more time before returning can also request a work-from-home extension.”

Feedback on the corporate roll-out of return to office varied based on the employee but the company has received backlash for its pay adjustments based on where remote workers are located.

But Google’s extended workforce—which includes vendors and temporary staff who work on short-term projects—was compensated for time spent off explains a representative to Fortune: “Throughout the pandemic members of our extended workforce who were affected by reduced office schedules and closures were compensated for the time they would have worked.”

9. McKesson

McKesson’s frontline healthcare workers continued to work during the pandemic. “During the midst of a pandemic thousands of Team McKesson members continue to work every day in order to deliver vital medical products to the frontline in the fight against COVID-19” its website reads.

An Indeed poll of about 4000 McKesson employees found that 61% said they could work remotely. As of now the company has advertised both remote and in-person positions. Reviews on Glassdoor from employees emphasize the company’s flexibility; one from March 2022 says “employs an office as a destination approach where you go to the office to collaborate but perform your duties remotely.”

McKesson did not respond to requests for comment.

10. AmerisourceBergen

The drug wholesale company is “working under a hybrid model called the ‘Work Smart Platform’ meaning that team members are encouraged to work from home and come into the office when they desire” spokeswoman Mackenzie Liberatori told The Mercury in October 2021.

AmerisourceBergen didn’t provide Fortune with details on its return-to-office policies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmR5Y2l0eXRpbWVzLmNvbS9sZ2J0L0ZpdmUtV29ydGgtRmluZGluZy1Nb3ZpZS1zaG9ydC1LYWVwZXJuaWNrLWljZS1jcmVhbS1hbmQtbW9yZS83Mzc1OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five Worth Finding: Movie short 'Kaepernick' ice cream and more,"Dana Aliya Levinson in Fraud.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

Yuval Boger: Hello Thomas and thank you for joining me today.

Thomas Ehmer: Hi Yuval pleasure.

Yuval: So who are you and what do you do?

Thomas: That’s a good question Yuval and because I know the podcast I prepared a bit. I’m a bit of a superposition and it depends really on whom you ask. So for my band I’m the keyboard player for my kids I am the dad. But I think for this podcast I’ll tell you what I’m doing in my business. I’m one of the co-founders in the Merck group Merck KGaA. We are not Merck & Co. so there are two different independent companies. We have to tell this every time. So if you listen from the US we operate under EMD Serono. Rest of world we are Merck KGaA. And some eight years ago I was looking for novel technologies. I’m still looking for novel technologies and we did found a quantum task force with the objective to check if it makes sense that our company takes care of quantum technologies. It does. Yeah and then I’m a physicist by training. I look mainly at all applications that are novel to our company and should make sense. I’m a bit of a troublemaker because I bring technologies in-house that we don’t know yet how to use or we want to use but don’t have budget and so on. So that’s what I do for a living. Eight years

Yuval: wow.

Thomas: Yes.

Yuval: Really one of the pioneers. So let’s go back eight months. What have you learned in the last eight months about quantum and quantum readiness that maybe you didn’t know before that?

Thomas: Eight months is February. What did I learn in the last eight months? So I think what is confirming is that we have a very good emerging quantum computing community. I very much like all these conferences and it’s always good to see that we independent on whom you ask it seems that we are a community who wants to work together. Yeah and I think this is as some might say we approach quantum winter. We don’t know. But I think it’s good to see that there are still some brave people who carry the flag and work together. I see also that a lot of novel quantum computing architectures make it close to the market or are close to the market. So it’s really good to see. And I mean personally I was keen to see the recent announcement from Quantinuum for example where they have for example logical qubits apparently entangled. Eight years ago we didn’t even know how to build a single qubit. Now we have logical qubits at least in some claim that they have and I trust them. So this is interesting to see. And also the quantum communication part people are really getting keen on all these quantum key distribution communication protocols and so on. So that’s yeah. There’s not a single thing. I think it’s just really exploding. That’s good to see how far we move.

Yuval: In your company what do you see as the key application for quantum? Is it drug discovery or is it more things like optimization supply chain and so on?

Thomas: It depends on whom you ask. So we are super interested in quantum applications because once they come if ever they come they might be transformative. There’s so much hope and hype on drug discovery. Personally I’m not really a big fan or believer that computational drug discovery is outperforming wet drug discovery. So that’s my personal take. I think it’s a partnership and everybody’s betting on artificial intelligence. So drug discovery is a very complex thing and computational methods. Quantum computing is an additional computational method. So I think it’s a long way. There’s a very good paper out from the colleagues from Boehringer who did investigate if quantum computing ever will work. So it looks like we need new algorithms. So that’s my take. And the other problems logistics problems this is how it started for me actually to dive into quantum computing. So some years back the D-Wave were the first ones on the market with their traveling salesperson optimization. I still think it’s a miracle that we have these annealing things. And apparently so these ultra wicked complex problems might benefit also from quantum computing. I’m a bit undecided. I mean we see the three classes simulation optimization and machine learning. And yeah for our company none of them currently is relevant from an application perspective. But if they will come to maturity likely the material sciences is also of important.

Yuval: It’s very popular these days to talk about chat GPT moment a moment where AI moved from science fiction to we got to do it now. What do you think the quantum chat GPT or the quantum GPT moment is going to look like?

Thomas: The quantum that I have no clue. So I think the GPT moment was when everybody and their sister and brother were exposed to a functionality they could never imagine which is mimicking human intelligence. Actually it does not but it’s mimicking and it’s very convincing. So I think we will see how this develops compared to quantum. I have actually no clue. I could imagine that eventually something like this communication protocols might have an impact if everybody could just plug in whatever app to have a quantum secured point to point communication without any agency being able to listen in without me knowing they listen in. So this might be eventually one of these which has mass impact because I think quantum computing per se is rather an expert-ish niche co-processor thing. So I’m not sure how to. It’s a good question. I have to ask my guys what they think.

Yuval: You mentioned community earlier. And I know you’re part of a community of several I think German companies that work together to develop quantum. Could you tell me a little bit about that? And also related to that are you worried about other pharma companies about collaborating with other pharma companies to do quantum or right now a rising tide lifts all boats?

Thomas: Yes. So the yes is to the last question. So the company you mentioned at the beginning so it’s an association called QUTAC stands for German Quantum Technology Application Consortium. We have a very cool homepage. And it’s an association of the 13 big German companies. I don’t want to mention them all because otherwise the podcast would be over. What we are doing we organize ourselves in several streams and with the focus to identify quantum technology use cases that we could work on either as developers or co-developers or application user guidance for the developers. Independent from our own let’s say business. For example we work together with automotive or pharma and reinsurers logistics companies on let’s say logistics problems. Everybody has their problems and we test out different approaches on knapsack etc. So that’s one thing. And the other thing is we share the burden to evaluate vendors potential service providers. And by being attractive enough if as a partner you manage to convince QUTAC you not only have one customer but you would have 13 customers. So that’s the main point. And also I think it’s very helpful. All of us have relatively small quantum teams. So these are big worldwide corporations. I mean BMW SAP Bühringer etc. And all have relatively small quantum teams. And it’s very comfortable for us as a team to not be alone so that we have a bit of a peers and we can share interests. Regarding the pharma guys I mean it started I think at the Q2B several years back. There was an initiative that we all say everybody claims we can speed up drug discovery or drug development or we can bring better drugs to the world by quantum computing. Who knows how this works? Nobody did. So it’s also very open very collaborative. And I think it’s rather a friend-ish approach bosonic approach that we work together instead of competition because currently it’s really pre-competitive. There’s also the Pistoia Alliance who is setting up one pharma consortium thing. There are several pharma consortiums emerging. So that’s quite open. And the third part I forgot. Now I think you answered everything here.

Yuval: When you think about QUTAC what is the issue that you’re facing right now? What is the key thing that you’re looking for a solution?

Thomas: So we have different streams. So one stream we started focusing on the logistics and the material sciences streams. It looks like currently we have reshuffled a bit. So one part of us is looking at generative components. So we’re working on quantum generative network so QGANs to check in how far they perform better than classical GANs. We have a paper out. You can make sense yourself if it’s worthwhile or not. I mean it’s early days but this is where we jointly work on because everybody is interested of course in these generative networks. The other thing is in the logistics part we work on knapsack problems to understand can quantum do better knapsack things. And there’s another stream which is composed of different people. They work mainly on material science topics so quantum chemistry using quantum computers. I don’t have too much insight in that but it’s always shared problems that we say how can you better do ground energy finding whatever. What is quantum Monte Carlo? Where does it make sense? Where does it not make sense? And the third stream I mentioned is really looking at infrastructure from different perspectives. So we are also writing there some papers with the target audience of being other quantum computing users to guide them if it makes sense to go on neutral atoms. I mean you know neutral atoms or we’re just working on an ion trap paper. And the other part is also political communication. And in principle also we wanted to do a bit of education so help grow talent for our companies. But that’s not so far progressed as we would have wanted just due to the lack of resource we have.

Yuval: You mentioned the comparison between computational chemistry or using quantum computing for computational chemistry versus wet labs. In a company like Merck how much communication is there between the people who are actually working on developing drugs and people like yourself who are dealing with future technologies?

Thomas: That’s a good question. So I think there is enough communication. There is even a common ground. There are just not enough solutions. I mean we have recently discussed the potential to do I don’t know what was this the idea to use quantum computer annealing approaches to find binding pockets in complex targets. And when I talk to our researchers who do the wet stuff or other computational stuff they said it sounds interesting. On the other hand we already have 15 methods or 20 methods and I have 15 people so I just don’t have capacity to digest this. So I think there is an appetite that it’s really tough to understand this added value given that you have new ways of thinking. So quantum algorithm is using quantum features nobody really understands what these are even the quantum guys don’t. And then I mean how to translate your existing problems in a way that you can make additional value for using quantum components or quantum core processor. That’s not easy. And unfortunately most have objectives that are not so much forward looking and have time to think what will be happening in 10 5 years because in the end you need to deliver the next target. And it’s just a bit of operational pressure. I mean it’s a bit of a dance and mainly of interest so people listening with interest but it’s just currently it’s more playful with the intent to detect good things but it’s not a threat currently if we would not look at it I think.

Yuval: Do you see a need for a company like Merck to purchase a quantum computer anytime soon in the next few years or everything is on the cloud as far as you’re concerned?

Thomas: I mean there are different answers to that. I think it depends on what you want to achieve so if we want to contribute as a material supplier for example because we have the very best isotopes and the very best gas to do nitrogen vacancy whatever stuff well so do we need a quantum computer for that? Maybe not. If we want to learn to program it there are so many solutions out in the cloud. I doubt that we need one in-house. And then there’s on the other hand the approach that the American clinics currently are doing. So every clinic who thinks they have interest in novel technologies they put a quantum computer on site which is then I think rather a symbol because if every day you pass a quantum computer eventually it triggers your way of thinking what could I do with it? So I think for this sake more as a symbol it could make sense. And I mean it looks good. The machines depending on which machines you use but I think definitely from a productive use point it doesn’t make sense this moment in time. I would not even know whom to hire to maintain and operate these things because they are very fragile and you need to calibrate all these. And then the question is also which technology do you want to have? So you would need to buy one of each flavors modalities how they’re called. I would not know what to choose. So therefore I think it’s also not from a financial investment. Maybe it’s not a good value investment because the next generation makes the other one obsolete. So it’s not that it’s getting more and more from a collector’s viewpoint that you can collect. I have the very first I don’t know a QuEra machine and then I put it somewhere. I have the very first IBM machine with 127 qubits. I think it doesn’t make sense.

Yuval: Germany is one of the countries that’s investing heavily in quantum on the national level. And do you feel some of the results of this investment or do you think it’s going to be years out?

Thomas: So personally I feel some of it because I’m also profiting from a federal funded project which I’m very grateful for because otherwise we would not do this project because it’s just too risky. And because we have this funding I can spend part of my time to think on things I would not think for. And the interesting part is that I think we heard this on several talks also on conferences that because you think on quantum algorithms you detect sometimes solutions that are completely independent from quantum that help your business nevertheless. So that’s one aspect. Do I see other… I mean Germany spends a lot of money. The UK does France does. Others do too. I can’t really say that I have seen quick returns but I see that there is a lot of attention and even a bit of understanding in the decision makers. It’s moving into a direction which is at least they want to understand what it is and it’s quite complex but I think it’s more technology friendly these days than it was in the past. Unfortunately we have the situation in the world. So I think everywhere funds are cut for fundamental research. But I mean that’s I think independent from the aim that we want to spend much money on that. I mean one thing on the other hand is what I find a bit disappointing is that we have a bit of this fragmentation in Germany. We have all the land and everybody wants to do their own valley. So we have a quantum valley in Munich we have a Saxony valley. So in Germany everybody is a bit of building their own center and everybody is in the center of their world. I’m not sure how this is in other countries. I think France is by definition different that everything goes to Paris and then you have to see what’s coming out there. But the original question is yes I think it makes sense. You slowly see. I think we’re a bit far behind. Others started earlier and have more mature startup scenes but we’re catching up.

Yuval: You spoke earlier about the quantum winter and also mentioned that you’ve been doing this for eight years. Do you think there is a risk that a company like Merck says you know what we’ve been at this for a while. Let’s shelve it and come back in three years and maybe things will be different.

Thomas: I think there is in principle the risk because we are not doing this as a profession. Everybody’s doing this as their hobby. We have a very small team under our digital just forget but we have a central function and we have a digital unit. And somewhere in this area we have a unit who is doing quantum and AI lab. And these are not many people. And they spend a very small part of the time doing what they do. And what I’m doing thanks to my boss and my boss’s boss and everything so I am doing this on top of my job. I have zero budget except the federal funding so there is not much to cut. Because otherwise it’s late in the evening we have this call after business hours. So I think many people are committed despite not having money because it’s not like in other companies where you have a really a small team and hire a few students. For us it’s relatively small. And I rather see that we are doing more than is visible to the top management. And when we did this task force people were surprised how active we are. If you’re not in the field of course you don’t see it. But then when you say we should do something about quantum computing you see that we’re relatively well networked. I think that’s… Does this answer the question?

Yuval: Absolutely. So hypothetically if you could have dinner with one of the quantum greats dead or alive who would that person be?

Thomas: I’m prepared so I’m not so… I don’t fake surprise. And it took me a long time to think. And I’m in a very lucky position that I already had lunch with some of my idols they’re alive. Therefore I go for the dead ones. And this is a tough thing. I think I would go for David Bohm or John Wheeler because I really like the way they put more into quantum which has to do with consciousness research self-perception the miracles of the observer what is the observer so the bigger picture. Currently I’m tending in my philosophical interpretation of the word a bit to the monistic view which is maybe a bit over-exaggerated. But the miracle that we have something which is self-perception and we have something which is an external world. And how come? We don’t know. And there are so many different interpretations and I think Bohm did a very good… with his implicate order he had a very good idea to think about that we need new ways of expressing ourselves if I understood this correct. And I’ve seen some rare interviews back on YouTube with him and he seems to be a very super interesting person. But he’s dead unfortunately so no chance.

Yuval: Very well. Thomas thank you so much for joining me today.

Thomas: Yeah thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.

In October 2021 the parent company of the world’s most popular social media platform decided to change its name from Facebook (FB) to Meta Platforms (META) as part of an ongoing shift to the metaverse.

As a result the corporation created a new business unit called the “Reality Labs” that will be in charge of developing this virtual realm.

META stock shed 62% of its value in 2022 as the compnay grappled with poor financial performance and macro woes. It seems that some of Facebook’s backers have fled the scene in fear that this pivot could threaten to derail the firm’s financial performance in the future.

Who are Facebook shareholders at the moment and why should investors care? In this article we share the details about who owns the most shares of Facebook and what influence they might have on the future of the business.

What is Meta Platforms (META)?

Meta Platforms is the name of the company that was formerly known as Facebook. Founded in 2004 by a group of Harvard students including its current CEO Mark Zuckerberg after they created a social app called The Facebook.

Since then Facebook has grown to become the world’s largest social media platform with approximately 2.9 billion monthly active users. In addition the parent company acquired two widely successful mobile apps Instagram and WhatsApp whose results are now being reported under the segment Family of Apps.

As per the latest quarterly report Meta Platforms’ Family of Apps had a combined monthly active people (MAP) of 3.65 billion – almost half of the world’s population.

On 28 October last year Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms. The new name is considered to be a better reflection of the business’s aim to become a leading player in the up-and-coming metaverse industry. The ticker symbol assigned to the company’s Class A common shares was changed from FB to META.

In 2022 Meta Platforms generated a revenue of over 116 billion U.S. dollars a slight decrease on the previous year. The majority of Meta’s profits come from its advertising revenue which amounted to 113.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. Meta Platforms employs over 80000 people.

The groups share price rose in February when it beat analysts estimates for its Q4 earnings release with earning per share coming in at $1.76 and revenue at $32.17bn vs $31.53bn expected according to Refinitiv.

Facebook biggest shareholders: What is Mark Zuckerberg’s stake?

Who are the stakeholders of Facebook? According to Meta Platform’s latest annual report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Mark Zukerberg owns over 800000 Class A Shares and over 300000000 Class B Shares. The next biggest share holders are the groups CFO Susan Li and Chief Product Officer Christopher K. Cox.

3258 stockholders of record held the company’s Class A common stock by the end of December 2022.

Other 5% shareholders inculde BlackRock FMR LLC and Vanguard.

As of 31 March 2023 Meta had 2215650705 shares of Class A common stock and 350578831 shares of Class B common stock outstanding.

Holders of Class B META shares are entitled to have 10 votes for every share they own while Class A stockholders only have one vote per share. These votes can be cast during any stockholders’ meeting to decide on the company’s affairs.

The annual report also disclosed that there were 2.3 billion Class A common stock of Meta Platforms in circulation by 28 January 2022 along with 412.86 million Class B common stock.

This information is important for Meta Platforms shareholders and prospective investors. All decisions concerning the company’s vision future and strategy will have to be approved by Zuckerberg as he holds the majority of the company’s voting power.

According to data compiled by Refinitiv as of June 2022 other top executive holders of the company’s stock include Michael Todd Schroepfer David Wehner David Fischer Jennifer Newstead and Peter Thiel.

Institutional Facebook shareholders

The list of Facebook major shareholders as of August 2022 includes some prominent fund management companies. Data from Refinitiv put the list of top Meta Platforms shareholders as: The Vanguard Group Fidelity Management BlackRock Institutional State Street Global and T. Rowe Price Associates.

The Vanguard Group: 7.9% stake

The Vanguard Group is one of the world’s largest asset management firms. The US-based company had total assets under management (AUM) of approximately $7.3trn in 2021. According to Statista Vanguard's AUM increased more than sevenfold in the decade and a half since 2005.

Many individual and corporate investors may own META stock through one of the investment vehicles that Vanguard offers such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). As of 30 June 2022 Vanguard had more than 30 million investors.

According to Refinitiv’s data as of 13 August The Vanguard Group held 180 million of META shares accounting for 7.9% of the company’s stock.

Fidelity Management: 4.9% stake

Fidelity Investments is one of America’s oldest financial services firms. In 1943 Edward C. Johnson II took over the Fidelity Fund founded in 1930. In 1946 he founded Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR Co.) to act as investment advisor to the Fund.

In 2022 Fidelity managed $4.2trn in assets for its customers. It’s led by CEO Abigail Johnson the founder’s granddaughter who took over from her father in 2014 and has been chairman since 2016.

According to Refinitiv’s data as of 13 August Fidelity Management held 112 million shares in Meta Platforms accounting for 4.9% of the company’s stock.

BlackRock: 4.4% stake

Blackrock is another US-based asset management firm that offers access to the stock market via a wide range of passive and actively managed vehicles such as ETFs and mutual funds.

The firm created the iShares family of investment products including the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) and iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN).

According to Statista as of the first quarter of 2022 BlackRock had total assets under management (AUM) of around $9.6trn.

According to Refinitiv’s data as of 13 August BlackRock held 101 million META shares accounting for 4.4% of the company’s stock.

State Street Global: 4.1% stake

State Street is one the major shareholders of Facebook. Its passively and actively managed investment funds hold META stock. This financial services firm managed $3.47bn of assets as of the second quarter of 2022.

State Street’s stake in Meta Platforms was 4.1% which corresponds to 92.7 million shares according to Refinitiv’s data as of 13 August.

T Rowe Price Associates: 3.3% stake

Last year Facebook-parent Meta effectively pushed back its timetable for rolling out end-to-end encryption by default across its various social platforms with an executive saying the privacy-enhancing change would not happen until sometime in 2023.

The delay came under a new spotlight this week after news broke that Facebook messages sent through Messenger and obtained by law enforcement had been used to charge a Nebraska teen and her mother with having an illegal abortion.

The case began before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June and Meta said the search warrant it received did not mention abortion. But to some digital privacy experts it highlighted the risks women now face with their online data in a post-Roe America — and the urgency for tech companies like Facebook to enable end-to-end encryption by default.

End-to-end encryption refers to the practice of coding messages so that only the sender and recipient can see their contents without the messaging platform having any access to them. While a large subset of users may not actively consider the level and type of encryption their messages have it is becoming increasingly important that they do — or some experts say that tech companies make a choice for them.

“The end of Roe throws into sharp relief the paramount importance of turning on [end-to-end encryption] by default instead of making users navigate security and privacy settings for themselves” said Rianna Pfefferkorn a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory whose work focuses on encryption.

Facebook’s long road to accomplishing that however highlights the broader challenges facing the industry and the tradeoffs between privacy and convenience that companies and users increasingly have to make.

Facebook’s evolving approach to encryption

Meta’s mobile messaging platform WhatsApp already offers default end-to-end encryption as well as encrypted backups of users’ messages. In recent years Meta has worked to expand and improve its encryption options for its other services.

In April 2021 a Facebook executive said the company wouldn’t be able to implement end-to-end encryption by default across all its products until “sometime in 2022 at the earliest.” Seven months later another Facebook executive Antigone Davis penned an op-ed piece in a British publication revealing the option wouldn’t be available “until sometime in 2023.”

Facebook along with other tech companies has long had to contend with pressure from government officials around the world over making messages accessible to law enforcement agencies in order to prevent bad actors from using their platforms for illegal activities.

In her piece Davis noted the “ongoing debate about how tech companies can continue to combat abuse and support the vital work of law enforcement if we can’t access your messages.” She said the company was “engaging with privacy and safety experts civil society and governments to make sure we get this right.”

Days after the Nebraska news this week Meta announced it would start testing default end-to-end encryption for Facebook Messenger as well as a “secure storage” option for encrypted messages on Facebook. A Meta spokesperson said the timing of updates was unrelated.

As part of its updates Meta appeared to offer an example of how it’s trying to walk the line between bolstering privacy and combating abuse. The company said it would only be able to see encrypted messages in live conversations if users report them for example over harassment concerns.

Meta also reiterated it plans to extend the default option to all its messaging services “sometime in 2023.”

Despite the delay Meta’s encryption goals appear closer to being realized than many of its messaging peers.

“Facebook recognizes how important encryption is for protecting our personal privacy” Pfefferkorn said. “To that end it has been working for years on making Messenger more like WhatsApp.”

What you need to know to protect your messages

Beyond Meta’s suite of apps it can be hard to keep straight the level of encryption provided by popular messaging services.

Twitter does not encrypt direct messages on its platform something the platform’s possible future owner Elon Musk has said he wants to change. Other messaging apps such as Signal do offer end-to-end encryption by default while Telegram allows users to opt in. SMS text messages aren’t encrypted at all.

Some platforms such as Apple’s iMessage have a more nuanced encryption profile across devices and services. While iMessage is end-to-end encrypted by default message backups to iCloud may not be and the key to decrypt those messages is also stored on iCloud. That means if law enforcement gain access to your iCloud account they could theoretically have both pieces of the puzzle to access your messages — even from an encrypted service.

“If you use iMessage turn off iCloud backups [and] turn off iCloud backups of your WhatsApp” said Laura Edelson a postdoctoral researcher with the Cybersecurity for Democracy initiative at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. “The first thing to do if you are an iPhone user is going to your iPhone settings and see what’s being backed up.”

In general she said the ideal would be using a messaging platform that is end-to-end encrypted by default. But if you do use a platform such as Facebook Messenger that isn’t Edelson recommends going into your settings and enabling it. She also suggests nudging the people you text to use more secure platforms such as Signal.

But as more Americans weigh encryption options in the wake of the Roe ruling it’s important to be mindful of potential drawbacks too. For example losing your phone or forgetting your password could mean those messages are lost forever.

While WhatsApp currently offers encrypted backups most other messaging apps do not and backing up your messages could make them potentially vulnerable in a way that defeats the purpose of encrypting them in the first place.

“We have trained users that they can access their messages anywhere from any computer just by logging in and that if they need to there is some third party who can recover them” Edelson said. “But what inherently comes with that if there is some third party who can recover your messages for you they can recover your messages for anyone else.”

Still for those concerned about the shifting legal landscape the tradeoffs may be worth it.

“No one needs absolute privacy until the moment they need absolute privacy” she said “and then they really need it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL21ldGEtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1kb29yZGFzaC10by1kZWxpdmVyLW1hcmtldHBsYWNlLWl0ZW1zLWluLXRoZS11cy0xMjIwODE0MDAzNDlfMS5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL21ldGEtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1kb29yZGFzaC10by1kZWxpdmVyLW1hcmtldHBsYWNlLWl0ZW1zLWluLXRoZS11cy0xMjIwODE0MDAzNDlfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta partners with DoorDash to deliver Marketplace items in the US,"Meta has partnered with online delivery platform DoorDash to deliver Marketplace items located up to 15 miles (nearly 25 km) away in the US.

DoorDash will only deliver items that are small enough to fit in the trunk of a car and drivers are expected to make deliveries within 48 hours citing the WSJ The Verge reported.

Either way it sounds like a helpful option for anyone who is not able to pick up an item themselves.

It also fills a gap in Facebook Marketplace's existing local delivery options which only lets you get larger items delivered through a service called Dolly the report said.

The service is limited to a little over two dozen cities throughout the US and lets users connect with one or two local ""helpers"" that will load bulky items -- like a refrigerator bookshelf or air conditioner -- into a pickup truck and deliver them to your house for a fee.

Aside from Dolly and DoorDash Meta also lets Marketplace sellers ship items directly to a buyer's address.

As per the report it is still not exactly clear how many Marketplace users currently have the option for DoorDash deliveries or how much it costs.

Both Meta and DoorDash confirmed the initiative to the WSJ and say they have already been testing it in several cities in the US.

Lady Gaga brought her Chromatica Ball to the tri-state area Thursday night soaring her way through a spectacular sold-out concert at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford NJ.

Gaga opened her 22-song set with the one-two-three punch of “Bad Romance” “Just Dance” and “Poker Face” before transitioning to tracks from the tour’s namesake album. It’s rare to see an artist perform their biggest hits straight out of the gate in live shows and while the audience had the floor shaking with energy from that iconic first “oh-oh-oh-oh-oh” it was not a dance party for the lady of the hour.

Instead Gaga was perched atop the stage in an avant-garde costume that confined her movements signifying how she’s been put in a box throughout her career as the radio-dominating meat dress-wearing pop star who had the world’s eyes on her at all times in the 2010s.

But the Gaga of 2022 is just as magnificent — and stronger than ever before. Her choreography was crisp during fan favorites like “911” and “Babylon” after fibromyalgia forced her to cancel her last tour and her vocals on a piano rendition of “Born This Way” and her powerful “Top Gun: Maverick” theme song “Hold My Hand” left fans awestruck.

The show was more macabre than Gaga’s past tours but so is “Chromatica” the cathartic house album she wrote about healing and released in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic that almost upended her plans to get back on the road.

At one point she lay on a floating platform reminiscent of an operating table while wearing a blood-stained latex bodysuit that called back to her shocking 2009 VMAs performance. Later a video interlude showed Gaga reciting a manifesto about art with the same brooding cadence as her vampiric character in “American Horror Story: Hotel.”

Even with its dark themes and brutalist stage design the theatric Chromatica Ball turned into one big celebration by the end of the evening. “Stupid Love” literally brought the heat with flames rocketing up to the nosebleeds and making the crowd sweat even more than they already were in the dead of summer followed by “Rain on Me” one of the most euphoric performances the stadium has seen in a while.

While Gaga did not announce whether any of her idols were in the crowd for her hometown show (she famously shouted out Liza Minnelli at Madison Square Garden in her 2011 HBO special) she did take the time to pay tribute to those who came before her.

Gaga dedicated her breathtaking “A Star Is Born” ballad “Always Remember Us This Way” to her frequent collaborator Tony Bennett who retired from performing in 2021 after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and she reminded her Little Monsters that Jersey’s own Bruce Springsteen inspired “The Edge of Glory.”

He may have taken seven rounds Saturday night to beat Pedro Campa at Resorts World Events Center. But former unified lightweight champion Teofimo Lopez ensured “The Takeover” is back on track.

Lopez ended his junior welterweight debut by flooring Campa in the seventh round with a crisp one-two and following with a flurry that prompted referee Tony Weeks to stop the bout at the 2:14 mark.

The brash 25-year-old celebrated his first knockout victory since Dec. 14 2019 by dancing to Meek Mill’s “House Party” and uncorking the customary backflip that often accompanies his victories amid cheers from a sellout crowd of 3553.

“I’m not going to lie there was a lot of my mind. I literally almost died in my last fight” Lopez said afterward seeming more relieved than pleased. “That was weighing on my mind. I had to clear it out.”

The fight Lopez (17-1 13 knockouts) referenced was the Nov. 27 2021 upset loss to George Kambosos Jr. who spoiled the first defense of the unified 135-pound championship the Las Vegas resident claimed in 2020 from pound-for-pound great Vasiliy Lomachenko. Respiratory issues stymied his ability that night.

But so too did an unfocused reckless approach that left him far too vulnerable.

A nine-month layoff helped Lopez recover — physically and mentally — from the first loss of his professional career and rebuild the confidence he lost against Kambosos.

“We worked on that a lot” said Lopez’s father and head trainer Teofimo Sr. “His condition was just perfect for tonight.”

Indeed Lopez looked strong and crisp in his new weight class free from the rigors that come with cutting the additional five pounds. He fought with composure and poise working behind his jab and blending power punches and counters against Campa (34-2-1 23 KOs) who set the tempo by pressing forward.

CompuBox counted 136 connections for Lopez compared to 83 for Campa. Lopez also landed 86 power punches including the two that dropped Campa early in the seventh round — signaling the beginning of the end for the 30-year-old unknown from Merida Mexico.

The outcome was the expectation though. Lopez’s future at junior welterweight will be determined by prospective bouts against unified champion Josh Taylor former champion Regis Prograis and other 140-pounders of championship ilk like Jose Ramirez and Jose Zepeda.

Another potential foe awaits Lopez on a prospective Dec. 10 pay-per-view on ESPN. That would be burgeoning superstar Ryan Garcia whose promoter Oscar De La Hoya enjoyed Lopez’s victory from a ringside seat.

“If Josh Taylor is too busy with his wedding and there’s nobody else around because the WBA belt is taken and the WBC is going to be fought with Zepeda and Prograis then so (expletive) be it” Lopez said of facing Garcia.

Zayas impresses in co-feature

Top 154-pound prospect Xander Zayas (14-0 1o KOs) impressed again in the co-feature stopping Elias Espadas (22-5 15 KOs) in the fifth round to preserve his undefeated record.

The 19-year-old Puerto Rican dropped Espadas in the first round and added another knockdown in the fifth to trigger a stoppage from referee Russell Mora.

It was a big loss in which he relinquished four belts to now de-throned George Kambosos. But Lopez the former prodigy has returned to Las Vegas to move up and make his debut as a 140lbs super lightweight. He is scheduled to face Mexican-born Pedro Campa inside the Resorts World Events Arena Saturday.

As he prepares to make his much-anticipated return to the ring tonight headlining for Top Rank Boxing perhaps his greatest foe is the one that resides within. The battle for mental wellness has consumed the Brooklyn-born fighter one that he’s acknowledged publicly as critical to his overall quality of life.

“Self care self love. Outside of everything my sport brings to the table everything that I’ve done in the sport. I mean I’ve been in the game for 21 years now” Lopez said. “So my work ethic doesn’t change. I only grow I only get better but you can’t forget about you. I have to take care of my mental health above everything.”

One of Top Rank’s most bankable fighters Lopez is outspoken a treasure trove of hot takes who is evolving into a powerful puncher. Throw in the presence of his father/trainer Teofimo Sr. who isn’t short of audacious remarks and junior is the perfect combination of marketing gold and athletic potential.

As with all things boxing the packaging of this budding star has been convoluted by outside distractions. During the last two years he’s been married divorced became a father and continues to be estranged from his mother and sister.

When LVSportsBiz.com asked Lopez this week about what he’s learned about the grind to get back to the top he responded playfully with rap song lyrics “Don’t call it a comeback. I’ve been here for years.”

The work ahead of him is no joking matter though. Making his debut at 140 pounds this week means that he will tangle with fighters who possess more experience and are naturally adept to match his physical prowess.

The talented young boxer dubbed himself “The Takeover.” and made a rapid accession to the top of the 135-pound division through a viral knockout against Mason Mernard.

A win against veteran champion Richard Commey secured the IBF title and then came the big one –a career-defining victory over pound-for-pound legend Vasiliy Lomachenko inside of the MGM Grand Arena bubble during the 2020 COVID sports shutdown.

Subsequently he became the unified champion holding the IBF WBA and WBO titles.

He then lost his WBA WBO and IBF world lightweight titles to Kambosos Jr. in his first unified title defense held at the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City in November 2021.

The loss wasn’t just a professional nightmare it almost withered the Lopez to the brink of self harm.

In October of 2021 before the Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder trilogy in Las Vegas he revealed to reporters “People say what’s the sacrifice. People think sacrifice is killing people. But the sacrifice really is just love and that starts with you. That’s what happened with me. I took a step back and was like man I’m really thinking about killing myself. That’s how serious it got. Not once. Not twice. Maybe like three times. I was like that ain’t right. Why am I going to want to kill myself with the blessings that I’m receiving?”

The financial blessings of a colossal payday were murky for the fighter born to Honduran immigrants as the Kambosos event was delayed multiple times because of a positive COVID test from Lopez and promotional complications defined by a $6 million purse bid spat lost by the promoter he’s signed to Top Rank and won by flailing upstart Triller.

Leading up to the bout Lopez suffered what was revealed afterward as pneumomediastinum with extensive air in the retropharyngeal space.

He forced himself into the ring with pockets of air surrounding his chest heart and neck caused by a tear in the esophagus while he was rehydrating after weigh-in.

It would later be revealed that his physicians called it a life threatening condition. Dr. Peter Constantino told ESPN’s Mark Kriegel “He’s lucky he’s not dead. I mean really lucky.”

Now he’s back to press his luck headlining in Las Vegas the Mecca of Boxing. However if it were up to Lopez the location would’ve been on the east coast. “I really wanted to push this flight to Miami. I guess things didn’t work out in that sense.” when press as to why it didn’t work out Lopez responded ”I don’t really want to discuss why that happened because it’s controversial.”

As his professional story plays out Saturday in Las Vegas we asked Lopez what did he want people to know about him as a man.

“I’m a real man. We’re not just a one hit wonder. We’re here forever. I wasn’t man-made. I’m self made. I’m as real as it gets. As this world becomes more fake the less real we see around and that’s what they hate. But God is always gonna prevail god is always gonna win no matter what.” He continued “ People may not like the truth and if they don’t like it so let it kill them.”

His journey to mental wellness is just that a journey. Lopez is still seeking clarity and peace in his mind. All the while he has to take care of business against Campa at Resorts World. He’s an enormous -2500 betting favorite at BetMGM and Campa is +1000.

“With the grace of God I have to take care of my mental health everyday. I’m already the best in the world at 140 and Saturday night I will go to remind the world about that.”

Tickets for Lopez vs Campa are still available at the Resorts World Events Center in Las Vegas and the fight can be streamed on ESPN+.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhvb2suY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvc2VjLWZpbmVzLWhlZGdlLWZ1bmQtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1lbmRvd21lbnRz0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlaG9vay5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9zZWMtZmluZXMtaGVkZ2UtZnVuZC11bml2ZXJzaXR5LWVuZG93bWVudHM_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SEC Fines Over Ivy League Endowment Management Are Part of a Bigger Story,"Earlier this month Law360 reported on an interesting case involving a high-profile Connecticut-based private fund. The fund Deccan Value Investors LP was fined by the SEC as was its founder Vinit Bodas. Why? It had to do with two universities that had invested with Deccan and sought to withdrawn their money. The SEC felt that the universities had not received their money at a “reasonable pace” and it resulted in Deccan being fined $1.1 million and Bodas owing $500000.



The SEC cited texts in which Bodan requested that one of his colleagues go through the process slowly. “Why should we sell in advance and have other investors bear the cost of these fools” he wrote.



As it turns out there’s an even bigger story behind that. Writing at Air Mail William D. Cohan provided a deeper look at the issues facing Deccan — and identified the two universities that had opted to stop working with Deccan as Yale and Emory.



At the center of Cohan’s article are lawsuits between Bodan and John Malik Deccan’s COO. Malik’s suit against Bodan contends that Bodan changed how money was distributed among the firm’s partners giving Bodan a larger share. Malik also contends that Bodan forced him to engage in illicit activities. For his part Bodan has filed a lawsuit of his own against Malik arguing that Malik’s work was sub-par and has denied many of the things Malik accused him of.



It’s a story that gets more and more intricate the more you stare at it. That it also involves mammoth sums of money and well-known universities only makes it that much more intriguing — and leaves one wondering what the next twist in the case might be.

With all eyes on Taiwan and worries mounting around semiconductor supply the U.S. CHIPS Act is particularly timely. But it is not unique: Other countries similarly aspire to reduce their reliance on imported chips. Let’s explore. — Anna

From cheap as chips to billion-dollar incentives

U.S. president Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 into law earlier this week after the bill received broad bipartisan support in the House and Senate.

The H and I in CHIPS stand for “Helpful Incentives” hinting at the main component of the initiative: $52.7 billion in public subsidies.

Biden described the new bill on Twitter as “a once-in-a-generation law that invests in America by supercharging our efforts to make semiconductors here at home.”

Headlines often focus on the $52.7 billion subsidy tally but it is also interesting to look at how the dollar amount will be broken down:

“The final version of the act sets aside $52.7 billion for the research development and domestic manufacturing of semiconductors; $39 billion of that goes toward incentivizing manufacturers with $2 billion being used to create existing/legacy chips for automotive and defense — a shortage of the former has hamstrung carmakers unable to move unfinished vehicles. Another $13.2 billion will be invested in R&D and workforce development.” — Brian Heater

Potentially easing the chip shortage played a key role in building support for the bill as addressing this issue could also help fight inflation. But it also reflects a broader change: that semiconductors went from being perceived as a commodity to falling under the umbrella of “sovereign tech.”

Big Fund bigger fail?

The COVID-19 pandemic put into evidence that it was hazardous to rely solely on international supply for essential goods including chips which find a home in everything from cars and consumer gadgets to defense tech to well just about everything.

But the ability to control semiconductor manufacturing took a new level of urgency in light of the current geopolitical climate. Revived tensions around Taiwan which accounts for a crucial share of semiconductor manufacturing made the issue even more blatant this summer: The U.S. doesn’t want its chip supply to be at China’s whim. Reciprocally Beijing has been conducting massive efforts over the last decade to champion its domestic chip industry and reduce its dependency on Washington and its allies.

China’s semiconductor plan however has “largely failed to deliver” the Washington Post argued this week. In part because of corruption but also due to wider inefficiencies that are said to have caused anger among political leaders and will now go under review.

“Xi Jinping’s government” Bloomberg wrote “had allocated more than $100 billion to build up a domestic semiconductor sector so the country could break its dependence on the West. A key area of scrutiny is the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund — known within the industry as Big Fund — which had become Beijing’s primary vehicle for doling out capital to the country’s chipmakers.”

Will the European Union succeed where China failed? Only time will tell. But the EU Chips Act is similarly driven by a wish for sovereignty.

European fabs

Initially proposed by the European Commission in February the EU Chips Act has the ambition to “confront semiconductor shortages and strengthen Europe’s technological leadership.” And just like its U.S. equivalent it implies a certain amount of subsidies as part of the “43 billion euros of public and private investments” (approximately $44.4 billion) that it hopes to deploy.

“The proposal also includes a loosening of strict EU state aid rules that will allow Member States to provide financial support to novel ‘first of a kind’ chip fabs” TechCrunch reported. (“Fabs” is the name by which chip manufacturers are usually referred.)

The ability to offer incentives is already paying off for Germany and France which managed to attract two projects worth $17.55 billion and $5.88 billion respectively that European commissioner Thierry Breton mentioned on LinkedIn.

“A few weeks after Intel picked Germany’s Magdeburg for building a €17 billion semiconductor ‘mega factory’ it is now STMicroelectronics’ and GlobalFoundries’ turn to announce another massive investment of €5.7 billion to develop a chips factory venture in the French tech hub of Crolles near Grenoble” Breton wrote.

It is unclear how much money for the new plant comes from public pockets but the CEO of STMicroelectronics said it was a significant amount and French president Emmanuel Macron visited the site in person while announcing broader plans for the country’s microelectronics sector. Meanwhile Germany is also set to welcome additional investments from Bosch.

Boosting production capacity is a must if the EU wants to achieve its goal of doubling its current market share of the global semiconductor market to 20% in 2030. This might be more difficult for certain types of chips than others: “For more advanced chips the figure is closer to 90% of the market coming from Taiwan alone” TechCrunch’s Brian Heater reported. This is where innovation will have a key role to play.

From lab to fab

One of the three pillars of the EU Chips Act will focus on improving the transition “from lab to fab.” As for Biden he also hinted at innovation when he predicted that “the future of the microchip industry is going to be Made in America.”

Better chips are definitely a promising perspective and worth investigating. For instance a team of researchers at MIT the University of Houston and other institutions has found a material cubic boron arsenide that has better semiconductor properties than silicon. But there’s still work to do to find out how to apply this to actual chipmaking.

Startups might find a more direct way to bring innovation to the semiconductor sector. Some have already raised funding to do so and the U.S. CHIPS Act brings hope that others will follow.

With U.S. and European fabs being located in emerging hubs it will be particularly interesting to see if there’s a halo effect for startups. We had already been keeping an eye on the U.S. Midwest and we will now be paying even closer attention to Intel’s chosen site: Columbus Ohio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA4LzEzL2NoaW5lc2UtYmFja2VkLWJ1eWVyLXVrLW1pY3JvY2hpcC1wbGFudC1tYWRlLWNvbXBvbmVudHMtZm91bmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chinese-backed buyer of UK microchip plant made components found in Russian missiles,"Components manufactured by the Chinese-owned buyer of Britain's biggest microchip plant have been discovered inside nuclear-capable Russian missiles launched at Ukraine.

A Kh-101 cruise missile recovered from a Ukrainian battlefield contained parts made by Nexperia a tech business attempting to buy the Newport Wafer Fab factory in South Wales.

The discovery by researchers at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) sparked immediate calls for the sale to be blocked on national security grounds.

Tom Tugendhat chairman of Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee said the disclosure “reminds us of the importance of protecting our industry from exploitation by our enemies”.

He added: “Today with Nexperia’s plan to buy Newport Wafer Fab it also shows why we need to defend our key strategic assets from those who could use them against us.”

Newport Wafer Fab was sold in July last year to Nexperia a Dutch company owned by state-backed Chinese business Wingtech despite concerns the deal was handing control of vital electronics supplies to a foreign power.

The Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng halted the £63m acquisition in May pending the result of an official investigation under the National Security and Investment Act. A government spokesman declined to comment.

After the February invasion of Ukraine Britain led the Western world in tightening trade sanctions to choke off Russia’s supply of advanced technology. So-called “dual use” goods have been banned from export to Russia since the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 while this year's crackdown was targeted at militarily useful electronics.

Yet Rusi indicated that Russia’s defence industry has built up secret stockpiles of vital components to try and beat the sanctions.

Joe Byrne a research fellow said that missile engineers have been combing the world in search of “specific microelectronics for specific systems” vital for Russian weapon systems. The most advanced British US and Japanese components are of special interest because of their high precision he said.

One of the components uncovered by Rusi researchers was a Nexperia-made bus transceiver which is a type of digital signal processing chip. The transceiver was embedded inside a BR-33 processor used as part of the Kh-101 cruise missile’s guidance system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQ3MGJmN2Q4LWNkMzItNDcyZC1iNzVmLTYwMTllYjRiMTAwYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The semiconductor boom: has the UK missed its chance?,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

In this second part some examples of integrated circuits (ICs) that are or can potentially be manufactured globally using 180 nm technology are discussed along with briefly market and revenue aspects.

In Part 1 of this series we examined the possibility of running the 8-inch (200 mm) fab line with 180 nm (0.18 micron) process node at India’s first fab (semiconductor fabrication plant) — Semi-conductor Laboratory (SCL) Mohali — at a higher capacity (close to 4000 wafers per month).

To get a feel for what are the “flavours” offered within 180 nm let us take a look at two charts — one from United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and the other from Tower Semiconductors both of which are among the top 10 foundries in the world.

Going by this classification  chips that fall under the 180 nm process node may predominantly fall into four categories — communication power management microcontrollers and sensors. (Note that some products may have a mix of these four categories.)

Note that the same tools that the SCL owns as mentioned in Part 1 are likely to be good enough to fabricate 130 nm chips too provided production-grade technology is obtained (usually through a 'transfer of technology').

Going by the same trend as with foundry 130/180 nm technology must be about 10 per cent or perhaps even more because many of the IDMs do not have the most advanced nodes. Of this nearly half of the revenue will be from 180 nm and the rest from 130 nm.

In 2021 the overall semiconductor market comprising foundry fabless (fabrication outsourced) and integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) was nearly $600 billion.

Given that many more foundries have the capability to process 130/180 nm nodes (compared to bleeding-edge process nodes like 7 nm and 5 nm) all the foundries together are likely to have about 10 per cent revenue from these two process nodes.

In Part 1 it was said that Tower Semiconductor had helped with the upgrade of SCL to 180 nm technology. However it is possible that not all the flavours were transferred as part of the transfer agreement then.

The “base technology” is the ability to process wafers (fabricate chips) using a particular process node and will cover some flavours. The cost and ease of adding capability will depend on which one and also on what kind of customers (or applications and products) the fab is targeting.

In other words after the technology transfer that happened around 2010-11 Tower Semiconductor and SCL may have developed additional flavours on their own in their respective fabs.

That is to say that not every example from the list (in the charts) that will follow may be doable right now at SCL but many are likely to be possible (or even already implemented on a small scale). Some of them may be doable with tweaks or additions to the production line.

Radio Frequency Front End Modules (RF FEM or just RFFE) are key devices in communication applications like mobile phones and other devices that receive and send signals.

The exact configuration of the RFFE modules may differ based on applications (5G RFID reader automotive etc) but components like RF switches low noise amplifiers (LNA) power amplifiers (PA) antenna tuners analog to digital converters (ADC) and digital to analog converters (ADC) are seen in many or all of these modules.

Here are some examples from within the past four to five years mentioning 180 nm technology — PA for 4G/5G  multiple examples of LNA for the global navigational satellite system (GNSS) examples of various LNAs for GPS PA and RF switch for health applications phase-change material switch driver PA for wireless combo chip antenna for bio-medical applications and soil moisture monitoring (check sizes) MIMO on chip antenna for 5G antenna design for millimetre and THz applications and so on.

Multiple examples can also be found for ADC and DAC using 180 nm. In fact the SCL already lists many on its website.

The global positioning system (GPS originally Navstar GPS) is a GNSS while India’s regional autonomous navigation system NaviC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) is said to be more suited to India’s needs.

COORDINATES an exclusive monthly magazine on positioning navigation and associated technologies and applications in its January 2022 edition gives the example of a chip fabricated using 180 nm at SCL for NaviC.

Further in power management ICs (PMICs) even as recently as March 2020 Tower Semiconductor has been offering new process design kits using 180 nm. Tower has a wide range of offering for manufacturing PMICs including for high voltage using 180 nm.

There are also examples from other fabs such as X-Fab. Interestingly these technologies offered are not “statis” either; both have enhanced their 180 nm offering recently. X-Fab added flash memory capability in April 2021 and Tower enhanced its BCD process in May 2022.

Industry website Semiconductor Engineering has estimated (November 2021) that PMIC shortages (made using process nodes ranging from 180 nm up to 40 nm technologies) would last well into 2022.

Earlier in an article titled 'Chip shortages grow at mature nodes' (July 2021) the website had mentioned shortages of microcontroller units (MCUs) that are fabricated using multiple process nodes (based on complexity) including 180 nm.

As per IC Insights the automotive MCU market is expected to have surged 23 per cent in 2021 despite the shortages as prices have been on the up.

Sensors could in general mean a variety of devices — for example the magnetic hall (effect) sensor air flow sensor temperature sensor all using 180 nm and so on.

It was reported in 2018 that Tower Semiconductor’s 0.18 um CMOS Image Sensor (CIS) SPAD (single-photon avalanche diode) process had been chosen by LeddarTech for its next-generation automotive LiDAR solutions combining CMOS image sensors and SPAD on the same chip.

Many more examples related to image sensors can be found. Yet another example is of a 128×128 image sensor having been built alongside an embedded convolutional neural network model with programmable weights on a 180 nm CMOS die.

Apart from the four main categories examined so far there are many other type of chips. For example implantable devices made using TSMC’s 180 nm (April 2022) the article in Scientific Reports about neural network chip using UMC’s 180 nm (May 2022) and non-volatile memory offerings such as given here. (A comprehensive list is beyond the scope of this article.)

Current Status And Outlook For 200 mm Fabs Worldwide

Here it is said that “200mm foundries have been operating at near 100% capacity for the last three to four years”. Within the next five years when the new capacity is still in the making some foundries with 180 nm capability may get more orders than what they can process and SCL may be able to grab some sub-contracts if appropriately positioned.

As per SEMI “200mm fab activity is strong very much alive and flexing its muscles”. In its April 2022 report Ajit Manocha (former CEO of GlobalFoundries and one of the 19 members of the advisory committee for India Semiconductor Mission) said “Wafer manufacturers will add 25 new 200mm lines over the five-year period to help meet growing demand for applications such as 5G automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) devices that rely on devices like analog power management and display driver integrated circuits (ICs) MOSFETs microcontroller units (MCUs) and sensors.""

There may be temporary downtrends such as the one recently triggered by worries of inflation and potential recession. But in the medium term (that is over the next four to five years) SCL’s 200 mm fab line can target to process 4000 wafers per month as proposed in Part 1.

This capacity should be good enough to make a large number of some or many types of chips both for domestic use and exports; indeed SCL will have to capture the orders.

How Many Chips And What Kind Of Revenue?

If the chip (die) size is known the number of dies per wafer can be calculated.

In this chip gallery pictured are many chips using 180 nm. If we take the size of the “2.5-3.2GHz CMOS differentially-controlled continuously-tuned varactor-less LC-VCO in 180nm CMOS” (0.7mm X 0.7mm) we get more than 45000 dies per wafer.

Each die is cut out and packaged as an individual chip — SCL is known to have packaging capability as well.

The revenue generated if all wafers are done in the foundry mode will depend on the sale price per wafer. As per a 2018 estimate each processed 180 nm wafer can be sold at $625. Given the increasing demand the base price may be higher now and special purpose wafers may cost even more.

Going by the $625 per wafer price 4000 WPM (48000 wafers per year) leads to a revenue of $30 million — approximately Rs 225 crore. There is also the MEMS line that can do an additional 2000 WPM.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYWRnZXRzbm93LmNvbS9zbGlkZXNob3dzL3R3aXR0ZXItYWRvYmUtZ29vZ2xlLWFuZC0xMy1vdGhlci10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWNvbXBhbmllcy1oZWFkZWQtYnktaW5kaWFuLW9yaWdpbi1jZW9zL3Bob3RvbGlzdC84ODAwODc1MC5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FkZ2V0c25vdy5jb20vYW1wL3NsaWRlc2hvd3MvdHdpdHRlci1hZG9iZS1nb29nbGUtYW5kLTEzLW90aGVyLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktY29tcGFuaWVzLWhlYWRlZC1ieS1pbmRpYW4tb3JpZ2luLWNlb3MvcGhvdG9saXN0Lzg4MDA4NzUwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Google and 16 other technology giants headed by Indian-origin executives,"Microsoft Google and 16 other technology giants headed by Indian-origin executives

The country’s competition regulator may launch proceedings under Section 19a of the German Competition Act POLITICO reported Thursday (Aug. 11) citing two people who are close to the matter and adding that Google Meta and Amazon have already been determined to be subject to the rules. Apple also is being considered for examination.

Under the act which went into effect in January 2021 Germany can move fast to prohibit conduct that is anti-competitive such as self-preferencing and pre-installation of services per the report.

To be subject to the rules companies must be found to have “paramount significance for competition across markets” according to the report.

Elsewhere in Europe Microsoft’s deal to buy Activision Blizzard is being looked into by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority Reuters reported in July.

“We’re committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence and that it will be positive for competition” said Lisa Tanzi corporate vice president and general counsel of Microsoft according to the Reuters report.

In addition Italian cloud provider Aruba SpA and several Denmark-based cloud providers filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Union’s antitrust watchdog in April charging Microsoft with undermining its competition and limiting consumers’ computing services choices Bloomberg reported April 13.

I'm a folder-emptier.

I don't like little red circles on my iPhone and I never leave an unread email in my Hotmail inbox.

Lately though more and more strange things have been appearing.

Junky phishy evil-minded emails trying to bait me into submission.

This led me to pay extra attention to my junk mail -- largely because ironically legitimate emails sometimes end up there.

But let's focus on the phishy and the evil-minded that appear in both my junk mail and my inbox. Sometimes they're the very same emails one day after another.

Often misspelled and written in strange typefaces they sometimes even claim they're from oh Microsoft.

But I've been noticing some disturbing and changing patterns.

My Company Is Taking The Trouble To Help You.



One was the increasing plethora of junk that creeps into my inbox from apparently real companies. ADT Security LeafFilter HelloFresh Sono Bello Body Contouring (""One Day Fat Removal"") and American Home Warranty are names that seem to waft in daily.

And what messages. From the alleged American Home Warranty: ""Will take the trouble of repairing your house -- info here!""

You'll take the trouble? How kind. But when there's an exclamation point you've lost me fake or not.

I've never had dealings with any of these companies. No not even for body contouring. Yet here they are always the same companies. Why?

Of course there are still the more typical supposedly personal attempts to offer me money. Even these now creep through to my inbox more often.

Sample headline from Noemie Raphael: ""My support."" Her message began: ""Hello I'm Mrs. Noemie Ethan Raphael married to the late Mr. Ethan Raphael who was a businessman and a politician here. Before he passed on we deposited the sum of $4.6 million dollars in one of the leading banks here.""

Equally ludicrous but relatively new to me -- were the emails from Kristalina of the International Monetary Fund offering me a grant and from Christopher A. Wray -- a familiar name.

The latter offered a double bluff: ""After proper and several investigations by the Western Union Money Gram International Monetary Fund (IMF) and United Nations (UN) Offices we found your name amongst those that have sent money through Western Union Cash App Zelle Venmo Bank Transfer/Deposit and Money Gram in the course of receiving your Inheritance Lottery United Nation [sic] compensation funds which proves that you have truly been swindled by those unscrupulous persons by sending money to them through the above mentioned means.""

Swindled eh? Truly?

They're still doing it and this one is so blessedly all-encompassing. It must still be fooling somebody.

My Business Would Like To Do Business With Your Business.



Recently though a new trope has appeared. New to me at least.

This has a more insidious subject line strategy. It purports to be from a company that wants to buy my products or from which I've supposedly bought products.

""New Order"" is one frequent headline. Or even ""Invoice Enclosed.""

You may think you could easily spot these.

I can imagine that these sorts of despicable things might tempt small business owners who are harassed stressed by inflation and managing on a bare minimum of staff.

One careless eye one inattentive moment and the small business owner or their lone inexperienced assistant might just get caught up in the promise of more revenue from some far-off place.

The problem now is that sometimes even these emails are now appearing in my inbox and no matter how many times I mark them as phishing still they come. (While emails from PR companies most often appear in junk.)

We Try But We Can't Stop It.



Email is by its very nature a medium that constantly assaults your attention so it's easy to open such emails automatically and even respond to them without sufficient thought.

I did it once many years ago -- I clicked on the link even. I was very very lucky that it seemed to cause no subsequent damage.

I asked Microsoft why the company is still unable to make sure that all this sort of stuff goes straight to junk. Especially as more and more of it now appears in my regular inbox.

A company spokesman explained that you can customize your junk folder. You can more aggressively filter your junk mail -- the default is set for ""No Automatic Filtering.""

Ultimately though defeat always lurks even in your inbox.

Microsoft's spokesperson explained: ""Like all email services Hotmail and Outlook (for both consumer or commercial work accounts) have spam filters to block unsolicited spam email. They can block a lot of spam but can't block it all as spammers are continuously changing tactics.""

It's a touch disspiriting that the scammers are somehow more adept than Microsoft's finest talents.

The lay person might be reasonable in asking one question.

If tech companies have now become so adept at stalking us and knowing our every word and movement why is it still hard for them to completely throttle scammy emails?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdoYWNrcy5uZXQvMjAyMi8wOC8xMy9ydWZ1cy1taWNyb3NvZnQtaXMtYmxvY2tpbmctd2luZG93cy1pc28tZG93bmxvYWRzL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdoYWNrcy5uZXQvMjAyMi8wOC8xMy9ydWZ1cy1taWNyb3NvZnQtaXMtYmxvY2tpbmctd2luZG93cy1pc28tZG93bmxvYWRzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rufus: Microsoft is blocking Windows ISO downloads,"It appears that Microsoft has started to block Windows ISO downloads that originate from Rufus. Rufus is a popular open source tool to create bootable media.

ADVERTISEMENT

Update: The developers have found a way around the block and released an update. Rufus can once again download ISO images from Microsoft. End

Options to download Windows ISO images was introduced in Rufus 3.5 which the developer released in 2019. The ability to download Windows 8 Windows 10 and Windows 11 ISO images was a welcome feature addition as it made the process of creating Windows boot media more comfortable.

The developer has added more features to Rufus in the meantime that improved the program for some Windows administrators and users significantly. Options to bypass Windows 11 system requirements during Inplace upgrades and to create local accounts instead of Microsoft accounts and to deny privacy questions outright were added in 2022.

Downloads are powered by the Fido script in Rufus and this worked fine ever since the functionality was introduced. The script pulled download information from Microsoft servers and downloads were provided by Microsoft.

Now Rufus users are receiving error messages on attempts to download Windows 8 10 or 11 using Rufus.

The current error message is displayed after selecting an operating system version in the downloader. It states:

Error: Download of Windows ISOs is no longer available due to Microsoft having altered their website to prevent it.

Windows 7 ISO downloads are still supported and work just like before. It is unclear why Microsoft is not blocking Windows 7 downloads as well.

Microsoft is still offering Windows ISO image downloads from its own website. A visit to the Windows 11 Download page on the Microsoft website continues to provide users with ISO images when they request them.

A link to a thread on GitHub is provided where the matter is discussed. According to the information published there Microsoft made a deliberate change to prevent downloads from any other source than its own website.

The Fido 1.30 changelog confirms the change as well:

Disable Windows 8 ? Windows 11 ISO downloads

It appears that Microsoft purposefully made their download servers hostile to our script and trying to fix this is likely to take a long time...

The developer is asking for help to find a way around this limitation. While it is possible to download official ISO images from Microsoft downloads are limited to specific builds only.

With Rufus and Fido users could pick different versions for download. Another advantage was that the entire process was integrated in a single program.

Closing words

We contacted Microsoft to find out more about the issue but have not heard back yet.

Now You: have you used Rufus in the past? Why do you think is Microsoft blocking downloads?

Microsoft has just released a beta version that supports hand-writing via Scribe. This system allows you to insert and edit text in a Word document PowerPoint presentation or Excel spreadsheet using the Apple Pencil with handwriting automatically converted into typed text.

Apple Scribble works by recording what you’re writing on the screen with the Apple Pencil and then translates that into typed text that an app can read. Scribble was added in iPadOS 14 for any iPad that supports the original or second-generation Apple Pencil including any iPad Pro the third-generation iPad Air and newer the fifth-generation iPad mini and newer and the sixth-generation iPad and newer.

Microsoft will likely support the Scribble feature for most users in the coming weeks once all of the bugs have been worked out with the Insiders Build. This might be a very useful feature for many users. One of the use cases that I find interesting is when you are out of the office and don’t have the magic keyboard with you you can make a quick annotation or a quick change in a PowerPoint presentation right before you present it.

Rating Action:

Moody’s affirms PICC P&C's A1 IFSR; outlook stable

15 August 2022

Hong Kong August 15 2022 -- Moody’s Investors Service has affirmed the A1 insurance financial

strength rating (IFSR) of PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited (PICC P&C) and its a1

Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA).

The outlook on PICC P&C remains stable.

RATINGS RATIONALE

The affirmation of PICC P&C's A1 IFSR considers the company's a1 BCA and Moody’s expectation

of strong government support in times of need given the company’s effective ownership by the

Ministry of Finance and the Social Security Fund which is effectively an arm of the Chinese

government (A1 stable) and PICC P&C's status as the country's flagship property and casualty

(P&C) insurance company and a major financial institution in China. The rating also considers the

company’s moderate level of dependence on the Chinese government which exposes the company

to China's economic environment; and the moderate links between the credit profiles of PICC P&C

and the government.

The affirmation of PICC P&C's a1 BCA reflects the company’s outstanding market position with

huge underwriting capacity in China's P&C insurance sector its strong capitalization and its good

underwriting profitability with expense ratio that has been declining and lower than its domestic

peers.

Nevertheless most of PICC P&C's invested assets and business operations are in China. Moody's

typically constrains the BCA of an insurance company if its exposure to the sovereign and its related

risks rise to a level that would limit the insurer's ability to separate itself from a potential deterioration

of sovereign credit.

As China's largest P&C insurer PICC P&C has been able to maintain its dominant market position

and significant lead over its peers over the past few years. The company's government background

and substantial underwriting capacity give it a strong competitive advantage in conducting

businesses with large corporations and state-owned enterprises and leading the policy driven

business such as agricultural insurance and social medical insurance. Therefore it has a higher

portion of non-motor insurance premiums than its domestic peers and hence better product

diversification.

The company reported 3.8% growth of its gross written premiums in 2021 higher than industry

average of around 1%. The growth of its non-motor insurance lines (in particular accidental injury

and health insurance as well as agriculture insurance) offset the decline in motor premiums. PICC

Story continues

P&C’s absolute market share in 2021 was 32.8% by premium income ahead of China’s second-

largest insurer’s 19.7% share.

The company has maintained a solid and stable solvency ratio over the past few years. At the end

of March 2022 its comprehensive solvency ratio and core solvency ratio were 235% and 203%

respectively under the China Risk-Oriented Solvency System (C-ROSS) phase II well above the

minimum regulatory requirement. The company also uses capital supplementary bonds to support its

comprehensive solvency ratio.

However PICC P&C’s underwriting profitability weakened slightly in 2021 despite the company

recording a 7.2% increase in net profit. Its combined ratio increased to 99.6% in 2021 from 98.9%

in 2020 mainly driven by increased loss ratio resulting from higher claims from natural disasters as

well as reduced premium adequacy and expanded coverage of motor insurance as part of China’s

motor insurance pricing reform.

The company’s underwriting profitability will remain pressured by declining premium rates due to

intensified competition and tighter regulations as well as higher claims from inflation and more

frequent catastrophe events. Nevertheless while PICC P&C has significant catastrophe exposure to

natural disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons it has adequate reinsurance that lowers such

risk to manageable levels relative to its overall capitalization.

As the People's Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited’s (PICC Group) strongest subsidiary

PICC P&C may be called upon to support other group affiliates for strategic purposes or capital

needs through direct investments or upstream dividends.

The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that PICC P&C will maintain its strong position in

China's P&C insurance market strong capitalization and good underwriting profitability. In addition

Moody’s expects the level of government support for the company will remain largely stable.

Given that PICC P&C's a1 BCA is already at the same level as China's sovereign rating Moody's

has not incorporated any additional uplift in the company’s final IFSR. In addition most of PICC

P&C's business is in China and its key standalone credit fundamentals (asset quality capitalization

profitability and financial flexibility) are partly correlated with and therefore linked to China’s

economic and market conditions. The rating is therefore at the same level as China's A1 sovereign

rating.

FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS

An upgrade of PICC P&C's rating is unlikely because the rating is already at the same level as the

sovereign rating and PICC P&C's business is predominantly in China.

Nevertheless Moody’s could upgrade the rating if PICC P&C's overseas business contributes a

significant portion of the firm's revenue and earnings; and the company's invested assets become

more geographically diversified while it maintains solid and stable capitalization and profitability

with its Moody's-adjusted gross underwriting leverage consistently below 4x and its combined ratio

consistently below 95%.

Moody's could downgrade PICC P&C's rating if (1) the company's capital adequacy deteriorates

with its Moody's-adjusted gross underwriting leverage consistently above 5x or its comprehensive

solvency ratio falling below 180% on a sustained basis; (2) its shareholders' equity erodes by more

than 10% due to for example a major catastrophe or investment losses; (3) its combined ratio

remains consistently above 100%; (4) China's sovereign rating is downgraded given the company's

significant business and asset exposure to the Chinese economy.

On Wednesday the government released the latest consumer price index report which showed inflation hit 8.5 percent for the month of July - down from 9.1 percent in June.

On a monthly basis prices were unchanged from June to July - the smallest such rise for more than two years.

Falling gas prices were credited for last month's relative decline from June but this was driven partly by fewer Americans heading to the pumps or filling up less often.

Lisa Shalett chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management said it was 'a head fake' to believe that the worst was past.

'The idea that inflation may have peaked in our humble opinion may be correct directionally but may also be a little bit of a head fake with regard to this idea that hey game over problem solved the Fed has conquered the day and Fed credibility is back and all of that' she said speaking on Friday on Bloomberg's What Goes Up podcast.

Lisa Shalett chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management spoke on Thursday to the hosts of Bloomberg's What Goes Up podcast

She said that 'a lot of things have gone right' regarding global demand for energy slowing and supply chain issues easing which has helped bring down the soaring cost of food.

'But for the markets to be celebrating as they have been since the middle of June our guess is we're way premature for that.'

She said she expected Jerome Powell the chair of the Fed to be happy at Wednesday's data and said June's inflation of 9.1 percent appeared to be a peak. But she warned inflation was still excessively high.

'If I'm Jerome Powell I probably do have a smile on my face and I'm glad that energy prices went my way' she said.

'But let's get real here people.

'I mean 8.5 percent on your headline and a core that was really unchanged at close to 6 percent is nowhere near a sustainable level. It's three times your target of 2 percent.'

Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell is seen on July 27 in Washington DC

Falling gas prices (pictured) gave Americans a slight break from the pain of rocketing inflation last month though the surge in overall prices slowed only modestly from the four-decade high it reached in June

A lack of affordable options is driving down home sales in the US. The fastest drops in newly pending sales from May to June happened in San Jose (-24.3 per cent) Seattle (-23.9 per cent) and Salt Lake City (-20.8 per cent)

Shalett described the first six months of this year as a 'very very textbook bear market' noting that some of the sharpest drops were felt in the tech sector.

'Folks think the data's going to get more constructive and we get folks thinking that they're going to find some bargains and they go in and they find the bargains where things have sold off the most' she said.

'And some of the biggest damage as we know was in the unprofitable tech space some of the meme-stock space and some of the more core pieces of the Nasdaq and Faang. And so that's driven this hope that the worst is over.'

She added that there was more bad news to come.

'Folks who are true students of the market know that in every bear market we have these retracement rallies. They are head-fake rallies.'

U.S. Treasury yields dipped on Friday after a volatile week as investors evaluated whether an apparent slowdown in inflation increases could reduce the speed of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.

Data on Thursday showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in July. It came a day after news from the CPI for July.

The data has prompted some hopes that the worst of inflation increases may be in the rear view mirror. Still many analysts and investors say that more proof will be needed before it can be determined how Fed policy could be affected.

'The theme here is that if indeed the monthly inflation prints are a little more stable we'll need fewer rate hikes and then long-term inflation's unlikely to come down quite as far' said Guy LeBas chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

However LeBas echoed Shalett in emphasizing that it was too soon to celebrate.

'I would maintain skepticism until we at least see one or two more inflation prints that signal that rate hikes are ready to slow' LeBas said.

Low liquidity has also added to market volatility with many traders out for summer holidays and as some investors are wary to take positions until there is more clarity on the outlook.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2NvbGxlZ2UvdXcvMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9naW8tcGFlei13b3JraW5nLWludG8td2lzY29uc2luLWZvb3RiYWxsLXRlYW1zLTItZGVlcC1ub3NlLXRhY2tsZS8xMDMxMzU1MzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gio Paez working into Wisconsin football team's 2-deep at nose tackle,"No commitment required.

Sandy Kreisberg founder of HBSGuru.com and a leading MBA admissions counselor thinks he knows why. It’s that damn standardized test. Yobou is sitting on a GRE score of 312 with a 50th percentile quant score and an 89th percentile verbal score.

His tough love advice: Retake the test again and again. “If you can get an 80 percentile on both sides of the GRE it will change your story entirely” advises Kreisberg in this episode of Friday’s With Sandy. “When schools see a 50th percentile quant score they start wondering if you can do the work. There will rarely be a point in your life when one stupid thing can have such meaning. Bite the bullet man. Take the GRE as many times as you can. It can change your life.”

It’s hard to imagine that a simple test can get in the way of such a viable MBA candidate. TK has a 3.8 in accounting from Quinnipiac University in Connecticut and a 3.8 from Bentley University just outside Boston on his master’s degree in the same field. He is the head of planning and analysis for a network of schools that help to prepare students in West Africa for the rigors of a university education abroad. The organization works with 3000 students and has annual revenue of about $11 million.

Yobou is articulate and personable has an undeniable professional presence and would bring diverse perspectives into an MBA classroom given his roots in the Ivory Coast in West Africa. He wants to use an MBA to transition into either investment banking or consulting.

This year he is re-applying to all three schools that turned him down a year ago and also targeting two Canadian MBA programs: The Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto and the Desautels Faculty of Management at McGill University in Montreal.

Watch Sandy’s analysis of his chances and his advice on how Yobou can improve his chances of admission this time around.

FirstNet users can use numerous different push-to-talk (PTT) applications that leverage the connectivity provided by the nationwide public-safety broadband network (NPSBN) but FirstNet PTT—developed by Samsung—is designed to meet the 3GPP standard for mission-critical services (MCX) according to Robert Fowler AT&T’s product-management specialist for FirstNet LTE mission-critical services (pictured above on the left with Mike Newburn).

“The solution is a high-prioritized solution on the network” Fowler said during the APCO presentation. “One of the key differences between FirstNet Push to Talk and any application you might download off of Google Play or off of iTunes is that this is really a core network service—it is not an application. It is part of the LTE network fully integrated with an enhanced packet core.

“So it’s not an external entity that’s connected to the FirstNet network. It’s an integral part of the FirstNet solution. Therefore we can prioritize the service moreso than you can any standard over-the-top application. It delivers on the 3GPP promise of a low-latency high-performing audio-quality service and you’ll note that if you test the service out yourself.”

Indeed those who have tested FirstNet PTT overwhelmingly have applauded the performance and audio-quality aspects of the push-to-talk offering since it was introduced in March 2019. However relatively few have indicated that they would use FirstNet PTT in large part because the MCPTT offering did not allow interoperable communications with LMR radio systems.

But that situation appears to be changing rapidly. Today FirstNet PTT interoperability can be provided with a radio-over-IP (RoIP) solution and AT&T is testing a FirstNet solution developed by Catalyst that uses standards included in Release 12 of the 3GPP standard for LTE.

In addition interoperability using the interworking function (IWF)—the LMR-LTE interoperability technology included in Release 17 of the 3GPP standard—will be introduced later this year according to Fowler.

“IWF is part of the MCX infrastructure so each of the solutions has a different approach” he said. “Down the FirstNet PTT approach we’re using Samsung and Etherstack core software. So ISSI guys—with a premier network-infrastructure player—are building IWF.

“We’re going to go to controlled introduction this year. We’re excited about it.”

Other vendors are developing IWF solutions or others that are functionally similar but Fowler said that the FirstNet PTT deployment of the Samsung-Etherstack technology could be the first IWF deployment in the world on a large-scale basis.

“As far as I know this will be the first actual deployment of one. I have not seen any press on anyone saying that they’ve done it—even with TETRA which is where you would expect something to happen but it didn’t. We’re really excited about doing it.”

FirstNet also is in the process of deploying eMBMS—the 3GPP technology that supports broadcast communications including one-to-many PTT calls Fowler said.

“We haven’t announced broadly the availability [of eMBMS] … We’re still working through some of the technical aspects of it but we have it in test cities” Fowler said.

“We have deployed it in 20 cities and we’re testing it out with the PTT service.”

Fowler noted that deploying eMBMS broadly in the network is not the only challenge to making the technology useful; eMBMS also requires support from the user device which will display when eMBMS is being used. And eMBMS will not be used for all PTT calls—current unicast systems are adequate in most situations so eMBMS will be invoked into service only when needed to relieve traffic on the FirstNet system he said.

“The times when eMBMS is most useful is when you have a concentration of users coming into a service area which is the way public safety responds” Fowler said. “When they come together you’ll have to start slicing off a network piece—that’s what eMBMS does—so that everyone has access.

“You use up less resources [with eMBMS] and it’s more efficient. You don’t have to worry about crowding out the cell infrastructure and so on.”

AT&T officials stated early this year that they hoped to make FirstNet PTT operationally practical on iPhones and other devices that utilize the iOS operating system from Apple. No Apple devices feature a dedicated push-to-talk button and one iOS release proved problematic for PTT applications.

“Some of the things that they did to their application prevented push-to-talk applications from coming to the foreground taking over the speaker and behaving like a PTT app” Fowler said.

Recently Apple released a “framework” that was expected to address some of the PTT issues. The Apple framework proposal is a “first step” but “it doesn’t really deliver a lot of functional” according to Fowler.

“It looks like [Apple iOS developers are] trying to improve the notification mechanisms within iOS to help support push to talk but it assumes that PTT is a black box and that we don’t need anything else from them which is not the case at all” he said. “We need a lot more. We would like a lot more support from their OS to deliver an improved user experience and we’re conveying that back to them.

“We reviewed their beta documentation and now we’re sending them back [responses. We’re saying] ‘Here’s our comments on that. You’re making a step in the right direction but here’s what we really need.’”

Fowler described the work with Apple in the PTT realm as “evolving” which also may be an accurate description of FirstNet PTT’s place in the push-to-talk marketplace. Fowler declined to say how many users subscribe to FirstNet PTT today but noted that the service is “in the adoption phase” at the moment.

All statements during Fowler’s presentation at the APCO 2022 event referred to the FirstNet PTT service developed by Samsung. FirstNet users also have the option of using another MCPTT-platform service—the Rapid Response offering from Motorola Solutions that was developed with the carrier-integrated software purchased from Kodiak as its foundation.

“This is a parallel product” Fowler said. “FirstNet is offering different PTT solutions because there are differences in their deployment and in their user experience. FirstNet Rapid Response leverage our relationship with Motorola that we’ve had on Enhanced Push to Talk which started as an enterprise solution but is available to FirstNet [users] as well.

“It’s the evolution of the Motorola product toward all of the MCX capabilities. So it’s a sister solution.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

(NASDAQ:NGM) Analysts Have Been Trimming Their Sales Forecasts,"One thing we could say about the analysts on NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:NGM) - they aren't optimistic having just made a major negative revision to their near-term (statutory) forecasts for the organization. Revenue estimates were cut sharply as the analysts signalled a weaker outlook - perhaps a sign that investors should temper their expectations as well. At US$17.09 shares are up 5.8% in the past 7 days. Investors could be forgiven for changing their mind on the business following the downgrade; but it's not clear if the revised forecasts will lead to selling activity.

After the downgrade the consensus from NGM Biopharmaceuticals' six analysts is for revenues of US$44m in 2022 which would reflect a stressful 37% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Losses are supposed to balloon 35% to US$2.27 per share. However before this estimates update the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$49m and US$2.19 per share in losses. Ergo there's been a clear change in sentiment with the analysts administering a notable cut to this year's revenue estimates while at the same time increasing their loss per share forecasts.

Check out our latest analysis for NGM Biopharmaceuticals

Looking at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. One more thing stood out to us about these estimates and it's the idea that NGM Biopharmaceuticals' decline is expected to accelerate with revenues forecast to fall at an annualised rate of 60% to the end of 2022. This tops off a historical decline of 18% a year over the past three years. Compare this against analyst estimates for companies in the broader industry which suggest that revenues (in aggregate) are expected to grow 3.5% annually. So it's pretty clear that while it does have declining revenues the analysts also expect NGM Biopharmaceuticals to suffer worse than the wider industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that analysts increased their loss per share estimates for this year. Unfortunately analysts also downgraded their revenue estimates and industry data suggests that NGM Biopharmaceuticals' revenues are expected to grow slower than the wider market. Given the stark change in sentiment we'd understand if investors became more cautious on NGM Biopharmaceuticals after today.

After a downgrade like this it's pretty clear that previous forecasts were too optimistic.

George Soros’s investment firm bolstered its stakes in Amazon.com Inc. Salesforce Inc. and Alphabet Inc. among other large technology companies. All three rank among its top 10 holdings as of the end of June according to a regulatory filing Friday.

The New York-based firm also added a new $20 million position in Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. though that represents only about 0.4% of Soros’s $4.6 billion US equities portfolio which fell $664 million in the second quarter. Other new additions included $168 million of Alleghany Corp. stock and $201.5 million in shares of American Campus which Blackstone Inc. agreed to buy in April.

Tech stocks have surged since entering a bear market earlier this year with the Nasdaq 100 up more than 20% from its low set in mid-June. US stocks advanced for the fourth-straight week the longest streak of weekly gains since November.

The billionaire philanthropist’s investment firm managed more than $28 billion as of the start of 2022 including public and private equity. Soros 92 has used his fortune to fund groups promoting justice democracy human rights and progressive politics through his Open Society Foundations.

He’s poured billions into his philanthropic efforts and most of his firm’s assets now belong to the foundations rather than the Soros family. His personal wealth is estimated at $8.5 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

With 220 million paying subscribers Netflix (NFLX -0.20%) is still the streamer to beat but after reporting two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses its stock price has significantly underperformed the competition.

If you're interested in buying streaming stocks but want to learn about alternatives to Netflix you're in the right place. Three Motley Fool contributors explain why Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD 1.37%) Paramount Global (PARA -0.23%) (PARA.A -2.66%) and Walt Disney (DIS -0.01%) could be in a great position to benefit from the streaming battle unfolding right now.

This newly merged company has a massive content library

Jennifer Saibil (Warner Bros. Discovery): The streaming wars have intensified and this spinoff from AT&T is well positioned to capture market share and grow its business.

So far it's not off to a great start. It was born with a load of debt after the April spinoff that merged Warner Bros. and Discovery and as inflation has hit Americans' pockets it posted a slight year-over-year revenue decrease in the second quarter. The net loss was $3.4 million. It will continue to absorb restructuring costs in the near future as it manages the financials of a large merger.

But there are many reasons to believe it has a bright future most obviously in the form of its huge media library. Warner Bros. Discovery operates a wide range of media networks most of which have been up and running for decades. Some examples are HBO CNN and the Discovery Channel which are all still important assets.

It also owns Warner Bros. Studios which produces franchises including the Harry Potter films and the DC Comics brand. The vast content library already gives the company an edge when competing against Netflix or any other streaming company and brings it straight into streaming's major leagues.

Streaming accounts for only a fairly small portion of the total business. Direct-to-consumer revenue was $2.2 billion in the 2022 second quarter or slightly less than a quarter of the company's total revenue of $9.8 billion. That's a benefit since Warner Bros. Discovery has other resources and revenue generators instead of putting all of its eggs in one basket.

But with 92 million customers for all of its streaming services it offers strong competition for Netflix even if it won't take the mantle of top streaming company in the near future. And while the company's total revenue decreased streaming revenue increased 4% year over year.

Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders might be in for a wild ride as the company charts a path forward but the potential is there. And with shares trading at a cheap price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 1.21 and dirt cheap price-to-sales ratio of only 0.77 this stock has a lot to offer investors.

The complete entertainment package

John Ballard (Paramount Global): Netflix has attributed its recent losses in subscribers to account sharing macroeconomic factors and competition. TV networks were slow to migrate over to digital platforms which gave Netflix a free pass to win subscribers. That has all changed over the last few years.

Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS) has posted impressive growth this year. The company rebranded its CBS All Access streaming service as Paramount+ and it's been growing rapidly. Global streaming subscribers including Pluto TV nearly doubled to 56 million in 2021 and has continued that streak through the first half of 2022.

The combination of news live sports and entertainment in one package appears to be a winning ticket in the streaming market right now. Paramount+ added another 4.9 million subscribers in the second quarter. It is clearly taking share away from Netflix which has reported two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses.

More choice is clearly playing a factor in limiting Netflix's growth right now. It's not over for the company however. Netflix still has the most subscribers if you exclude Disney's Hulu and ESPN+ subscribers. But it's going to need to make some adjustments to keep up with competing media companies and that's easier said than done.

Paramount is executing a successful strategy of leveraging entertainment properties across theatrical releases TV media and streaming to grow its audience. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.6 providing investors more value than Netflix's forward P/E of 23.7. Investors are getting a lot more growth for less than half the price.

Disney is more than challenging Netflix

Parkev Tatevosian (Disney): While Netflix undeniably deserves credit for pioneering the streaming-content industry The Walt Disney Company is quickly catching up. The House of Mouse exploded on the scene in November 2019 when it launched its flagship service Disney+. That's one of its three streaming services with the others being Hulu and ESPN+. Altogether Disney's bundle of three services had 221 million streaming subscribers as of July 2 which slightly eclipsed Netflix's 220 million and change.

Management updated its subscriber target aiming for 230 million at the midpoint by 2024. Unlike Netflix which started from scratch Disney had a robust library of content it could shift to its streaming platforms.

It is home to popular properties like Star Wars Marvel Pixar Mickey Mouse and friends and more. A film or series based on any of the aforementioned group is more likely to attract viewers because of their history.

In its most recent quarter which ended on July 2 Disney's streaming segment generated $5 billion in revenue a 19% increase from the prior year. That's a faster growth rate than Netflix which expanded revenue by 8.6% in its most recent quarter. Still Netflix earned an operating income of $1.6 billion while Disney lost $1 billion in its streaming segment.

Netflix remains the undisputed leader in the streaming industry when measured by the crucial metrics of revenue and subscribers. But as highlighted above Disney's three services surpassed the pioneer in overall subscribers. Investors who want to capitalize on this secular trend could do well by adding Disney's stock to their portfolios.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uc3RhZ2VibG9nLmNvbS9vbnNjcmVlbmJsb2cvMjAyMi84LzE0L29uc2NyZWVuLXJldmlldy0xMy10aGUtbXVzaWNhbC1vbi1uZXRmbGl40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OnScreen Review: “13: The Musical” on Netflix — OnStage Blog,"by Noah Golden Contributing Critic

Even though the musical comedy ""13"" only lasted 105 performances on Broadway in ‘08/'09 it launched a handful of theatrical careers (Allie Trimm Elizbeth Gillies Broadway musician Charlie Rosen and of yeah international pop star/future Galinda Ariana Grande) and has since become a staple on the community theater and high school circuit.

In many ways ""13"" is the perfect high school musical. It's easy to produce features a tuneful well-thought-out score that's head and shoulders above most generic teen musicals and it lets teenagers play teenagers. No stick-on beards or fake martinis accidents here thank God. It's a musical that celebrates that seemingly Herculean task of going from boy to man from child to teenager and does so with heart humor and introspection. This may be the most controversial statement I've ever made on this website but not just is ""13"" the 21st century's answer to ""Grease"" but the better version of ""Grease"" overall; better morals better-written characters and yes better songs too. It's the rare kids' musical that doesn't talk down to them treats their problems seriously and has something to teach them.

Now like ""Grease"" before it ""13"" has been made into a feature film directed by Tamra Davis that premiered Friday August 12th on Netflix. It's a fun jaunty adaptation but one that never quite gels as successfully as the original thanks in part to a muddled updating that feels like it tried to serve too many masters. Maybe it was studio noted in express or maybe the writers Robert Horn and Jason Robert Brown had trouble seeing the forest for the trees after working on this material for over a decade.

It's not so much a misfire as a missed opportunity. ""13"" doesn't find its true voice on screen the way ""In the Heights"" or the 2021 ""West Side Story"" did but it's also a far cry from the memorably misguided ""Dear Evan Hansen"" or ""Everybody's Talking About Jamie."" At its best ""13"" is joyful and fresh. At its worst it's generic and oddly limp - some killer Jason Robert Brown tunes inserted into a nicely filmed but forgettable Disney Channel Original Movie. Then again the ""High School Musical"" franchise – which the much-better ""13"" owes a debt – made millions and had a huge if not short cultural impact. So maybe that's less of a diss than it sounds.

Both the ""13"" stage musical and film follow Evan Goldman a newly teenaged New York Jew whose life in the Big Apple is shaken up when his parents split and he's forced to move to his grandma's house in Nowheresville Indiana just months before his Bar Mitzvah. With a big party to plan that could launch his social life in Indiana Evan must choose who his friends really are and find out what becoming a man means.

What works the best in this adaptation is the fresh-faced energetic cast and not surprisingly the music. Eli Golden (no relation I swear) has charisma for days as Evan Gabriella Uhl is just delightful as the quirky Patrice and Frankie McNellis makes a meal out of the cheerleading number ""Opportunity."" JD McCreary (as Brett) and Lindsey Blackwell (as Kendra) are terrific in ""I've Been Waiting"" a new ""Summer Loving""-like song while Ramon Reed leads the football players in a buoyant ""Bad Bad News."" They all have clear strong voices and natural comedy timing but most importantly they feel like real eighth graders. Not surprising given Brown's resume (""The Last Five Years"" ""Parade"" ""Mr. Saturday Night"") the songs of ""13"" are easy to listen to but challenging to perform well. The kids all pass that test with flying colors and do justice to Brown's score.

""The Lamest Place In The World"" remains a highlight as does the earworm title song. Although the orchestrations have been given a funkier make-over it never feels arbitrary or needlessly modern. While the score of ""13"" could feel out of touch I guess (it doesn't try to sound like music the average 13-year-old is streaming on Spotify) it's emotionally honest and fun without giving itself an instant expiration date. The entire film does this too – except for iPhones and a Zoom call the lives of these teenagers are weirdly bereft of technology or social media which may ring false but does keep the whole thing from being instantly dated ala ""Black Panther"" referencing the flash in the pan ""what are those"" meme.

While Brown retains most of the Broadway score he adds some new numbers and cuts others. ""The Bloodmaster"" covers similar territory to the stage show's ""All Hail The Brain"" but does so with a funky bass line and horns instead of a Harold Hill patter. I missed ""What It Means To Be A Friend"" ""Being A Geek"" and ""It Can't Be True"" while agreeing that their purpose is less necessary on screen. What doesn’t work is leaving the ""I'm becoming a man"" theme and ""If That's What It Is"" out of the conversation. Those musical themes track Ethan's progress from a self-centered kid to a maturing teen and the film feels rudderless without the lessons embedded in each. The screenplay doles out life lessons from Mom and Grandma (Debra Messing and Rhea Pearlman fine but overused) for Evan throughout rather than him learning them organically himself which erases some of his agency. The lessons too shift to more generic platitudes rather than the musical's more complex ideas on the fleeting nature of childhood and how the things we learn there transfer to adulthood.

Just as Robert Horn's screenplay struggles to find a place for the adults in Evan's life that were absent on stage he also has mixed results in updating the show's sensibilities. The impulses are almost always good yet reverberate in counterintuitive ways. For instance the cast of ""13"" is terrifically diverse in every way from race to body type. The Jewish characters are all (thankfully) played by Jewish actors; the wheelchair-user Archie is played by a real wheelchair-user. But Evan's complaint about moving to a hick Podunk town that Patrice calls the ""Lamest Place In The World"" doesn't hit very hard when the modern high school's student body is more diverse than a college admissions brochure. They have Black Latinx Asian and Muslim students but no one has heard of a Bar Mitzvah?

While the stage musical freely indulged in high school tropes – the jock bully the dumb popular blonde the scheming mean girl the lovable nerd the horny lothario – that's almost all sanded down here. The goal I think was to make the characters more two-dimensional and to avoid harmful stereotypes but it robs a lot of the cast of any defining traits (and lowers a lot of the stakes). Cutting the funny but skeevy ""Hey Kendra"" makes sense as well as refocusing Kendra/Brett/Lucy's quest to be about getting their first kiss rather than getting ""the tongue."" But other jokes scenes and songs from the original are overly sanitized and cautious.

The biggest victim of this is Archie a character from the musical who has muscular dystrophy. Archie is nerdy but confident. He lusts for out-of-his-league Kendra and uses his disability to get away with mischief. He's a great representation of disability onstage a kid who approaches his challenges with humor and positivity. Here he's relegated to the background. He's in a wheelchair but there's no mention of his disability or how it affects him. He gets no arc no song and no real defining traits. Perhaps the studio balked at Archie's original material (including a hilarious number that starts with ""No One Says No To A Boy With A Terminal Illness""). Still there's a difference between a bully making distasteful jokes and a kid winkingly reframing his own lot in life. One is offensive and out of touch; the other gives the character agency and personality. It's just a shame.

Truth is I can't quite uncouple my thoughts on ""13"" the movie with my admiration for ""13"" the musical nor am I the film's target audience (which seems a good five years younger than the stage version). I need to watch it again without noting all the changes and view it on its own merit. All I can tell you is that it's fast-paced and fun and worth a watch even if it fails to fully live up to the source material.

Years ago I wrote a piece for Onstage about taking my preteen and teenage cousins to see ""Wicked"" on Broadway. The show was slack and underwhelming but afterward my out-of-town 16-year-old cousin bought tickets with his own money to see ""Les Misérables” the next night. ""If 'Wicked' led to seeing 'Les Misérables'"" I wrote ""maybe 'Les Misérables' will lead to the work of Tom Kitt or Lin-Manuel Miranda or Jason Robert Brown or Duncan Sheik or Adam Guettel. If so then who am I to complain?"" I feel that way here. If you know a young aspiring performer who loves ""Descendants"" or ""High School Musical"" show them ""13."" They'll enjoy it and it can open a whole world of possibilities for them. Might I even suggest a double feature with ""Better Nate Than Ever?""

“13: The Musical” is streaming now on Netflix.

Turning your own to-do list into an enthusiastic filmic moment is a hard ask in this uneditable reality but I've come up with my own cinematic technique for running up that hill and getting shit done: Netflix soundtracks.

From the Kate Bush life-saver from Stranger Things to the John Hughes-channelling dreampop of the To All the Boys... series and the swinging '60s vibes of The Queen's Gambit Netflix soundtracks might bring a little thematic coherence to your day whether you're working at home need to stimulate your brain want to expand your music knowledge or just want to dance around a little in between tasks or cries.

For the record I've left musicals music films or music documentaries out of this list (that's way too easy and would read ""just play the Crazy Ex-Girlfriend soundtrack all the time"") but if you're really looking for these make a start with the excellent film The Forty-Year-Old Version. And everything on this list is a Netflix series or film to avoid picks not being available in different countries.

Just for fun I've also included a big music moment for each just to celebrate the power a strategic song choice has (and to dredge up all that raw emotion again you're welcome).

You love the show or movie now stream the soundtrack.

One of the best soundtracks around. Credit: Netflix

If you're looking for the dreampop-drenched soundtrack of apparently all onscreen teen dreams Never Have I Ever (directed by Linda Mendoza and written by Mindy Kaling) provides. All three seasons of this show have strong soundtracks so plenty to love here. While our pal Devi Vishwakumar (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) navigates high school drudgery big-time crushes family matters and friend fallouts while attempting to bury her grief the show's soundtrack sits in wait to elevate the story's many butterfly-filled adolescent happenings (Cannons' ""Fire for You"" I'm looking at you in both Season 1 and 2).

Alongside Joseph Stephens’ playful '80s-inspired score and a heap of synth-pop from the likes of Selebrities Superhumanoids and Anna of the North the soundtrack also features multiple Bollywood songs and big club bangers — well mainly this is a shout-out to the moment when Paxton Hall-Yoshida slow-motion strolls into a room to the sound of Robyn's ""Dancing On My Own"" in Season 1.

Big song moment: A wild card in the show's smorgasbord of electro-pop the most unforgettable moment in Season 1 comes from U2's ""Beautiful Day."" You'll know.

Wouldn't you know it the music supervisor for ""Dear White People"" is a former KCRW radio DJ. Sam would approve. Credit: Netflix

Amid the rampant systemic racism on-campus at Winchester College sits one of Netflix's most superb soundtracks. Combined with composer Kris Bowers' stunning score the soundtrack for Dear White People is stocked with hundreds of songs across decades and genres — from '70s R&B to 2010s hip hop classical to bebop. Across the seasons sit tracks from Childish Gambino Noname Michael Kiwanuka Rapsody Shamir (who appears in the show too) A Tribe Called Quest Tkay Maidza Tyler the Creator BROCKHAMPTON DeJ Loaf Thelma Houston Moses Sumney J Dilla and so many more not to mention a copious amounts of Tchaikovsky. As well as scoring moments of college life — love sex heartbreak friendship loss episodes of Defamation — the show's music also fuels the narrative like the Future song that ignites a pivotal scene in Season 1.

Each episode's soundtrack has its own style depending on the featured character thanks to music supervisor and former KCRW radio DJ Morgan Rhodes. Rhodes told Variety the aim was to create a playlist for each student based on those creator Justin Simeon had made previously. ""Because the pervasive belief is that characters and their perspectives are nuanced and varied just like their experiences"" she said. ""And so in turn their music should be."" Bowers the publisher notes also wrote individual score themes for each character too.

And wrapping it all up the fourth and final season of the show was a '90s jukebox musical. Perfect.

Music can literally help you find your way out of The Upside Down. Credit: Netflix

Clearly if you're running a Netflix show involving teen romance and you don't have an '80s soundtrack are you even a show? The Duffer Brothers' Stranger Things at least gets to claim that it's set in the 1980s and you can hear it all through the soundtrack. The Cars The Police Duran Duran Toto The Psychedelic Furs Cyndi Lauper Joy Division Echo and the Bunnymen New Order — the Stranger Things soundtrack is a smorgasbord of ‘80s delights that find a new sinister tinge when side-by-side with the series' big-synth-energy original theme and score by SURVIVE's Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein.

Thanks to music supervisor Nora Felder songs have significant power within the narrative; Kate Bush's ""Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)"" was all anyone could talk about in Season 4 — apart from Metallica's ""Master of Puppets."" The Clash's ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" plays a pretty damn important role for the Byers family in Season 1. But others are gloriously non-diegetic like The Cars' ""Moving in Stereo"" in that pool scene in Season 3.

Big music moment: OK. So this was the ""Neverending Story"" scene from Season 2. But of course in one of the biggest music moments of Netflix soundtrack history? 🎶Be running up that road Be running up that hill... 🎶

Directed by Jeymes Samuel The Harder They Fall not only boasts an incredible cast — Jonathan Majors Idris Elba Regina King Zazie Beetz LaKeith Stanfield and Delroy Lindo — but one of the best soundtracks of all time. The film defiantly reclaims the Western even before the opening credits roll. A tale of heroes and villains the film follows Nat Love (Majors) on a quest for revenge against the formidable Rufus Buck (Elba). But he'll have to make his gunslinging way through ""Treacherous"" Trudy Smith (Regina King) and Cherokee Bill (Stanfield).*

The film also has an excellent original score composed by Samuel himself along with a huge soundtrack produced by the director and Jay Z — who also produced the film. There's standout tracks from Kid Cudi Fatoumata Diawara Ms. Lauryn Hill Edi Gathegi R.J. Cyler Koffee CeeLo Green Seal Laura Mvula Mayra Andrade and more.

Big music moment: Show me a better opener than ""Lightnin’ With The Blam Blams"" by R.J. Cyler and Edi Gathegi.

The ultimate '60s escapade. Credit: Netflix

If you managed to watch The Queen’s Gambit and not Shazam every song you must have been concentrating on the next move. A treasure trove of swinging '60s tunes the show's soundtrack complements every turtleneck checkered coat and mini-dress in Beth Harmon's enviable wardrobe.

While Carlos Rafael Rivera's compelling score tackles the big dramatic chess moments there are so many memorable '60s needle drops soundtracking Beth's story: cleaning an entire apartment to ""Along Comes Mary"" by The Association drinking PBRs to Shocking Blue's ""Venus"" putting up with the Apple Pis obsessing over The Vogues' ""You’re the One"" or engaging in speed chess set to Georgie Fame & The Blue Flames' ""Yeh Yeh."" Hot tip? If you're having a hard time getting stuff done throw on ""Tut Tut Tut Tut"" by Gillian Hills.

Whatever you thought of the film the ""Malcolm and Marie"" soundtrack rules. Credit: DOMINIC MILLER / NETFLIX

One of Netflix's most polarising films has an undebatable strength: an incredible soundtrack. From the very first notes of James Brown's ""Down and Out in New York City"" (from the 1973 Larry Cohen film Black Caesar) to the final frames over Outkast's ""Liberation"" the film's soundtrack almost acts as another character in Malcolm and Marie.

Zendaya (Marie) told Desus and Mero that a few songs — like William Bell's ""I Forgot to Be Your Lover"" — were written into the script by director Sam Levinson. ""Some of them Sam wrote in because they play into where the characters are emotionally whether that be Malcolm trying to apologise or Marie trying to talk to him"" she said. Others were selected by the film's editor Julio Perez IV — like jazz track ""Betaminus"" by Zoot Sims Jim Hall and Jimmy Raney which scores the making of mac and cheese.

But John David Washington (Malcolm) pitched the final Outkast track. ""Hearing what Malcolm was going through"" he said ""and being a frustrated artist and the relationship with the industry there's something about Erykah Badu's verse on that CeeLo's verse on that always resonates. I thought it was apropos for this story to end it like that.""

Big music moment: The timelessly romantic ""In a Sentimental Mood"" by Duke Ellington and John Coltrane which pops up in a rare Nice Moment. Savour it.

So much '80s on this list. Credit: Netflix

For some reason nothing sets a teen romance comedy more firmly in the present than an ‘80s inspired soundtrack. Combined with Oli Julian's classic teen movie score the awkward devastating and hilarious adolescent chapters of Sex Education come soundtracked by '80s hits from The The Salt-N-Pepa A Flock of Seagulls Sigue Sigue Sputnik a-ha Billy Idol The Smiths Talking Heads INXS The Cure Roxy Music and plenty more — including Lily's unsuccessful mood-setter ""Wild Thing"" by Tone-Loc. Meanwhile Ezra Furman adds poignancy to the series with plenty of sweet additions including newbies written for the show (you’ll spy a cameo in Season 1 with one of the best Eric-Otis moments ever). Sure you'll want to ride through the Welsh countryside with your best friend talking about masturbating all set to Furman's unofficial show anthem ""Love You So Bad"" — but for now home listening will have to do.

Big song moment: Aimee Gibbs surrounded by her friends on the bus to Sharon Van Etten's ""Seventeen."" An absolute show-stopper after a powerful storyline.

8. Top Boy

'Top Boy' features some of the UK's biggest music names in the cast and on the soundtrack including Little Simz. Credit: Ana Blumenkron / Netflix

Created by Ronan Bennett Top Boy goes back a decade with music at its very core — on screen with its cast behind the scenes with its producers and in its soundtrack. The original Channel 4 series (titled now as Top Boy: Summerhouse) centred around the fictional Summerhouse public housing estate in Hackney London and drug dealers Dushane and Sully (Ashley Walters AKA Asher D and Kane Robinson AKA Kano). Then Drake revived the show for Netflix and launched a new season in 2019.

The series has seen a who's who of the UK music scene appear in roles including Little Simz Dave Scorcher Sway Blakie and Bashy. It goes without saying then that Top Boy also features one of the best TV soundtracks around brimming with tracks by Burna Boy Jorja Smith Kojey Radical Central Cee and so many more.

Best music moment: The perfection of Lloyd Luther's ""Drugs on Tap"" in Season 3 episode 4 when Jamie's crew takes Cameron hostage.

Always and 4eva Credit: Netflix

If you're not a romantic you probably already hate this list with all the big-time mushy vibes around here. But I'm here to melt your cold jaded heart with LJ + PK and the delightfully loved-up soundtracks of the To All the Boys... series. Music supervisors Laura Webb and Lindsay Wolfington handpicked every song of the three films — and there are a lot of them with 47 songs in Always and Forever alone. Songs reappear in the films for sweet impact — for example ""I Like Me Better"" by Lauv plays as the bus leaves on the ski trip and heading to NYC (though remixed) and Anna of the North soundtracks both that spa scene in the first film and the bowling date in the third. The soundtracks meander through '80s-inspired (or actual '80s) electronic pop for that unmistakable John Hughes vibe big fun chart-toppers (cue the Covey sisters singing karaoke to Iggy Azalea's ""Fancy"") fierce K-pop nostalgic throwbacks and new romantic indie tunes. And of course this is a rom-com so Lara Jean and Peter need ""their song"" right? Well...

Big music moment: You knew I was going start sweetly wailing ""Beginning Middle End"" by Leah Nobel and Quinn Redmond first performed on an NYC rooftop by The Greeting Committee (who actually have three songs on the soundtrack) but not made iconic there.

So much has happened to the ""On My Block"" squad with so many tunes. Credit: Nicola Goode / Netflix

After everything we’ve been through the squad the soundtrack for On My Block will remind you of all the high school shenanigans first loves and crushes heartbreak and tragedy hardcore mystery-solving gang violence and general awkwardness of adolescence in Freeridge. This consistently Shazam-worthy soundtrack covers considerable ground with genres ranging from R&B neo-soul Latin hip hop low-key pop salsa electronic indie the lot — with both super famous and emerging artists. Alongside New York producer Kovas' superb score (and original song) scenes of young love breakups and family revelations land with tracks from Amir Obé Tattoo Money Raury Cherry Hill Billie Eilish Nao Brent Faiyaz and Alina Baraz fun party scenes are scored by Crooked Stilo and Daye Jack while RollerWorld/Lil' Ricky mystery-hunting escapades run with Sampha Rayana Jay and Little Simz among others. But nothing stops the show like Ruby and Jasmine performing their incredible Dillon Francis ""Look At That Butt"" routine that guilty viral pleasure ""Lunch Money"" or Rosé's ode ""Tricky Ricky."" Well there might be one song...

Big music moment: It's hard to forget DeJ Loaf's ""Changes"" and its connection with a certain quinceañera not to mention its terrible re-appearance in Season 2.

if you didn't love The Linda Lindas before ""Moxie"" you will after. Credit: Netflix

Starting a movement? You're gonna want some riot grrrl energy behind you. Amy Poehler's Moxie is brimming with feminist power anthems from artists across multiple genres with key zine scenes set to Bikini Kill's ""Double Dare Ya"" and TopLady's ""Green Light Red Light."" Vivian's (Hadley Johnson) shenanigans are inspired by her mum's (Poehler) activism and are scored to The Julie Ruin Tacocat Yuno Princess Nokia and great covers by Brandi Carlile and Lucy Dacus. But the feminist punk anthem above all Bikini Kill's ""Rebel Girl"" makes more than one appearance whether blasting from headphones or performed by Los Angeles band The Linda Lindas. Gotta say it though: Poehler wears a Sleater Kinney T-shirt and sneaks in a photograph of herself hanging with the band without any of their immortal tunes appearing in this film. I object.

If you've recently gone through a traumatic break-up it might be best to avoid this soundtrack — unless you have an immovable stallion heart. But if you need nay deserve a Big Cry get amongst this one. As Jenny Leah and Blair (Gina Rodriguez DeWanda Wise and Brittany Snow) gallivant around NYC throwing smoke mirrors and Lizzo's ""Truth Hurts"" in front of a raw break-up the Someone Great soundtrack blends escapist party bangers with heart punches (and liberal use of Phoebe Bridgers Sigrid Mitski and Frank Ocean's signature melancholia). Kicking off with Lorde's mighty break-up song ""Supercut"" the film wields music as bookends of a relationship — from cute flirty Vampire Weekend ""Mansard Roof"" beginnings to seeing each other post-break-up while Jessie Reyez performs the hell out of ""Great One.""

Big music moment: While I was going to pick the lovely bodega scene involving ""singing it out"" to Selena’s ""Dreaming of You"" I'll give this one to Phoebe Bridgers' ""Scott Street"" quietly rampaging all over the ""our spot"" moment in Washington Square Park. Those strings. Help.

Wait is that Ariana Grande scoring this ball? Taylor Swift scoring this Extra Horny Episode? As the cornucopia of debaucherous Regency-era shenanigans scampered onto Lady Whistledown's pages so did Bridgerton's soundtrack hasten into our awaiting ears.

Dear White People composer Kris Bowers continues the magic in Shonda Rhimes' outstandingly popular romance series teaming up with the Vitamin String Quartet and Duomo for the show's signature classical covers — from Billie Eilish's ""bad guy"" to Ariana Grande's ""thank u next Maroon 5's ""Girls Like You"" to Celeste's ""Strange."" Season 2 continued this train with covers of Madonna's ""Material Girl"" Rihanna's ""Diamonds"" Robyn's ""Dancing on my Own"" and a perfect use of Alanis Morrisette's ""You Outta Know.""

""A combination of a [distinct musical] palette and [distinct musical] themes really helped create a continuity through-line even as we were changing aspects of the genre or instrumentation"" Bowers told Mashable's Proma Khosla.

Big music moment: From Season 1? You know it's the ""Wildest Dreams"" scene. From Season 2? The excellent cover of popular Bollywood song ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"" while Edwina (Charithra Chandran) gets ready for her wedding.

Don't know what the song is ""She's Gotta Have It""? Spike Lee might drop an album cover for you. Credit: Netflix

Spike Lee's Netflix series inspired by his 1986 film may have been canned after two seasons but the She's Gotta Have It soundtrack will live on. Joining happily nonmonogamous protagonist Nola Darling (DeWanda Wise) in her daily experiences juggling sex dating friendship politics misogyny and making art in Brooklyn comes with one exceptional soundtrack — this is a Spike Lee joint after all. Alongside composer Bruce Hornsby's triumph of a score comes a playlist handpicked by Lee which weaves through jazz soul R&B reggaeton and many other genres and decades — not to mention that beautiful opening theme (Hornsby's expansion of the original film theme composed by Lee's father Bill) paired with photos from around Fort Greene where Lee grew up. And if you weren't sure of how pivotal music was to the series Lee splices in album covers for the song you just heard as a scene transition device. Handy.

Big music moment: It seems too easy but the montage of Nola's powerful street art ""My Name Isn't ____"" campaign (inspired by artist Tatyana Fazlalizadeh) set to Jill Scott's 2007 track ""Golden"" is a magnificent way to start the series.

If you need a pep-up channel your own character to join the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling and hit play on the GLOW soundtrack.

You'll want to make your own series main title sequence to Billy Joel's ""You May Be Right"" using escalators. But there's also plenty from the '50s '60s and '70s on here too. Pick your poison and get in the ring.

Big song moment: I've got a soft spot for Brittanica's GLOW rap — sorry ""speak-singing."" Knowing the British wrestler Rhonda is played by singer Kate Nash makes it even better.

Sweet birthday babyyyyy if you're enjoying the dreamy synth levels of this list of soundtracks check out the soundtrack to Russian Doll. Natasha Lyonne’s Groundhog Day-like mystery adventure is staged alongside French pop from Jacqueline Taïeb synth-pop from Light Asylum and '60s psychedelia from Mae West among plenty of other haunting songs. But of course the signature song from Season 1 is Harry Nilsson's ""Gotta Get Up"" played over and over again to signal each reset. Lyonne herself referred to the song as having a ""buoyant doomsday quality"" in a New York Times interview and eventually picked it over a few other options to ""touch something that was out of time and a New York and East Village that was out of time.""

Big music moment: No spoilers (because of the nature of this show) but the very final moments of the show are perfectly served with Love's 1967 track ""Alone Again Or.""

While Riverdale's doing its thing over there with ""Mad World"" moments The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina brings some witchy business to the town of Greendale. While Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) figures out how to be a teenage witch dealing with succubitches and regular high school student the show's soundtrack always makes a spooky connection often with '50s '60s and '70s rock and roll from Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Bad Moon Rising"" to ""Strange Magic"" by Electric Light Orchestra and Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man."" Plus there are some killer covers like ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Sylvia Gordon.

""Like the show itself the songs of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina are current vintage cutting edge and familiar (with a twist) and these elements create the musical character for the show"" said music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas (who also works on Riverdale and gave us the immortal soundtrack of The O.C.) in a press statement. These songs all bubble alongside composer Adam Taylor's haunted score which seems to deploy a ghostly theremin or sinister strings at every turn.

Big music moment: An early moment in Season 1 but Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett and the Crypt-Kicker's ""Monster Mash"" at Roz's Halloween party is such a vibe.

The Umbrella Academy and the adventures of the Hargreeves often involve big breakout needle drops and you've gotta love it. The Netflix series about a group of superpowered siblings often through time and space comes with one hell of a soundtrack alongside composer Jeff Russo's score. From the first introduction to the family to Tiffany's ""I Think We're Alone Now"" to a whole fight scene set to ""I Was Made for Lovin' You"" by KISS all the way to the end of the world soundtracked with Frank Sinatra's ""My Way"" these are music moments so deliberate and theatrical you'll need to take a breath after them.

Big music moment: I was going to go with Five fighting with his older self to ""Dancing With Myself"" but Season 3 kicking off with a big ol' dance battle to Kenny Loggins' ""Footloose""? Correct.

The Bulldogs made an official statement on Sunday afternoon confirming that the current Penrith Panthers assistant coach has been handed a five-year deal.

""The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs are pleased to announce that Cameron Ciraldo has been appointed as NRL Head Coach for five seasons commencing in 2023"" the statement read.



""As the club continues to build for long-term sustained success we are pleased Cameron shares the vision of ensuring our football programs are best-in-class.



""With respect to Cameron and the Penrith Panthers we will not be making any further comment until the end of the season.""

Reports from both News Corp and Nine mastheads originally broke the story with the 37-year-old reportedly informing his current club of his decision at training on Sunday.

Ciraldo's future has been widely speculated on this season with the in-demand coach declining a five-year offer from the Wests Tigers in June.

According to News Corp Ciraldo’s existing relationship with Bulldogs GM of football Phil Gould - who was previously GM at the Panthers - was a key factor in his decision.

A former Sharks Knights and Panthers player the Sydney-born coach was promoted to the role of assistant coach at Penrith in 2017.

He acted as caretaker coach for the club for six games in 2018 after the sacking of Anthony Griffin before reverting to his previous role following the arrival of Ivan Cleary.

TexBet is an online bookmaker based in Tamworth NSW formed by Terry (Tex) O'Shea and his son Wade.

First announced in April the new bookmaker is set to be launched in a partnership with News Corp Australia and Las Vegas-based Tekkorp Capital and is slated to be operating in time for the spring racing carnivals in Melbourne and Sydney.

News Corp Australia has made significant investments in the wagering space in recent years.

It acquired Punters and Racenet in multimillion-dollar deals in 2016 and 2018 respectively.

In July last year it launched the biggest racing and sports wagering newsroom in Australia which produces content for an array of brands including all of its metropolitan and regional newspapers and websites.

Against all odds (in a nailbiting finish that almost left Jenny reaching for a sick bucket in anticipation) the Sydneysiders nudged out the competition with an unorthodox bathroom that they’d earlier admitted wasn’t to their taste.

Scotty’s little ‘out’ joke backfires badly

After placing last and getting some harsh words from Shaynna Darren Palmer and Neale Whitaker for their challenge room Omar and Oz decided to do some research and trawl through the judges’ Instagram profiles for inspiration.

After seeing the sort of decor Darren Neale and Shaynna preferred through their social media accounts the boys decided to put their own preferences aside and focus on creating rooms that others would like.

“These things shouldn’t work together and yet they do” Neale said approvingly when examining the boys’ patchwork of wood panelling herringbone wall tiles and patterned floor tiles.

Oz also spent the final moments before reveal watching a YouTube tutorial on artfully folding toilet paper which impressed the style savvy Shaynna.

Both proved to be a winning move. A big winning move with the duo pocketing the weekly $10000 prize a mature tree to plant on their property (which will be awarded each week to the victors’ for landscaping their 10-acre property) and a whopping $250000 in kitchen appliances.

“I could kiss that toilet paper!” an ecstatic Omar decried to his equally jubilant offsider.

While Omar and Oz celebrated victory Neighbours’ actress Sharon was reduced to tears by the harsh feedback on her moody bathroom.

Shaynna in particular was damning in her criticism of the styling choices Sharon had agonised over all week.

Admitting that House 3 was her favourite property on The Block this year Shaynna ranted that Sharon and Ankur were not showing the “old dame” the respect she deserved with their choices.

“Are you going to treat her like this? Because if you are going to treat her like this you’re going to have to deal with me” Shaynna said sounding not unlike some cowboy defending his woman’s honour in a bad midday movie.

“Well it ain’t this beautiful Victorian home that’s for sure” Shaynna countered.

Both Neale and Shaynna said they didn’t feel good standing in Sharon and Ankur’s “claustrophobic” and dark bathroom. But Darren rather liked its sultry moodiness.

The feedback wasn’t a massive surprise. Foremen Dan and Keith had earlier poured cold water on both its finishes and design with Keith labelling their efforts “disgusting” after his final defect inspection.

Despite going into their first challenge late but hugely confident Ryan and Rachel’s hopes of winning were dashed.

Mostly because they hadn’t been privy to the challenge room feedback that the judges were looking for rooms that honoured the home’s heritage.

Shaynna loved the thoughtful storage but questioned the double shower saying that was better used in a master ensuite rather than the main bathroom.

“Because siblings won’t be showering together. That would be weird” Palmer added.

Sharing second place both Jenny and Dylan and Sara-Jane and Tom’s bathrooms nailed the blend of old and new.

Unfortunately Sarah-Jane and Tom’s short shower screen and lack of suitable storage and Jenny and Dylan’s tiny shower cubicle cost them the prize.

Perhaps if they had thought to fold the toilet paper differently it could have been a different story.

JUDGES’ SCORES

Tom and Sarah-Jane: 25.5

Rachel and Ryan: 23.5

Ankur and Sharon: 20.5

Dylan and Jenny: 25.5

Reports from both News Corp and Nine mastheads originally broke the story with the 37-year-old reportedly informing his current club of his decision at training on Sunday.

Ciraldo's future has been widely speculated on this season with the in-demand coach declining a five-year offer from the Wests Tigers in June.

According to News Corp Ciraldo’s existing relationship with Bulldogs GM of football Phil Gould - who was previously GM at the Panthers - was a key factor in his decision.

A former Sharks Knights and Panthers player the Sydney-born coach was promoted to the role of assistant coach at Penrith in 2017.

He acted as caretaker coach for the club for six games in 2018 after the sacking of Anthony Griffin before reverting to his previous role following the arrival of Ivan Cleary.

News Corp Australia has made significant investments in the wagering space in recent years.

It acquired Punters and Racenet in multimillion-dollar deals in 2016 and 2018 respectively.

In July last year it launched the biggest racing and sports wagering newsroom in Australia which produces content for an array of brands including all of its metropolitan and regional newspapers and websites.

Tekkorp Capital is headed by Matt Davey an Australian-born betting entrepreneur and the former chief executive and major shareholder of NYX Gaming Group.

Against all odds (in a nailbiting finish that almost left Jenny reaching for a sick bucket in anticipation) the Sydneysiders nudged out the competition with an unorthodox bathroom that they’d earlier admitted wasn’t to their taste.

Scotty’s little ‘out’ joke backfires badly

After placing last and getting some harsh words from Shaynna Darren Palmer and Neale Whitaker for their challenge room Omar and Oz decided to do some research and trawl through the judges’ Instagram profiles for inspiration.

After seeing the sort of decor Darren Neale and Shaynna preferred through their social media accounts the boys decided to put their own preferences aside and focus on creating rooms that others would like.

“These things shouldn’t work together and yet they do” Neale said approvingly when examining the boys’ patchwork of wood panelling herringbone wall tiles and patterned floor tiles.

Oz also spent the final moments before reveal watching a YouTube tutorial on artfully folding toilet paper which impressed the style savvy Shaynna.

Both proved to be a winning move. A big winning move with the duo pocketing the weekly $10000 prize a mature tree to plant on their property (which will be awarded each week to the victors’ for landscaping their 10-acre property) and a whopping $250000 in kitchen appliances.

“I could kiss that toilet paper!” an ecstatic Omar decried to his equally jubilant offsider.

While Omar and Oz celebrated victory Neighbours’ actress Sharon was reduced to tears by the harsh feedback on her moody bathroom.

Shaynna in particular was damning in her criticism of the styling choices Sharon had agonised over all week.

Admitting that House 3 was her favourite property on The Block this year Shaynna ranted that Sharon and Ankur were not showing the “old dame” the respect she deserved with their choices.

“Are you going to treat her like this? Because if you are going to treat her like this you’re going to have to deal with me” Shaynna said sounding not unlike some cowboy defending his woman’s honour in a bad midday movie.

“Well it ain’t this beautiful Victorian home that’s for sure” Shaynna countered.

Both Neale and Shaynna said they didn’t feel good standing in Sharon and Ankur’s “claustrophobic” and dark bathroom. But Darren rather liked its sultry moodiness.

The feedback wasn’t a massive surprise. Foremen Dan and Keith had earlier poured cold water on both its finishes and design with Keith labelling their efforts “disgusting” after his final defect inspection.

Despite going into their first challenge late but hugely confident Ryan and Rachel’s hopes of winning were dashed.

Mostly because they hadn’t been privy to the challenge room feedback that the judges were looking for rooms that honoured the home’s heritage.

Shaynna loved the thoughtful storage but questioned the double shower saying that was better used in a master ensuite rather than the main bathroom.

“Because siblings won’t be showering together. That would be weird” Palmer added.

Sharing second place both Jenny and Dylan and Sara-Jane and Tom’s bathrooms nailed the blend of old and new.

Unfortunately Sarah-Jane and Tom’s short shower screen and lack of suitable storage and Jenny and Dylan’s tiny shower cubicle cost them the prize.

Perhaps if they had thought to fold the toilet paper differently it could have been a different story.

Tom and Sarah-Jane: 25.5

Rachel and Ryan: 23.5

Ankur and Sharon: 20.5

Dylan and Jenny: 25.5

He dreamed of someday becoming a marine biologist. But Levi’s world is changing.

Warming temperatures led to widespread Sargassum seaweed and harmful algae blooms in the Atlantic Ocean and 156-mile Indian River Lagoon which together encircle the island. The seaweed and algae blooms have left beaches stinking with rotting seaweed and dead marine life. In the Indian River Lagoon the algae blooms have caused an extensive loss of seagrass most notably leading to an unprecedented die-off of manatees which were left starving without any seagrass to eat. Some days Levi wore a mask at the beach to guard against the smell.

Warming temperatures also have contributed to more frequent and damaging storms and in 2017 a series of storms including Hurricane Irma which wrought billions of dollars in damage across the state caused flood waters to rise 18 inches in Levi’s front yard. His family had to fortify the home with sandbags to prevent further damage. After Levi’s mother became pregnant with his now 2-year-old half-sister Juniper a curious toddler with sparse blonde hair and big brown eyes the family decided it was time to abandon the island life and move to the mainland.

“It’s kind of disappointing not being able to live on the barrier island anymore because there’s so much fun stuff that I could do. Most of my friends they live on the barrier island” said Levi now in Melbourne. “It’s a mix of disappointment and also frustration frustration with leaders.”

When Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried announced a plan earlier this year aimed at putting the state on a path toward cleaner energy behind the plan were some 200 young Floridians all under the age of 25. Levi was the youngest. The young Floridians had found something in the state statutes with help from Our Children’s Trust an advocacy group that Florida leaders including Fried apparently had overlooked: that the statutes required Fried’s department to set goals for enhancing renewable energy use in the state. In Florida the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services oversees the state’s Office of Energy.

Florida is among the most vulnerable states to climate change and yet until now has lacked any real plan to address the main cause behind warming temperatures and wean the state from fossil fuels. Fried a Democrat is running against Gov. Ron DeSantis a Republican in this year’s gubernatorial race and she has railed against the governor for his inaction on the issue. DeSantis has focused instead on resilience projects saying he is “not a global warming person.”

The young Floridians filed a petition for rulemaking in January admonishing the state leaders and especially Fried for ignoring the statutory mandate. The petition called on the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and Fried to set goals for moving Florida toward 100 percent clean energy by 2050. After Fried announced a proposed rule in April for implementing the goals Levi felt proud about holding elected leaders accountable but felt they were capable of more.

“I’m glad that they’re doing something instead of not doing anything. But still I feel like they could have done better” said Levi about the rule which is expected to be finalized Aug. 9. “Like with a parent that they know that their kid just ran this race and placed fairly decently. They placed third. But they knew that their kid has the potential to do more. I guess it’s in some ways it’s sort of like that. Because I know that there’s more that they can do. But I’m glad that they did their best and I’m glad they did something.”

Florida's new goals call for 100 percent renewable energy by 2050

Nationwide nearly half of states along with Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have goals for moving toward 100 percent clean energy by midcentury a benchmark scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The Biden administration is aiming for 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. In Florida leaders have been hostile in recent years toward such goals leaving some local governments to step in with goals of their own although in 2021 the Legislature struck back with a measure effectively banning most local goals.

Florida’s new goals call on utilities to move toward 40 percent clean energy by 2030 63 percent by 2035 82 percent by 2040 and 100 percent by 2050. The goals are the same as those proposed by the young Floridians in their petition for rulemaking. The petition’s goals are based on a study by Evolved Energy Research a consulting firm that has conducted similar studies for other states.

The young Floridians’ 121-page petition relies on state policy dating back some 15 years to when former Gov. Charlie Crist then a Republican was in office. The Crist administration produced an Energy & Climate Change Action Plan and also set emission reduction targets that although they now are very out-of-date remain in effect according to the petition because the executive order setting the goals never was repealed or rescinded. Crist now a Democratic congressman representing the Tampa area also is running against Fried and DeSantis in the gubernatorial race. Crist and Fried will face off this month in the Florida primary for the Democratic nomination and one likely will go up against DeSantis in November.

“We read the law literally. You just read the law” said Andrea Rodgers senior litigation attorney at Our Children’s Trust which filed the petition on behalf of the young Floridians including Levi. “When we saw that that was a mandatory duty that had not been fulfilled that’s when we came up with a strategy to file the petition for rulemaking.”

The Crist administration’s clean energy goals effectively were abandoned in 2011 when his successor former Gov. Rick Scott a Republican and now U.S. senator took office. Scott transformed Florida policy on the environment and climate most notably banning the words “climate change” from state agencies making him a punchline of late-night comedians.

Since DeSantis took office in 2019 he has strived to make the environment a priority of his administration. The governor a potential front-runner for the GOP nomination in the 2024 presidential race has put millions of dollars toward the Everglades and other treasured and troubled waterways but has faced criticism for not doing more about Florida’s biggest environmental threat: climate change. The young Floridians contend in their petition the state is not on track to meet even the Crist administration’s very out-of-date renewable energy goals and that emissions have been on a statistically significant positive upward trajectory since 2009. The petition especially singles out Fried and her department.

“As of 2020 renewable energy accounted for merely 4.3 percent of Florida’s overall electricity generation” the petition states. “This lack of renewable energy development is due to the Commissioner’s and the Department’s sanctioning of the public utilities’ historic failure to develop and increase the use of renewable energy resources at the pace required by law and by the best available science.”

“I have a light inside me”

Now on the mainland Levi lives in a tidy ranch-style home with his mother step-father half-sister Juniper and dog Basil a staffordshire terrier and treeing walker coonhound mix with one brown eye and one blue eye. His mom Leigh-Ann Draheim raises Juniper homeschools Levi and works at the family’s church the Unitarian Universalist Church of Brevard in West Melbourne. Step-dad James Kilby is a professional photographer and tends the family’s elaborate home garden aimed at protecting fragile local waters from harmful lawn fertilizers and also sustaining the family. At the moment he is raising fruits vegetables and herbs with plans for more.

Levi is an affable teen with a bright smile and hair that usually he wears in a “giant Afro” which he describes as a “big part of who I am” although when we meet his hair is closely shorn. He is an accomplished unicycler and spends his spare time sailing in the Indian River Lagoon and also volunteering at the Brevard Zoo. He now dreams of becoming a search-and-rescue dog handler because he loves animals and loves helping people.

“My mom says that I don’t know how she usually describes it that I have a light inside me” he said with his mom beside him at the kitchen table. Works of art adorn the walls throughout the home colorful eclectic paintings collected from local artists. Many like one of a fish skeleton and blue-and-green Earth share a common theme of the environment and climate.

“I don’t know what that means exactly” Levi continued about the light inside him “but my mom says I have a light inside of me that helps me be a better person.”

Leigh-Ann stepped in to help clarify.

“He’s always had this really good energy about him that people are drawn to” she said. “Even when he was very little people would talk to him at the grocery store or at the library or whatever. He just had this sort of energy about him. So I think when he fell into this role I think it was a good thing for him because people are for whatever reason interested in Levi.”

Levi got involved with Our Children’s Trust through his church and in 2015 was among 21 young plaintiffs from across the country to file a lawsuit against the Obama administration challenging the federal government’s fossil fuel energy system. At about 8 years old Levi was the youngest. The plaintiffs contended the system violated their constitutional rights to freedom life liberty and property. The Trump administration later was substituted for the Obama administration. In 2020 an appeals court judge threw out the case.

Levi attended all the court hearings in Eugene Ore. and also traveled to Washington D.C. to talk with congressional leaders about the lawsuit and cause behind it. His mom always chaperoned. Over time the other plaintiffs became like siblings for Levi but the hardest part was sitting still through the hearings and meetings his mom recalled.

“He would sit there frustrated going ‘Don’t you see what’s happening? There’s hurricanes. We’ve had to evacuate my house’” she said. “He didn’t understand all the legal stuff. He just understood that his environment was being affected and that’s what he cared about.”

In 2018 Levi joined another lawsuit with other young Floridians against the Scott administration challenging the state’s energy system. The DeSantis administration later was substituted for the Scott administration. In 2021 an appeals court judge dismissed that case too but the young Floridians were not ready to give up. The attorneys went back to the statutes and discovered the mandate involving the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and renewable energy goals said Rodgers the senior litigation attorney at Our Children’s Trust.

For Florida climate change means hotter temperatures rising seas and more frequent and damaging storms. By 2045 the DeSantis administration predicts some $26 billion in residential property statewide will face chronic flooding. The young Floridians have faced these impacts in diverse ways. One young woman lives in the Florida Keys. A teen-age girl is a Seminole Indian whose heritage includes the Everglades. A teen-age boy lives on a Gainesville farm.

Levi has found his involvement in the litigation rewarding but also frustrating in a Republican-led state where leaders have taken next to no action on climate change for about a decade. He lives in a county that favored former President Donald Trump in 2020. Most of his friends have been supportive but a few do not get it. Some do not understand the problem he said. One friend asked why not speak up about “bigger” issues like racism and homophobia. Levi said he feels a unique responsibility about climate change as a person of color. He points out low-income communities and communities of color often are more vulnerable to impacts.

“African-American people sometimes most of the time we don’t live in as safe or as strong a neighborhood” said Levi. “Or if we do then it’s in the area that is more greatly affected than some other people that may have better opportunities.”

Natural gas remains Florida's primary energy source

Among Florida’s leading energy providers—Florida Power & Light Co. Duke Energy Florida and Tampa Electric Co.—all have made strides in recent years toward cleaner energy especially solar. FP&L parent company NextEra Energy Inc. announced a plan recently for eliminating carbon emissions completely from its operations by 2045 which some clean energy advocates have cheered as game-changing. Nonetheless natural gas remains the state’s primary energy source at 73 percent in 2020 double the national average the young Floridians say in their petition.

“At these rates of increase renewable energy production will not equal natural gas energy production until the year 2140” the petition states. “Taking five generations just to achieve parity between natural gas and renewable energy use represents an abject failure to capitalize on Florida’s ‘significant solar potential.’”

It is not clear how compliant Florida utilities will be with the state’s new renewable energy goals as the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services lacks the authority to enforce them. Instead the department will require utilities to submit their 10-year reports which the department will review for compliance and forward to the governor Legislature and Public Service Commission which oversees the state’s utilities.

“The question will be: Is the Public Service Commission willing to hold the utilities accountable?” said Rodgers of Our Children’s Trust. “That’s yet to be seen but that’s really how this should work.”

Others are less optimistic. Jonathan Webber legislative and political director at Florida Conservation Voters an advocacy group said the utilities need more accountability.

“There are a lot of ways that we can transition from where we are now to the clean renewable energy future we need” he said. “But unfortunately the way it’s going is that’s going to be completely on the utilities’ terms to maximize profits as opposed to helping Floridians.”

As for Levi he has spent half his life at this point involved in climate litigation aimed at holding federal and state leaders accountable on fossil fuels. He said he would not have it any other way.

“If you were given an opportunity to stop an explosion that would kill everyone and you’re given that opportunity to stop it. If you don’t take that opportunity and you survive that’s something that will always be there that you’ll always know that you didn’t do something that you could’ve done” he said. “So I think that if you think about it that way that if I didn’t if I don’t take action then that will be something that will hang with me that I’ll know that I didn’t do something that I could have done.”

Not only did the Los Angeles Lakers legend make basketball history but he also left an indelible mark on performance footwear.

Bryant's signature line was so popular that Nike began releasing his retro shoes with performance upgrades (known as Protro) in 2018. Fans and hoopers alike were able to pick up the Kobe 1 Kobe 4 and Kobe 5 Protros with relative ease.

Following Bryant's tragic passing in January 2020 Nike's vision for the Kobe line became less clear. The Kobe 6 Protro dropped in limited colorways and stock. Not to mention Nike and the Bryant estate were unable to agree on a new contract for 11 months.

Luckily in March 2022 the two parties announced a new partnership. Now Nike might be bringing back a fan favorite soon. The Instagram account @kobe_archive posted a picture of an all-black pair of sneakers with the caption ""Kobe 8 Protro Wear-Test Sample - Rumored to release Fall 22’ c/o @patchenhz_97.""

FanNation Kicks cannot verify if the rumors are true. But they are certainly exciting. Nike has not released Kobe Protro sneakers in chronological order. Jumping over the Kobe 7 to the Kobe 8 would not be surprising.

Eric Avar designed the the Nike Kobe 8 System which was originally released in December 2012 for $140. Nike used engineered mesh in the minimalist basketball shoe which was a first in company history. Bryant wore the Kobe 8 throughout his incredible run during the second half of the 2011-12 NBA season.

Nike has not given any hint at the future of the Kobe Protro series. Fans have speculated that the Kobe 8 could be the next installment but there are no official images or release dates.

However the company did agree to a new contract with Chicago Bulls forward DeMar DeRozan two weeks ago. According to Shams Charania of The Athletic DeRozan will be the featured face of the Nike Kobe line.

Hopefully now that Nike and the Bryant estate are back in business loyal fans will be able to once again purchase the classic hoop shoes. We will keep you updated as we learn more. Stay locked into FanNation Kicks for breaking news updates and interviews.

Editor's Notes: Cactus Plant Flea Market is stepping back into the world of Nike; and once again has proven that no one matches its statement-making abilities where sneaker design is concerned. A bold statement sure but on review of its last couple of Swoosh-backed drops it's one I'm willing to stand by.

Armed with a DIY unconventional and totally batshit crazy approach to sneaker design Cactus Plant Flea Market has delivered a selection of Nike's wildest styles of all time.

First in line was the VaporMax 2019 which turned the silhouette on its head with rope lacing stitched-on details a neon sign-like 3D Swoosh and a bold smiley face graphic at the heel. Its two-piece Dunk Low selection was in the grand scheme of things pretty tame clearing the road ahead for the head-spinning Flea 1.

The mud-encased grass-like CPFM Flea 1 was a precursor of things to come with the ""Overgrown"" or ""Grinch"" Dunk Low.

While there is some confusion regarding which monicker will be the official name come release day this might just be the most insane sneaker ever put to market.

Once again a mud-encased sole has been chosen but is mostly hidden thanks to the overgrown shaggy piles of green faux fur that cover the sneaker's upper. Amongst the thick hair you'll find a hidden yin-yan logo and green lining – I'm sure there are laces in there somewhere too.

Clearly CPFM is allowed to do whatever it wants when a Nike silhouette is placed in front of it leaving us wondering what could possibly come next.

It was the first Reading & Northern steam doubleheader since 1988. Reading & Northern owner Andy Muller decided to run the event as a doubleheader to mark his 75th birthday which also fell on Saturday. Muller who was onboard the excursion told Trains News Wire that the two locomotives operated flawlessly and that passengers applauded as he walked through the train.

The train with 19 cars ran from R&N’s Reading Outer Station to Jim Thorpe about 67 miles where passengers had several hours for tourist activities or lunch. Matching SD50 diesels in the special paint scheme to promote the railroad’s North Reading Fast Freight pulled the train back to the wye at Nesquehoning Junction/Jim Thorpe Junction turned it and brought it back to Jim Thorpe. There the steam locomotives were cut off and stairs were set up to allow public cab visits.

Also operating from Jim Thorpe on Saturday were R&N’s former Norfolk Southern F7A and B units which were pulling the railroad’s trains through Lehigh Gorge which operate several times a weekend. Normally these are pulled by GP38-2s or GP30s.

With the steam locomotives reattached the train made a run-by in Jim Thorpe then departed on the return leg. For operational reasons the steam locomotives were cut off in Port Clinton Pa. home of the railroad’s steam shops with the SD50s providing power for the final 20 miles to Reading.

The last of the summer’s Iron Horse Rambles is set for Saturday Sept. 3. Like the others it is sold out. The R&N also plans to run some fall foliage trips with No. 2102 later this year.

More photos from the trip are below.

If they aspire to see their name splashed on the ticker in Times Square less than 13 miles away the 312 players in the field will first need to play well enough in the 36-hole test on Monday and Tuesday at Arcola and nearby The Ridgewood Country Club the championship host.

After that six head-to-head victories will be required at Ridgewood to join some of the game’s most illustrious names in raising the prized Havemeyer Trophy. The champion also earns an exemption into the 2023 U.S. Open at The Los Angeles Country Club along with a spot in The Open Championship at Royal Liverpool and a likely invitation to the Masters in April.

Getting into match play and continuing to advance also raises the likelihood that a player will earn some airtime during the 15 hours that the championship will be broadcast starting on Wednesday and continuing through Sunday on Peacock and Golf Channel. Ridgewood is the better-known course having hosted four previous USGA championships including the 1974 U.S. Amateur (won by Jerry Pate) and the 1990 U.S. Senior Open (won by Lee Trevino). It has also hosted a Ryder Cup an LPGA Tour event and four editions of one of the PGA Tour’s playoff events (The Barclays/Northern Trust). The championship layout is a composite of holes from its three classic A.W. Tillinghast nines – seven from the East six from the West and five from the Center nine.

Here are 3 Things to Know heading into stroke play of the USGA’s oldest championship.

Austin’s Power

It was right there for the taking. Last year at Oakmont (Pa.) Country Club Austin Greaser held a 3-up lead through 27 holes of the 36-hole U.S. Amateur final. But James Piot rallied with three late birdies and Greaser made a couple of costly bogeys en route to a 2-and-1 defeat. Afterward Greaser called it “the opportunity of a lifetime” knowing that such chances are rare.

But the rising senior at the University of North Carolina is back for another shot at it and he comes in off an impressive victory. Greaser captured the prestigious Western Amateur on Aug. 6 at Exmoor Country Club in Highland Park Ill. rallying to defeat Mateo Fernandez de Oliveira of Argentina 1 up in the 18-hole championship match. In the semifinals earlier that day he topped 2021 USA Walker Cup player and world No. 23 William Mouw.

Currently No. 5 in the World Amateur Golf Ranking® Greaser of Vandalia Ohio also was one of four amateurs to make the cut in the U.S. Open at The Country Club in June. Having improved on his semifinal showing in the 2021 Western he appears primed to make another run at the Havemeyer. It’s not an easy double to pull off though. Since 1980 only six players have managed it in the same season. Danny Lee of New Zealand in 2008 is the most recent.

Depth of Field

One thing’s for sure – getting to Wednesday’s Round of 64 won’t be easy. With 312 players the U.S. Amateur has by far the largest field of any USGA championship as befits the 7749 entries that were accepted by the June 22 deadline. It’s also historically the strongest field in amateur golf and barely 20 percent will move on match play.

Once there however it won’t matter whether you earned a qualifying medal or eked your way in through a 12-for-1 playoff as David Nyfjall did last year. Nyfjall of Sweden who totaled 3-over-par 143 went on to defeat the No. 1 seed Mark Goetz who had scorched Oakmont and stroke-play co-host Longue Vue Club for an 8-under 132 total.

Just get into match play and it’s anyone’s game from there – that’s the players’ mantra and with good reason. Per statistical guru Justin Ray of Twenty First Group since 2010 a higher percentage of players in the Round of 16 have come from those seeded No. 41 and above (47 players 24.5 percent) than from the top 10 seeds (42 players 21.9 percent).

There may or may not be a medalist jinx but in the past seven years only one medalist or co-medalist has advanced beyond the Round of 32 (that was Cole Hammer who reached the semifinals in 2018). Ryan Moore (2004) was the most recent of the five medalists who have won the championship in the past 40 years.

Target Score

Total par for stroke play will be 141 with Ridgewood playing to par 71 and Arcola to par 70. One would have to think that even par would be a pretty good target score as it has comfortably gotten players inside the top 64 each of the past seven years. As noted Nyfjall was the lone player among a group of 12 at 3 over to get into the draw at Oakmont and the lowest score to get in – or play off for spots – is 2 over which has happened twice (2016 Oakland Hills; 2020 Bandon Dunes). The highest score to get into match play in that timeframe is 5 over in 2019 at Pinehurst Resort & Country Club. In 2017 and 2018 4 over was the magic number for the back-to-back championships in California first at Riviera and then at Pebble Beach.

US Navy/MCS2 Ernest R. Scott

The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is the US Navy's newest airborne early warning and control aircraft.

It took its first flight on August 3 2007 and was delivered to the Navy in 2010.

The E-2D is the Navy's eye in the sky guiding friends and tracking foes from hundreds of miles away.

On August 3 the US Navy's ""digital quarterback"" the Northrop Grumman E-2D Advanced Hawkeye celebrated the 15th anniversary of its first flight.

The E-2D is the newest variant of the E-2 airborne early warning and control aircraft. In service since 1964 it is a considerable improvement over its predecessors.

It is one of the Navy's greatest force multipliers — an eye in the sky that can spot everything and anything within hundreds of miles and guide other aircraft and ships into battle.

Like its predecessors it is an essential part of the Navy's aviation force and a vital component of any carrier air wing — so much so that it is still being upgraded to ensure a longer service life.

Airborne early warning and control

The mission of any airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft is to detect and track enemy aircraft ships missiles and vehicles from far away in order to keep friendly units appraised of the threats they face in real-time.

AEW&C aircraft also provide command and control acting as a communications hub to relay data intelligence orders and communications between friendly units and commanders.

The US Navy's first purpose-built airborne early warning aircraft was the E-1 Tracer built by Grumman — the predecessor to Northrop Grumman — in 1956. The E-1 was based on the C-1 Trader a carrier-based cargo plane derived from the S-2 Tracker a carrier-based anti-submarine-warfare aircraft.

Instantly recognizable because of the large aerofoil-shaped radar dome mounted on its roof the E-1 saw extensive service in the early years of the Vietnam War supporting combat air patrols and bombing runs in both North and South Vietnam and warning friendly forces of enemy MiG activity.

As it was an interim aircraft the E-1 was only in Navy service for six years before the E-2 Hawkeye replaced it in 1964 though the it wasn't officially taken out of service until 1977.

The E-2 was a considerable upgrade given its all-weather capability and turboprop engines. It first saw service in Vietnam and quickly gained a reputation as the Navy's electronic eyes. It quickly became a vital part of the carrier air wing and served in every theater of naval operations.

There have been several E-2 variants with the E-2D being the latest and most modern. It was first flown on August 3 2007 and was delivered to the Navy in 2010.

The E2-D can reach speeds of 300 knots and can fly up to 37000 feet. Its crew consists of two pilots and three naval flight officers who man and monitor the electronics on board.







The all-weather AN/APY-9 radar mounted over its fuselage can scan a full 360 degrees detecting air and surface targets simultaneously and suppressing electronic interference according to its manufacturer Lockheed Martin.

The E-2D also has an all-glass cockpit with fully electronic flight instruments giving pilots greater situational awareness while flying and more precision when using their avionics.

Other upgrades include an advanced Identification Friend or Foe System a new mission computer and tactical workstations and modernized communications and data-link suites.

The E-2D's modern systems allow the naval flight officers on board to coordinate the operations of multiple air and surface strike groups while being far from the action itself.

""For 50 years the E-2 has done something no other carrier-based aircraft can do and that's take a very capable radar system to 25000 feet hundreds of miles forward from the carrier and manage the airspace"" said Rear Adm. Randy Mahr the E-2 program manager from 2005 to 2008.

E-2Ds are especially important for defending Navy assets as they can track fast-moving targets like missiles jets and drones. E-2Ds are among the first aircraft to take off from a carrier at the start of any operation and are usually the last to land.

An E-2D moves into launch position aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln on July 18 2019. US Navy/MCS3 Dan Snow

Hawkeyes are so important that they continue to receive upgrades the most notable of which is an aerial refueling probe. Aerial refueling enables E-2Ds to fly as long as eight hours. It has been refueled by a crewed tanker aircraft and by the new MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drone.

So far 55 E-2Ds have been delivered — 10 with an aerial refueling probe — and 23 more have been ordered. The Navy asked Congress to order another eight for a total inventory of 86 aircraft. The service's ultimate goal is to have 22 E-2Ds operational at any time and because of the aircraft's importance the Navy hopes to keep it flying well into the 2040s.

Oskin South Lake Tablet

Brian Broadway Pastor and Founder of Living Message Church and Find Feed & Restore has been diligently working with a variety of missionary projects to help hundreds of needy families of South Lake over the past 12 years.

Brian and his wife Allison Broadway are the Lead Pastors and Co-Founders of Living Message Church of Downtown Clermont. They are originally from North Babylon in Long Island New York near Farmingdale.

Brian studied computer information systems at the State University of New York in Farmingdale. His father worked as an engineer for Northrop-Grumman and his mother was a professional beautician. Growing up the youngest of four a brother and two sisters he was very active in school basketball football track gymnastics and all team-oriented sports. His parents encouraged active community involvement while always teaching kindness integrity and how to make good choices in life. He first worked as a volunteer Youth Pastor and helped lead numerous missionary trips to Ghana Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Teamwork and community service became compassion for him.

Brian Broadway’s true passion for helping others in need. He learned to believe life is all about helping others to lead happy and healthy lives. After visiting his brother Chuck the Clermont Police Chief he and his family decided to move to Clermont. His sisters parents and entire set of 4 families moved to Florida at the same time.

Once in Clermont they opened the Living Message Church. Allison shares Brian’s passions. She supervises all of the Living Message Church administrative work as well as all of the volunteers and children’s programs with their ‘Little Messengers’. She has developed an environment where children can learn share and grow with fellowship. Their children’s ministry is for newborn infants and nursery to four years old.

The Living Message Church has a strong youth ministry known for its warm friendly non-denominational Christian environment. It offers two Sunday morning prayer services; the 8:30 AM service and the 10:00 AM Sunday service which includes live music. Services are also offered online.

Coffee and snacks are provided.

An important mission of the Living Message Church is to help the needy and homeless with guidance counsel food shelter and a positive direction. The ministry owns and shares six donated RVs 2 trailer homes and a duplex for use by homeless families until they can get back on their feet.

The ministry recently acquired several acres of land in Groveland for future development. It offers a Two Plus Two Program where recipients are helped with pay for two months going backward as well as for two months going forward. A large motor coach with a few tents serve as after-school education hot meals distribution and support services to homeless families living in old hotels and schools. This program offers job placement and career guidance support. It provides vouchers for the homeless to purchase clothes and more from the New Beginnings Thrift Store.

The Community Foundation of South Lake gave the ministry a series of grants totaling over $431000 dollars over the past 5 years which will enable them to expand their services and to acquire a Groveland property for Restore Lake. CFSLC Director Kathy Smith shares “Our first grant to Find Feed & Restore was provided by the Community Foundation Women’s Giving Alliance a giving circle that has a mission to help women and children here in South Lake. Over the past 7 years we have provided a number of grants and opportunities to help open a lot of doors for our community. I was happy to help connect Brian Broadway and FFR directly with donors and sponsors. We want to invest in this organization to show their wonderful and measurable impact. Brian Broadway and his team have successfully taken care of the homeless while helping the homeless become self-sufficient again so they can responsibly return back to society.” She adds “There are plenty of matching fund opportunities. One of our fund holders donated $50000 with a challenge for others to donate. While Lake Restore still needs $175000 to finish building out Phase One that same group will match any other donation up to $50000. Anyone can start a fund to work with us and to set up their own guidelines to help targeted community groups.”

Restore Lake is the ministry’s newest and most exciting project now under Phase One Construction. Formerly an AAA Sports Camp Lake Restore is now being built as a model community that can be replicated in other areas to help the homeless handicapped disadvantaged individuals as well as single women in distress with their children. This facility will have 12 small 2-bedroom apartments. With a communal kitchen area families will have a small home within their first big building. Many extra free services will be provided for residents including free haircuts dentistry and legal support. Others will be able to receive help with rent and mortgage assistance. A case manager a mental health support team healthcare and board security will be on site.

A Lake Restore grand opening and ribbon cutting are being planned for Fall 2022. Once Phase One is complete and open Phase 2 will start by knocking down the old farmhouse to make way for modern new buildings and housing for women distressed by domestic violence. Besides the existing boating and fishing dock there will eventually be a new playground for the children a dog run and other recreational amenities. Phase Three will add a variance for 8 to 15 tiny homes near the front of the Restore Lake property.

Broadway notes “If you want a free tour of the new Restore Lake property and facilities just ask!”

The Live Well Foundation paid the $215000 balance on this Restore Lake property so the land is now totally paid for. Broadway notes “We partner with organizations that share the same mission and characteristics as we do. We remain thankful to the CFSLC Live Well Foundation Westgate Foundation The Neighborhood Center Harper Foundation First United Methodist Church our monthly donors and everyone who has helped.”

Brian Broadway add “Our exegetical church family will live by the language history and culture of the bible. My passion lies in our faith! Faith drives me! Our bible helps us to help people in need. We have grown with a great leadership team. Milestone Counseling & Family Life Counseling Center handles our Mental Health counseling. Shannon Herrera leads our team plus oversees all fundraising. Lisa Bishop manages our programs and Dennis Carter manages our operations.” Pastor Brian writes the grants and directs the vision.

Pastor Broadway’s mission is far from complete. He plans to offer free counseling to those in prison.

The aerial unit of arms manufacturing conglomerate Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Aeronautics has won a contract that would see its pockets grow more than $7.6 billion deeper according to the Pentagon.

The deal is a US Navy modification contract under which Lockheed Martin will produce 129 new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets the US Department of Defense announced.

""Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. Fort Worth Texas is awarded a not-to-exceed $7630940571... contract"" the Defense Department said in a press release on Friday. ""This modification increases the ceiling to procure 129 Lot 15 aircraft.""

The order includes F-35A aircraft for the US Air Force; three F-35B aircraft and ten F-35C aircraft for the Marine Corps; 15 F-35C aircraft for the US Navy; 32 F-35A aircraft and four F-35B aircraft for non-Defense Department participants; and 16 F-35A aircraft for Foreign Military Sales customers the release added.

Around 57% of the work on the contract will be performed in Forth Worth Texas 14% in El Segundo California and 9% in Warton the United Kingdom the release also said.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said in January it had sued to stop the acquisition of the country's last independent supplier of missile propulsion systems over concerns that Lockheed would use its leverage to harm rival defense contractors. One month later Lockheed Martin scrapped a $4.4 billion deal to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne after the FTC moved to block it.

Lockheed Martin however is still conducting business as usual with Washington as it handed over its first operational Multiple Rocket Launch System (MLRS) to the US Army the company announced in mid-July.

According to the arms conglomerate the MLRS can be carried on heavy military airlift carriers and they are designed to destroy artillery air defense concentrations trucks light armor and personnel carrier at distances further than previously possible while having the ability to relocate at high speed.

Two days after the handover the US announced that it launched two hypersonic missiles manufactured by the company in light of mounting concerns that China and Russia have had more success manufacturing and developing their own homemade hypersonic weapons.

The latest time period has seen the US conduct successful hypersonic weapons tests in a change from its usual failures raising questions about cost and increasing concerns that Washington has been failing in what is now dubbed a superpower arms race.

Arms manufacturers like Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies have all touted their hypersonic weapons programs to investors in a bid to further benefit from wars and the shift to the new arms race in light of surging tensions around the globe.

M270 MLRSs are among the weapons handed out to Kiev as part of the influx of western arms to the country in light of the Ukraine war. However Ukraine has been found to be selling weapons it acquired from the West on the black market due to the Kiev forces' limited ability to use them because of their lack of training logistical challenges and the diminishing size of the Ukrainian armed forces as per former Pentagon advisor Karen Kwiatkowski.

At the start of June the White House announced that the United States was sending a new batch of military supplies to Ukraine. The new batch of arms supply is worth $450 million in shipments.

Though the United States has been taking care of providing training for the Ukrainian soldiers when it comes to arms they are not accustomed to Kiev is still selling its arms to the black market due to ""inexperience"".

The private American competitor to Europe’s Arianespace has emerged as a key contender to plug a temporary gap alongside Japan and India but final decisions depend on the still unresolved timetable for Europe’s delayed Ariane 6 rocket.

“I would say there are two and a half options that we’re discussing. One is SpaceX that is clear. Another one is possibly Japan” ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher told Reuters.

“Japan is waiting for the inaugural flight of its next generation rocket. Another option could be India” he added in an interview.

“SpaceX I would say is the more operational of those and certainly one of the back-up launches we are looking at.”

Aschbacher said talks remained at an exploratory phase.

“We of course need to make sure that they are suitable. It’s not like jumping on a bus” he said. For example the interface between satellite and launcher must be suitable and the payload must not be compromised by unfamiliar types of launch vibration.

“We are looking into this technical compatibility but we have not asked for a commercial offer yet. We just want to make sure that it would be an option in order to make a decision on asking for a firm commercial offer” Aschbacher said.

SpaceX did not reply to a request for comment.

SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has already swept up other customers severing ties with Moscow’s increasingly isolated space sector amid the Ukraine conflict but a high-profile European mission could be seen as a significant win for the U.S. rocket maker.

Aschbacher stressed any back-up solution would be temporary however adding he was not worried about the future of Ariane 6.

Satellite internet firm OneWeb a competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet venture booked at least one Falcon 9 launch in March. It has also booked an Indian launch.

On Monday Northrop Grumman booked three Falcon 9 missions to ferry NASA cargo to the International Space Station while it designs a new version of its Antares rocket whose Russian-made engines were withdrawn by Moscow in response to sanctions.

‘Wake-up call’

Europe has until now depended on the Italian Vega for small payloads Russia’s Soyuz for medium ones and the Ariane 5 for heavy missions. Its next-generation Vega C staged a debut last month and the new Ariane 6 designed in two versions to replace both the Ariane 5 and Soyuz has been delayed until next year.

Aschbacher said a more precise Ariane 6 schedule would be clearer by October after current hot-firing testing. ESA would then finalise a back-up plan to be presented to ministers of the agency’s 22 nations in November he said adding the most recent Ariane 6 delay was not the result of any signifcant new setback.

“But yes the likelihood of the need for back-up launches is high” he said. “The order of magnitude is certainly a good handful of launches that we would need interim solutions for.”

Aschbacher said the Ukraine conflict had demonstrated Europe’s decade-long cooperation strategy with Russia in gas supplies and other areas including space was no longer working.

“This was a wake up call that we have been too dependent on Russia. And this wake-up call we have to hope that decision makers realise it as much as I do that we have to really strengthen our European capability and independence.”

However he played down the prospect of Russia carrying out a pledge to withdraw from the International Space Station (ISS).

Russia’s newly appointed space chief Yuri Borisov said in a televised meeting with President Vladimir Putin last month that Russia would withdraw from the ISS “after 2024”.

But Borisov later clarified that Russia’s plans had not changed and Western officials said Russia’s space agency had not communicated any new pullout plans.

“The reality is that operationally the work on the space station is proceeding I would say almost nominally” Aschbacher told Reuters. “We do depend on each other like it or not but we have little choice.”"
NCLH,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZ2NhcHRhaW4uY29tL2NydWlzZS1saW5lcy1jcmV3LXNob3J0YWdlcy1sZWFkLXRvLWNhbmNlbGVkLXRyaXBzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise Lines' Crew Shortages Lead To Canceled Trips,"By Carly Wanna

Aug 13 2022 (Bloomberg) –Cruise ships are filling up again but passengers have been reporting back quicker than crew members.

Carnival Corp.’s Princess Cruises this week canceled 11 fall sailings on its Diamond Princess saying it couldn’t provide the level of service customers expect amid ongoing labor shortages. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. another large operator told investors it’s had to limit capacity on the Pride of America because of staffing. The ship which sails the Hawaiian islands is required to have a crew that’s mostly US citizens a tall order in this tight labor market.

“We’re not immune to it” Norwegian’s chief executive officer Frank Del Rio said of industrywide labor shortages.

Even though cruise lines have been relaxing requirements for Covid tests and reporting stronger bookings it’s still been choppy sailing. Norwegian shares fell 11% on Aug. 9 after the company forecast a loss in the current quarter as it continues to deal with challenges such as the pandemic the Russia-Ukraine conflict and “current macroeconomic conditions.” The stock has since rebounded.

Princess’s cancellations comes after a rocky few months. P&O Cruises another Carnival division canceled seven voyages earlier this summer due to staffing shortages. But other adjustments have been more subtle. Carnival Cruise Line the company’s namesake brand scaled back some of its offerings this summer including suspending some special events like its parties for loyal cruisers and instead provided perks like onboard credit or cocktail vouchers. Now those events have returned.

Still missing and likely gone for the foreseeable future are the 24/7 pizzerias.

“There will be pizza available for virtually the entire time most guests are awake” Chris Chiames a spokesman for Carnival Cruise Line said in an email. The company also scaled back its complimentary birthday cakes and a chocolate extravaganza buffet cuts made in part due to low staffing as well as general adjustments to match guest demand according to Chiames.

Carnival offered incentives including bonuses and greater contract flexibility to increase the number of staffers. Those have now been discontinued.

Jim Walker a Miami Florida-based maritime lawyer estimates that fewer than 5% of cruise-ship employees are American citizens or residents. He says long hours and low pay make most crew positions unattractive to domestic workers.

Most crew members hail from the Philippines Indonesia India and throughout the Caribbean islands according to Walker. Generally non-US citizens require a visa to work on ships that travel in and out of American ports.

The number of visas processed by the State Department declined as much as 90% during the pandemic according to Jorge Loweree managing director of programs at the American Immigration Council an advocacy group. Around March the department’s overall issuance of visas rebounded to pre-pandemic levels but Loweree says the agency had to play catch up on two years of backlogs.

Long processing times have affected a range of industries from health care to construction and have cost immigrants their jobs as they await renewal.

Nathaniel Derrenbacher a spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. the second-largest operator said his company hasn’t canceled any voyages due to staffing.

“Like most businesses we’ve faced challenges outside of our control while we bring our staffing back to full capacity” Derrenbacher wrote in an email.

While cruise operators have tried to maintain their offerings some passengers have complained of inadequate service. Linda Warhaftig said trash littered the decks of the Carnival Horizon and Conquest when she sailed on them in June. The 59-year-old who has been on 65 cruises said such a sight would have been unimaginable before the pandemic.

“After what I witnessed in June I canceled my Carnival cruises for the rest of this year” Warhaftig said.

Carnival spokesman Chiames said the line had an extremely busy summer with most ships sailing full. “We know our guests deserve a great vacation and if there were times when we fell short we certainly apologize” he said.

Despite the setbacks bookings remain high and consumer sentiment is robust according to Jefferies Group analyst David Katz.

“I think there’s some expectation that service levels are not going to be just yet what they had been” he said.

As an industry they are saying that they are following the advice of medical professionals and working to reflect the societal norms in many parts of the world.

The move to drop one of the last key restrictions for travelers comes just a month after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ended its COVID oversight program of the cruise industry. In July the CDC quietly withdrew its voluntary COVID protocols under which ships reported cases of the virus and continued restrictions ranging from pre-cruise testing to requirements that most passengers and crew be vaccinated. While saying the risks remained and that it would continue to provide guidance to the cruise lines and travelers the CDC cited the progress of the cruise lines and the strong protocols in place.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings the parent company of Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises was the first to confirm the shift in policy making the announcement on August 8 saying it was moving to align the company with the broader travel leisure and hospitality industry. Vaccinated guests aged 12 and over will no longer have any pre-cruise COVID-19 related protocols and unvaccinated guests may embark with a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours prior to departure subject to local regulations according to the policies posted to the three cruise lines’ websites.

“Our long-awaited revisions to our testing and vaccination requirements bring us closer in line with the rest of society which has learned to adapt and live with COVID-19 and makes it simpler and easier for our loyal guests” said Frank Del Rio President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. “The relaxation of protocols coupled with continued easing of travel restrictions and the reopening to cruise in more ports around the globe are meaningfully positive for our business as it reduces friction expands the addressable cruise market brings variety to itineraries and provides additional catalysts on the road to recovery.”

By week’s end the Royal Caribbean Group which owns Royal Caribbean International Celebrity Cruises and Silversea as well as Carnival Corporation had followed suit with a similar end to the vaccination requirements. Carnival Corporation’s brands from Carnival Cruise Line to Holland America Princess Cunard and others all quickly announced the changes to their policies also due to take effect in early September.

""Our ships have been sailing very full all summer but there is still room for more of our loyal guests and these guidelines will make it a simpler process and make cruising accessible for those who were not able to meet the protocols we were required to follow for much of the past 14 months"" said Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line.

While travelers were pleased to hear the news the end to the requirement varies both by destination and length of cruise. In most cases they are still keeping the rules in place for longer cruises lasting more than 16-days. In addition many foreign destinations are still requiring that passengers be vaccinated for the cruise ships to visit their ports.

The end of the vaccination requirement however is still seen as a key step in the efforts for the industry to rebound. Marking one year since cruises resumed from U.S. ports Carnival Cruise Line at the beginning of August highlighted that it has welcomed back three million passengers to its ships. They said that some of their ships were expected to operate with as high as 110 percent of occupancy (meaning they are using third and fourth berths in cabins mostly for families).

Major cruise companies have reported a strong rebound in occupancy. Royal Caribbean International for example said during its second quarter occupancy was back to 84 percent with it reaching 90 percent in June and some Caribbean voyages over 100 percent for the summer. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings operated with a lower 65 percent occupancy during the second quarter as the corporation sought to limit discounts and drive cash flow from operations. The company turned cash positive in March 2022 and generated approximately $260 million in cash from operations in the second quarter.

The industry’s optimism is driven by strong future sales. All the cruise lines report strong future bookings. Norwegian for example in this week’s earnings report said this quarter set a new record for total advance ticket sales and the prices were at record levels for the full year 2023. The end of the vaccination requirements is seen as another encouraging step and the cruise lines are hopeful that as problems recede with air travel that their bookings and occupancy will continue to rise.

Carnival Cruise Line Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean have all released big updates along with developments on rockslides and cancellations.

We’ve had a busy week of cruise news and as expected protocols have started to ease even further. Carnival Cruise Line has finally announced it will open up to unvaccinated guests which we will get into later in the post. Princess Cruises is dropping the vaccine mandate for most sailings Royal Caribbean is dropping the vaccine requirements from select homeports and pre-cruise testing is being dropped by two more Carnival-owned brands.

We’ve also got the latest developments on the rockslide in Skagway which is impacting cruises and news on cruise cancellations due to staff shortages.

Princess Cruises Relaxes Vaccine Requirement

We start with Princess Cruises which announced on Friday that it’s removing the vaccine requirement for most sailings and eliminating pre-cruise testing for vaccinated guests.

Starting September 6 vaccinated guests sailing on a cruise of fewer than 16 days in length will no longer have to test before boarding. They just need to upload proof of their vaccination on the OceanReady app.

Unvaccinated guests or those who do not provide proof of vaccination on those itineraries will only need to self-test within three days of sailing and upload evidence of a negative test before boarding to the Oceanready app.

The new guidelines are for all sailings where government requirements allow the cruise line to implement these guidelines. The exceptions are cruises sailing to and/or from Canada Greece and Australia.

In the past week Royal Caribbean announced a further easing of its protocols by dropping the vaccine requirements on select sailings from September 5 2022. This easing applies to departures out of Los Angeles in California Galveston in Texas New Orleans in Louisiana and cruises in Europe.

This now means that regardless of vaccination status guests can cruise on the select sailings as long as they meet any testing requirements.

For cruises out of Galveston and New Orleans that visit Grand Cayman only passengers that show a valid vaccination record can go ashore. When it comes to the select European cruises unvaccinated guests will have to take a test onboard to be allowed ashore in Greece or Spain.

Guests will still need to follow the pre-cruise testing requirements. For departures five nights or less out of Los Angeles and Galveston unvaccinated guests aged 2 and over must show a negative test result to sail. Vaccinated guests regardless of age no longer need to test for the shorter sailings.

When it comes to cruises that are six nights or more all guests aged 2 and over must present a negative test result taken within three days before departure.

Testing requirements for sailings in Europe are unchanged. Royal Caribbean is finalizing the testing for departures out of New Orleans.

What’s notably missing are Eastern Caribbean cruises. Royal Caribbean said it was working with local governments in the Eastern Caribbean to align vaccination requirements for more itineraries.

Princess Cruises Cancellations

Princess Cruises has been forced to cancel a limited number of voyages for the Diamond Princess cruise ship which includes departures out of San Diego California. It comes as the cruise line is dealing with labor shortages while occupancy levels rise across its ships.

It does mean that the cruise line has canceled a total of 11 voyages for the Diamond Princess out of San Diego from September 1 2022 through November 13 2022.

Princess wants to make sure the guest experience onboard remains exceptional and by canceling the voyages it allows more time to increase the crew levels.

The good news is impacted guests have the option for a replacement voyage departing in 2022 or 2023 but departing out of Los Angeles California rather than San Diego.

The vessel has already been on pause for more than two years and before the announced cancellations the ship was scheduled to resume sailings with guests on September 1 2022 from San Diego. This included that first five-night voyage with visits to San Francisco in California and Ensenada in Mexico.

The ship’s first return voyage will now depart San Diego on November 13 on a seven-night itinerary.

Skagway Rockslides Impact Cruises

Another rockslide adjacent to the popular White Pass Railroad Dock in Skagway Alaska has caused damage and led to the full closure of the dock which is expected to remain closed for the rest of the 2022 sailing season.

The most recent rockslide was on Friday August 5 following a slide just two days earlier on August 3. Both rockslides caused damage to the White Pass Railroad Dock and the latest slide caused significant damage to shipping containers placed along the length of the dock.

With just two months remaining in the Alaska sailing season Princess Cruises is removing Skagway from 10 upcoming itineraries. This is due to the closure of the forward berth of the White Pass Railroad Dock the only viable docking position for the cruise line’s Royal-class vessels the largest ships in the Princess Cruises fleet.

Rather than calling on Skagway each cruise will instead substitute a different Alaskan port of call. The impacted cruises include the Majestic Princess which will call at Icy Strait Point. Also the line’s newest ship Discovery Princess will be doing the same.

Royal Princess will now visit Haines instead of Skagway for the August 16 and August 30 sailings.

Discovery Princess will visit Sitka rather than Skagway on the cruises setting sail on August 11 September 8 and September 22 as will the Royal Princess cruise setting sail on September 13.

Carnival Removes Vaccine Requirement

It has been a long-awaited day for multiple Carnival-owned cruise brands including Carnival Cruise Line which will drop requirements on sailings.

Starting from departures on September 6 2022 vaccinated guests no longer have to undergo a pre-cruise test to sail. However guests will still need to show proof that they are fully vaccinated.

Carnival is also making a major change to its vaccine requirements which will open up cruises to more guests. Unvaccinated guests will be allowed to cruise and will no longer be required to show proof of vaccination before a cruise. However this does not apply to sailings in Australia or on voyages 16 nights and longer.

Unvaccinated guests or those who choose not to show vaccination proof will still need a negative PCR or antigen test result taken within three days before departure.

Carnival also says that for those guests that do have a pending vaccine exemption application and waiting for a response that booking is confirmed as long as the cruise is departing on or after September 6 and does not visit Canada Bermuda Australia or if the voyage is 16 nights or longer.

P&O Cruises and Cunard Drop Testing

Cunard Line and P&O Cruises are easing their requirements for sailings from September 6 2022 but only on shorter sailings where government regulations permit. In some embarkation ports stricter local guidelines will still apply.

For both lines testing for fully vaccinated passengers will become “highly recommended” rather than “required” as of Tuesday September 6.

Only on longer more “complex” sailings will guests still be required to present a negative antigen or PCR test to be permitted to board. While exact details on what constitutes a “complex” sailing have not yet been clarified the stricter requirements are likely to apply to itineraries 16 nights or longer as well as certain holiday sailings.

Regions with stricter local protocols at this time including Canada and Australia still require testing and guests booked on those sailings will be notified about their exact requirements for cruise travel.

To continue ensuring the health and wellbeing of guests and crew both Cunard Line and P&O Cruises still require all guests ages 16 and older to be fully vaccinated at least 14 days before embarkation. Crew members will also continue to be fully vaccinated and tested regularly.

The video game industry’s giants are heavily investing in this technology and hardware maker NVIDIA is one of the leading gaming entities in the Cloud Gaming space with its outstanding GeForce Now service.

NVIDIA GeForce Now is a subscription service that allows players to enjoy their games without needing beefy PCs or other gaming devices while providing crips and high-quality visuals. The service lets you play the games that you already own on other platforms like Steam Epic Games GOG and Ubisoft Play through the cloud and eliminates the need for downloads and updates.

Keeping up with Cloud Gaming’s fast-paced development can be difficult hence Mobidictum decided to reach out to an expert on the matter Nvidia’s Senior Product Manager Candice Mudrick and asked her queries about Cloud Gaming’s today and future. Candice also talked about the relationship between Cloud Gaming and Metaverse and how these two work together.

Cloud Gaming explained

Mobidictum’s Emre Can Kartal starts the interview with a simple question “If you were to introduce Cloud Gaming to a game developer who has never heard of it how would you describe it?

NVIDIA’s Cloud Gaming expert Mudrick gives a detailed yet simple and easy-to-grasp answer:

“For a game developer cloud gaming can expand the TAM of any game by making it available on a broader range of devices than it was originally designed for with relative ease. GeForce NOW can stream the full PC version of a game to any device that doesn’t meet the typical minimum spec system requirements for RAM HDD GPU or CPU whether that’s on desktop TV or mobile. “Cloud gaming also unlocks new user acquisition and marketing strategies. It can be used to let gamers instantly demo a game they may be interested in. Or let’s imagine that you’ve decided to download a game off Steam – you can start to play the game even before the download finishes. In another example it can provide easy access to a game’s prequel developed for a previous hardware generation boosting awareness for the upcoming title.

Mudrick then explains how Cloud Gaming services like GeForce Now can improve both developers’ and gamers’ experiences alike.

“Developers can also use cloud gaming for other use cases. GeForce NOW Cloud Playtest is just one of several developer tools built on GFN infrastructure enabling developers to manage content on the GFN service triage issues and move more of their game development workflow into the cloud.

“Such tools allow developers to upload game patches schedule deployments and debug issues via access to a game seat in the cloud. GFN Cloud Playtest virtualizes all aspects of testing a pre-released game with a set of external players: game build distribution scheduling playing and observing sessions are all performed via the cloud.

“Some cloud services like GeForce NOW also restrict user access to the server and game files which creates barriers to several typical forms of cheats and hacks– common challenge developers face.“

The experienced marketer also talks about what she thinks lies at the core of Cloud Gaming.

“GPUs latency-reducing innovations like Adaptive Vsync/NVIDIA Reflex high-speed networking; 5G/6G cloud & edge infrastructure and network optimizers and accelerators are all essentials for Cloud Gaming and its future.”

Can Cloud Gaming replace PC and consoles in the future?

At this point the same question that boggles the minds of many pops up in our brains too; if the future is all cloud gaming and whether building gaming rigs and investing in hardware is coming to an end. Emre Can becomes the voice of many and asks Candice “Which technologies are essential to the future of Cloud Gaming?“

She responds with the following words:

“Many in our community have already made the switch to GFN as their primary gaming platform. GeForce NOW especially the RTX 3080 membership offering streaming 1440p at 120 FPS has reached the point where many gamers report no discernable difference from playing on native hardware. “With a good internet connection it can be an even better experience than some native hardware like current-gen consoles connected to a TV – no downloads patches and hardware that’s updated on average every 2-3 years compared to once every 7 years. “There’s still a belief out there among some gamers that cloud gaming can’t be competitive with native hardware but Digital Foundry recently ran a latency test showing that the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 tier can even beat a native Xbox Series X. The streaming technology has come along at an astounding pace over the last few years.”

Mudrick however adds that Cloud Gaming’s goal isn’t to replace PC and consoles completely and mentions that a big part of the community enjoys building gaming rigs. She also adds that some people (a considerable amount too) want the absolute best experience they can achieve and that can’t be offered by Cloud Gaming just yet. She says:

“This does not mean that it will completely replace PCs and consoles. There are competitive gamers who need the absolute best performance and PC enthusiasts who have developed a very significant bond with their hardware. “For some building their own gaming rigs and keyboards is even the most important part of gaming. In the coming years cloud gaming is likely to continue its role as a parallel way of accessing games and be seen as an expansion of the ways one can play – on any device. The technology can even be integrated with current forms of gaming. For example older consoles can use cloud gaming to be able to play the latest-gen titles.”

GeForce Now Cloud Gaming and Metaverse

The Cloud Gaming expert talks about their recent collaborations with brands in and outside of the gaming space for metaverse-based projects and further explains how there’s no limit to what experiences can be achieved via the combined powers of Cloud and Metaverse.

“What we’ve done with GeForce NOW is build a global interactive content/graphics delivery platform – or in other words a metaverse access platform. GeForce NOW is optimized for gaming applications which are among the most challenging interactive consumer applications to stream. “Leveraging that expertise there’s no limit to any additional type of applications or metaverse experiences that could be hosted on GeForce NOW’s infrastructure. For example last year we streamed the interactive touch video short Disney’s Baymax Dreams of Fred’s Glitch. More recently we partnered with truck company DAF to deliver a virtual test drive experience via Euro Truck Simulator 2.“

She then introduces NVIDIA Omniverse “the world’s first simulation and collaboration platform that is delivering the foundation of the metaverse” and its benefits with the following comments:

“We’re also leveraging GeForce NOW for Omniverse. This year NVIDIA announced Omniverse Cloud a suite of cloud services for the Omniverse platform for 3D design collaboration and simulation. One of the Omniverse Cloud services is Nucleus Cloud which features Omniverse View an app for non-technical users to view Omniverse scenes streaming full simulation and rendering capabilities using the NVIDIA GeForce NOW platform.”

What awaits Cloud Gaming in the near future?

Emre Can addresses the elephant in the room then and asks for Candice’s expert opinion on what the future will bring in Cloud Gaming’s way and if it will become the main form of gaming. Candice gives a data-driven answer to our query.

“The future of cloud gaming is exciting! Newzoo forecasts that the cloud gaming market can reach $6.3 billion in global consumer spending by 2024. “Cloud gaming can democratize access to games by freeing players from expensive hardware requirements and we’ve seen incredible demand for it in countries like Brazil. We expect cloud gaming to continue growing its footprint around the world and we look forward to adding partners and new data centers in the future. “Never before have gamers had such extensive access to both a vast library of games they want to play and the hardware required to play them in just a few clicks (or taps). This ease of access will introduce GeForce gaming to the next billion gamers.”

To back up Candice’s data another reliable data provider DFC Intelligence expects Cloud Gaming to reach over $13 billion in revenue by 2026.

This situation occurs because the hardware sending visual data to your screen is inactive. Regardless the problem is purely a software issue and is entirely reversible by merely resetting the CMOS that controls the BIOS.

Depending on how comfortable you are with computers and how many peripherals are in the way the method for restoring your graphics card is going to seem either surprisingly simple or terrifyingly complex.

This article discusses ways to fix your disabled graphics card from the BIOS and the Windows OS depending on how you initially disabled it.

What is BIOS and CMOS?

BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System and it is the firmware on a chip that gets read first during boot plus it tells your computer what to do with each piece of hardware. The graphical user interface (GUI) will look like or similar to the following image:

The Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) acts as short-term memory which tells the BIOS what to do every time you start your computer. The CMOS generally appears in the RTC clock semiconductor but some motherboards have a separate chip.

For further information on the two check out the FAQ section.

Fixing a Graphics Card Disabled from BIOS

Option 1: Reset the BIOS using a Switch on Your Laptop or Desktop PC

Note: Resetting your computer’s BIOS only works if the GPU was disabled from BIOS. So skip ahead if you disabled it from the Windows Device Manager etc.

Most motherboards feature a CMOS reset switch which disconnects the backup battery’s power to the BIOS—it is a pin-and-plug setup. However it may use a button on some motherboards. If your board includes a reset switch it is easier to reset your CMOS and BIOS configuration.

The switch generally includes two or three pins.



1. Remove the plug then hold the power button for at least 20 seconds to drain residual energy. If your switch includes a third pin remove it and place it on the opposite outer one like the image above. Again press and hold the power button for at least 20 seconds.

2. Then reinsert the plug back in place or in the case of a three-pin setup place it back on the original outer pin.

By removing the plug from the pins the BIOS basically ‘forgets’ what settings to use at startup and reverts to its defaults. Don’t worry. None of your files or data get modified or deleted since they get stored on the HDD or SSD. Instead the computer goes back to its standard startup settings.

Option 2: Remove the CMOS Battery on Your Laptop or Desktop PC

Since this CMOS gets powered by a small battery (CR2032) the second BIOS reset option is to remove it.



Desktop CMOS Battery Removal

For desktop PCs CMOS battery removal is relatively straightforward: ensure your machine is powered down and remove all external cables then open up the case to reveal the hardware inside. If you’re unsure how to do this refer to the manufacturer’s information but be warned that doing so may void your warranty.

2. Once the internal components are accessible find and remove the CMOS battery which essentially looks like a large watch battery—usually located in an exposed housing on the motherboard. Once found pop the battery out but you may need to disengage some form of clipping mechanism first.



3. With the CMOS battery removed press and hold the power button for about 15 seconds to drain any residual power in the motherboard. This step should give the CMOS time to reset itself to its defaults.

4. Now reinsert the CMOS battery ensuring it gets inserted correctly.

5. Then reseal your computer’s case and reboot your machine. Your BIOS should have already reset itself re-enabling your internal graphics in the process.

Laptop CMOS Battery Removal

For laptop users accessing the CMOS battery could prove more challenging. Some models have a small pop-out tray on the chassis to enable easy removal similar to a DVD tray except much smaller in size—approximately one inch wide. If your laptop does not possess the tray feature (most do not) you will need to disassemble your “portable PC” to reach the battery housing.

Due to the wide variety of laptop makes and models in existence it’s impossible to provide a comprehensive guide to taking them all apart. The best way to find out how to disassemble your particular machine is to ascertain your laptop’s model number and then use a web search to locate a good tutorial or video.

Once you have access to the battery follow the steps above for desktop PCs: remove drain power replace and restart.





After you’ve rebooted your machine your BIOS should be back to normal with a functional screen.

If you still have issues after performing the steps above try replacing the CMOS battery with a new one.

Alternatively another option would be to take it to your local PC repair shop. Tell the staff that you need to reset the BIOS by removing the CMOS battery and often they will be happy to do it for you while you wait.

Fixing a Graphics Card Disabled in Windows

As mentioned if you disable your graphics card in Windows using the Device Manager or another app you’ll need to re-enable it by booting into Safe Mode.

Booting into Safe Mode

First boot your system in Safe Mode by holding the Shift + F8 key during startup. If the screen is working now which it should unless your graphics card has failed or you have a faulty screen cable or screen try re-enabling the graphics card. You should also update your system’s drivers. Furthermore restoring the PC to the factory defaults may fix your problems if it’s software related.

Again if you don’t see a display at all when first booting your PC (the BIOS splash screen) then you might have a more severe problem. The OS on your PC has no control over the boot screen so if you’ve tried everything else and don’t see anything you may have a faulty CPU or cable or graphics card.

Re-enable the Graphics Card

After Windows starts up open up the Device Manager. Now scroll down to Display adapters and click on it. Next right-click on your graphics card and select Enable Device if it’s disabled. You can now try restarting the computer to see if it worked or attempt to update the drivers. It’s often best to try one thing at a time and see if that resolves the issue.

Alternative Solutions

Many readers have expressed other black-screen issues on their PC or laptop so there are a few tips here for those who tried the steps above and have yet to correct their black-screen problem.

Connect Your Video Cable to the Onboard Graphics Card

You can use the onboard graphics card to temporarily solve the black-screen boot issue if you have a desktop. Connect your HDMI/VGA cable into the “onboard” video out (on the back of the PC) rather than the output from the PCI or PCIe slot. Many laptops also feature an onboard GPU but it is usually not suitable for gaming.

Clean Your Computer’s Internal Components and Connections

Next open your PC’s case and check for dust or debris in your motherboard. It may be as simple as a thorough cleaning to get your computer working correctly again.

Built-up dirt debris and oils from your skin can interfere with electrical signals around connections between components so it’s usually a good idea to regularly clean your computer and other devices.

Check with the Manufacturer

Lastly check with the component’s manufacturer for any information that is specific to your device (including personalized tech support and warranty). Use a search engine to find this information and reach out for additional help.

Sometimes a manufacturer doesn’t discover faulty designs for years so be sure to investigate thoroughly.

—–

In closing there are many things you can try to resolve your disabled graphics card problem. The most important thing to keep in mind is that you’ll have to re-enable it the same way you disabled it for example re-enable from BIOS if disabled in BIOS and re-enable from Windows if disabled in Windows.

Disabled/Black Screen GPU FAQs

What is the difference between CMOS and BIOS?

You may hear both CMOS and BIOS used interchangeably in certain circumstances such as resetting the BIOS and clearing the CMOS. The two are related but they are separate items.

The Basic Input Output System (BIOS) is firmware stored in a chip on the motherboard and it runs first during the boot process. The firmware tests the PC’s hardware and then launches the bootloader if more than one operating system exists or it opens the operating system installed whichever applies. The BIOS includes a graphical user interface (GUI) accessible by pressing a hotkey during bootup typically set as F2 F12 or Delete. Inside the GUI you find all hardware information and configuration options.

Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) got named after the manufacturing process for making electronic boards PC RAM and other peripheral boards. The CMOS in a PC is similar to RAM except it retains data when the PC is off plus it has a minimal capacity (usually 256 bytes). CMOS stores the data and time the boot sequence and disk drive information. The rest is stored and managed by the BIOS. Therefore the two items work together to boot your PC successfully.

My PC says ‘Graphics Card Not Detected.’ What does this mean and how do I fix it?

There are several reasons that your PC isn’t detecting your graphics card and therefore the screen does not work.

First if you’re using a desktop computer open the case and ensure that all connections are correctly fitted. A loose contact point can cause hardware failure.

Second ensure that you have the proper graphics settings. You may need to disable the onboard GPU and reset it.

Third you could have a power supply issue so check that your computer pulls enough power to run the graphics card. If you’ve recently installed or upgraded your graphics card you’ll need to install drivers for it.

Aside from these options you could have another connection issue maybe Windows needs a software update or you have a faulty graphics card or motherboard.

What is the Blue Screen of Death? Is it because of my Graphics Card?

The BSOD occurs based on a malfunction on Windows PCs where either the software or the hardware prevents your system from booting or running correctly. This situation can undoubtedly arise due to the graphics card drivers software or another piece of hardware within your machine. You will need to research your problem to narrow down the cause.

Windows operating systems usually need to shut down after experiencing a BSOD but the display provides an error code first (usually words). You’ll need to cross-reference that error code to find out where the problem is so that you can fix it. If you have a warranty on your computer call the manufacturer."

For Rodgers the four-time NFL MVP in his 18th year his current station in football life has rendered playing in preseason no longer worth the risk. (Although head coach Matt LaFleur might play him in the finale.)

But Rodgers hadn’t forgotten what it was like to be Love the team’s 2020 first-round draft pick in his third year and the screwball things quarterbacks have to deal with in exhibition play.

And lo and behold with Rodgers on the Levi’s Stadium sideline in street clothes and wearing a coach’s headset and Love playing the first half of Friday night’s 28-21 loss in Santa Clara Calif. the good bad and ugly Rodgers was anticipating unfolded during the 46 snaps Love played.

From his touchdown pass to rookie sensation Romeo Doubs to the two interceptions he threw that went off his receiver’s hands before being picked to his third interception that came when he forced a ball he might not have if his targets had run the correct routes Love’s night certainly wasn’t uneventful.

“We say it all the time about quarterbacks: They’re going to get too much credit when we do well and they’re going to get a lot of the blame when we don’t” LaFleur told reporters afterward. “That’s just the reality of playing that position in this league.

“But I was pleased with Jordan’s performance.”

Given Love’s stat line — 13 of 24 for 176 yards with two touchdowns and those three INTs for a passer rating of 66.0 — that might sound like a coach putting a positive spin on his young QB’s otherwise rough night.

But it wasn’t. And Rodgers can explain why.

With all the extenuating circumstances that are part-and-parcel with preseason action — mistaken routes to be run blocks to be missed physical and mental mistakes aplenty — both Rodgers and Love knew that the best-laid plans of head coaches and offensive coordinators were unlikely to be executed as hoped.

And so Rodgers emphasized trying to play within the confines of the play-call — as much as possible — was still important even if things were likely to go haywire.

“The ‘scrutinizers’ want to see movement and points and scoring drives for sure. (But) I believe the coaches would want to see perfection in execution” Rodgers said in advance of the game. “That comes from a mastery of the system. I think that’s the most important thing.

“Sometimes we get caught up in big plays or points on a drive. Those are great and those feel good but the most important thing is you’re making the right check you’re making the right adjustment you’re getting us in and out of the huddle and commanding the operation.

“Preseason football is different. You’re out there a lot of times with young guys some wild stuff happens. Some guys miss blocks and guys run the wrong way. Obviously there’s an art to making that work but the most important thing is a mastery of the position because that shows the coaches and your guys that you’re ready to go.

“Again practice is very important and you need to show a mastery in practice as well. The games there’s some survival to it. Obviously you want to score points but I think it still comes down to are you showing the staff that you have the mastery of all things quarterback.”

And while “mastery” is surely still a ways off for Love whose NFL game-playing resume now consists of 112 total preseason snaps 131 regular season snaps and 121 combined pass attempts Love certainly showed LaFleur some of the things he and the Packers coaching and scouting staffs wanted to see from him.

The best results were obvious: Love’s two 33-yard touchdown passes — a first-quarter fourth-and-2 touchdown strike to Doubs against a blitz and a second-quarter back-shoulder ball to ex-University of Wisconsin standout Danny Davis just before halftime.

In between were Love’s three picks — one that caromed off tight end Tyler Davis’ hands one that was wrested away from Doubs and one that Love shouldn’t have thrown across the middle when two of his receivers botched their assigned routes.

“It’s never perfect for a quarterback but I thought by and large just watching the things like how the operation was it was a smooth operation” LaFleur said. “I thought he got us in and out of the huddle extremely crisp and with urgency. I thought he made some off-schedule plays. I thought he showed some nice athleticism on a couple of those runs as well. So there were a lot of good things out there from Jordan.

“Just the poise that he showed in the pocket that’s something we’re looking at. Overall I thought it was a pretty good first step for him.”

More importantly it gave Love quarterbacks coach Tom Clements offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich and LaFleur all kinds of teaching tape heading into this week’s joint practices with the New Orleans Saints before next Friday’s second preseason game against them.

“One of my old coaches would always tell me ‘It’s never as good as you think it is and it’s never as bad as you think it is until you watch it on film’” Love said admitting that his offensive coordinator at Utah State David Yost didn’t exactly invent that cliché. “With ‘12’ right there you see him every day and how consistent he is and that’s where I’m trying to get to — continue to grow and be consistent every day.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcmFjaW5nbmV3cy5jby8yMDIyLzA4LzEzL25vcnRoLXNvdXRoLTEwMC1yZXN1bHRzLWF1Z3VzdC0xMy0yMDIyLTc1ay10by13aW4tbG9sbWRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North South 100 Results: August 13 2022 - $75k to win (LOLMDS),"Tonight the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series unloads in Union KY.

Grand Canyon University in Phoenix Arizona is turning into Old Dominion West for the Chicago Cubs. Last year the Cubs took reliever Frankie Scalzo off the Antelopes’ roster in the draft along with free agent Catcher David Avitia while also selecting his brother Daniel who was committed to Grand Canyon. David wound up becoming a grad assistant coach rather than sticking with the Cubs. This year the Cubs took GCU’s Friday night starter Nick Hull who was actually the set up man for Scalzo in 21.

Basic Information

Height – 6-foot

Weight – 205 lbs.

Throws – Right

From – Grand Canyon University

Age – 22

7th round 2022 MLB Draft

Nick Hull throws in the low to mid 90s and he has a plus slider with a spin rate of over 3000 RPM. That’ll get you drafted. As for what role he’s going to have that is going to remain to be seen.

Hull first started playing for Grand Canyon in 2018 and he appeared in 17 games eight which he started. The ERA was 7.61 that year and he improved on it a lot for 2019 as he got it down to 3.98 in 21 games only three of which she started.

For Hull 2018 was a turning point in his Antelope career. Here’s what he told the Grand Canyon University website.

“The failure that I had early on is really what helped me get here. It taught me that I’m not going to be the best player on the team right now and that if I want to be then I have to put in more work than everyone else. I’d always been a hard worker but it didn’t occur to me what hard work really was until I got to college.”

In 2020 and 2021 Hull was back in the bullpen full-time and he had a 2.08 ERA in 2019 and in 2020 he posted a 1.77 ERA. He returned for a fifth year this spring as a starter and a grad student. He made 16 starts with a 3.72 ERA and struck out 102 batters in the spring.

8 strikeouts in 5 2/3 frames of work from GCU Graduate Senior Nick Hull. With all 8 K's on the slider this is your pitch of the day. Mostly 80-82 with the offering w/ spin rate creeping over 3000. @PGCollegeball @GCU_Baseball @PG_Scouting @PitchingNinja pic.twitter.com/sjD5YVXP43 — Perfect Game California (@California_PG) March 5 2022

It’s all Nick Hull through five innings of work. 👏 #LopesUp pic.twitter.com/4YkyAsr9cq — GCU Baseball (@GCU_Baseball) May 27 2022

I actually like this pick a lot. When next season starts he’s going to be 23 and there’s some flexibility about how the Cubs could use him. Depending upon his throwing program/individual development plan he could add a little something-something to his fastball as well as develop a third pitch to that complements his fastball and slider.

More than likely where he goes to start 2023 really depends upon if he’s going to be a starter or a reliever. If he’s going to be in relief South Bend all the way. If he’s going to start Myrtle Beach might be the best location as there’s probably going to be a little bit of a log jam at South Bend and Tennessee next year.

On August 9 President Joe Biden signed into law the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act enacting a major legislative package that will provide $280 billion in federal funding to encourage the domestic production of semiconductor products in the United States as well as fund research and development projects in advanced technological fields like quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Although the 1000+ page bill establishes massive investments into several areas of developing technologies it focuses very little on the intellectual property rights that are critical for protecting the new technologies that would be developed through federally funded projects.

Schumer Amendments Beef Up CHIPS Act with Billions in Science Funding

A fact sheet issued by the White House on the day President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law notes that the bill creates a $52.7 billion fund to support semiconductor R&D manufacturing and workforce development within the United States. The new law also provides for a $10 billion investment into the development of regional innovation and technology hubs and establishes other programs supporting science technology engineering and math (STEM) educational programs.

Since first being introduced as the CHIPS for America Act in June 2020 the bill has taken a circuitous path toward its enactment into law. After being subsumed by the sprawling U.S. Innovation and Competition Act that was passed by the U.S. Senate in June 2021 before complications arose with the House version of the bill the provisions of the CHIPS for America Act took on a new life this summer. Both lawmakers and industry leaders called upon Congress in recent months to pass the legislation in an effort to secure critical semiconductor supply chains in the face of the global chip shortage. Amendments made by Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) included major expansions to the science-related provisions of the bill leading up to a cloture vote in the Senate and the bill sailed through the U.S. House of Representatives before ending on President Biden’s desk.

The CHIPS and Science Act especially the provisions aimed at promoting domestic manufacturing and R&D programs was advanced in large part due to lawmakers’ concerns over China’s efforts to become a dominant technological force in the global economy. Indeed both Chinese state media outlets and government officials have publicly excoriated the United States’ passage of the bill calling America’s efforts to isolate China from global tech development regressive and evidence of a “growing lack of self-confidence” in America’s ability to compete fairly.

Tech Transfer Provisions Focus Primarily on Clean Energy R&D

While the CHIPS and Science Act delivers a major windfall of federal funding into important sectors of tech development there is precious little attention paid to IP rights for protecting the technologies that result from federally-funded R&D projects. In all the 1054-page bill mentions “technology transfer” a total of 36 times “intellectual property” is mentioned 27 times and the word “patent” appears only four times throughout this enormous legislative package.

Many of the bill’s technology transfer provisions are situated within Title VI of the CHIPS and Science Act labeled “Miscellaneous Science and Technology Provisions.” Subtitle J of Title VI titled “Energizing Technology Transfer” primarily focuses upon promoting technological development in the clean energy sector. Much of this particular language was adopted into the CHIPS and Science Act from the Energizing Technology Transfer Act which was introduced in July 2021 by Representatives Deborah Ross (D-NC) and Peter Meijer (R-MI). That bill was focused on promoting technologies that would address climate change explaining why many of the tech transfer provisions of the bill are limited to that technological field.

The Energizing Technology Transfer subtitle of the CHIPS and Science Act includes three parts. The first part establishes several programs including a national clean energy incubator program that would facilitate a total of $95 million over five years in funding for state tech incubators university students pursuing advances in clean energy and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) activities coordinating activities among relevant governmental tech transfer programs. Part two of Subtitle J sets aside more than $260 million for supporting technology development at national laboratories through establishment of a lab partnering service pilot program a lab-embedded entrepreneurship program and a small business voucher program. The third part of this subtitle earmarks another $100 million for appointing personnel within the DOE’s Office of Technology Transitions and updates reporting and evaluation requirements for the DOE’s tech transfer programs.

Bill Addresses IP Theft But Could Have Facilitated More Innovation Faster

Beyond this section of the CHIPS and Science Act references to patents and IP rights are very lightly salted throughout the bill’s language. Intellectual property receives a few mentions within Section 10114 of Title I in language directed at mitigating research security risks encountered by R&D programs supported by the bill and determining the risk of having IP stolen by adversaries in foreign countries. Title III labeled National Science Foundation for the Future contains a few provisions designed to ensure that intellectual property and research from projects funded by the NSF through funding authorized by the bill. Statutory language in this title establishes a Directorate for Technology Innovation and Partnerships (TIP) under the NSF and authorizes $20 billion to fund this new entity. In granting research awards TIP is directed to consider projects that “advanc[e] novel approaches and reduc[e] barriers to technology transfer including through intellectual property frameworks… and approaches to technology transfer for applications with public benefit that may not rely on traditional commercialization tools.”

Given how the public interest has been cited to support waivers of international patent rights to COVID-19 vaccines it seems fair to question whether less reliance on “traditional commercialization tools” on technologies having public benefits translates into a preference for projects that actively disavow patent rights. However NSF funding through TIP will also be used to establish a series of Regional Innovation Engines that in part will provide some reimbursements for patent and licensing activities and develop entrepreneurship training seminars that include information about patents.

Despite its occasional nods to IP the CHIPS and Science Act appears to have little interest in intellectual property and patent rights when stronger statutory language could have done more to advance the legislation’s core goals. The bill’s drafters could have considered the establishment of a prioritized patent application program for eligible tech developers at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the way that the agency has itself established in the past in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for example. With billions in taxpayer money being distributed under this new law it would have been nice to see D.C. lawmakers show some understanding of the importance of patents and licensing in supporting American innovators and creating domestic economic growth.

It is disturbing for global supply chains to see the US apply increasing administrative intervention in normal market competition when it comes to advanced technology areas such as semiconductors.The US announced new export controls on four emerging and foundational technologies that support the production of advanced semiconductors and gas turbine engine according to an interim final rule released on Friday by the US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).While the BIS didn't name China directly observers generally believe that the move is mainly aimed at further decoupling semiconductor supply chains of China and the US marking the first semiconductor-related move after US President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law.For the CHIPS Act and US-promoted ""chip alliance"" they are all about boosting the US chip manufacturing capabilities while politicizing the semiconductor industry to exclude China from the global industrial chain.No one can ignore the strong intention the US is now showing to wage a ""chip war"" against China especially after Washington threw a set of punches designed to strangle China's technological development.The semiconductor industry has become a recent focus of the China-US geopolitical competition which is provoked by the US. But the coercive approach of forcing companies or economies to take sides between China and the US is problematic and poses a serious threat to the security of the global supply chain. This is because chips are the product of global collaboration and the formation and development of the semiconductor industrial chain is the result of the interaction based on market rule.If the US is intended to decouple itself from China in a ""chip war"" it will have to rope in other allies to form a technological iron curtain that effectively end up splitting the current global supply chain into two. Yet it is highly questionable whether the US has the ability to pull the whole world into its ""chip war."" In fact even the long-brewing CHIPS Act has faced questions on its effectiveness and sustainability not to mention other export control measures.More importantly the US may want to curb the development of China's semiconductor sector by imposing various restrictions but this may only lead to more supply chain disruptions. As the US becomes increasingly accustomed to abusing various export controls and restrictions it is actually sabotaging its own supply chain by inviting more risks.If Washington is determined to keep the so-called ""chip war"" going it must be ready for China to fight back.China uses a large number of chips to manufacture end products like electronics and auto parts and a large amount of the final products are exported to the rest of the world including the US. If the US continues its suppression on the supplies of semiconductor-related products and technologies to China it may eventually contribute to disruption in the manufacturing sector which will not only affect China but also weigh down the US supply chain.Given the scale and capacity of Chinese manufacturing there is no other country that can replace China's role which is why a decoupling from China for US semiconductor supply chain is impossible."

Prince Alwaleed’s investment firm Kingdom Holding Co. acquired depositary receipts issued by Gazprom PSJC Lukoil PJSC and Rosneft PJSC in February according to a stock exchange filing. Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

No specific dates for the investments were given and the Saudi firm didn’t respond to questions about whether it still owned them. The value of all those depositary receipts dropped rapidly after the war began when trading in Moscow was halted and western sanctions were imposed on Russia.

Alwaleed whose grandfather was the founder of modern Saudi Arabia is one of the country’s richest men and most high profile international investors. More recently he has been eclipsed by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund chaired by his cousin Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman which acquired a 16.9% stake in Kingdom Holding Co. in May.

Prince Alwaleed was also detained at the Saudi capital’s Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2017 along with other princes and government officials as part of what the state called an anti-corruption probe. No formal charges were ever presented and he was released after 83 days having reached an undisclosed “confirmed understanding” with the government.

Kingdom Holding invested 1.37 billion riyals ($365 million) in Gazprom’s American depositary receipts in February the biggest stake of those disclosed so far this year. It also invested 196 million riyals in Rosneft’s global depositary receipts the same month and 410 million riyals in Lukoil’s American depositary receipts between February and March.

Other investments

Kingdom Holding invested $3.4 billion in global equities and depositary receipts since 2020 based on the filing a rare bit of disclosure by the company. The largest stake was an investment valued at 2.5 billion riyals in Spain’s Telefonica SA between April to August 2020.

It also disclosed stakes in Uber Technologies Inc. TotalEnergies SE Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and BHP Group Ltd. acquired mostly in 2020 and 2021. The most recent deal it disclosed was a 178 million riyal stake in Hercules Capital Inc. made in June. The venture capital firm’s shares have risen 17% since the start of July.

Prince Alwaleed 67 became one of the highest profile Saudi investors after taking stakes in companies such as Citigroup Inc. and Apple Inc. He’s supported Prince Mohammed’s modernization efforts including giving women the right to drive.

More recently he’s announced the sale of a stake in his Rotana Music label to Warner Music Group Corp. and he raised $2.2 billion by selling part of his stake in the Four Seasons hotel chain to Bill Gates’ Cascade Investment LLC.

Alwaleed is known for long-term investments and is a fan of famed investor Warren Buffett. He once called himself the Oracle of Omaha’s Arabian equivalent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZWV2ZC5mYS51czYub3JhY2xlY2xvdWQuY29tL2hjbVVJL0NhbmRpZGF0ZUV4cGVyaWVuY2UvZW4vc2l0ZXMvQ1hfMTEwMDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HNP San Francisco/Bay Area Careers,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1bXBzdGFydG1hZy5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy1hLXBvaXNvbi1waWxsLXN0cmF0ZWd5LTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding the Hard-To-Swallow Pill in the Business World: What Is a Poison Pill Strategy?,"The poison pill makes a takeover less appealing by making it more expensive.

The events following Elon Musk announcing his plans to buy Twitter in April have been quite a fiasco. Earlier this month Musk said he was backing out of the US$44 billion bid leading to Twitter suing him over the deal. It surely was an interesting turn of events after Twitter imposed a “poison pill” strategy against Musk’s potential takeover in April. Back then Musk proposed taking the company private at US$54.2 per share which was 38% higher than Twitter’s stock value before the announcement of the plan.

The poison pill move was widely seen as a direct shot across the bow of the Tesla CEO who has been a vocal critic of the social media platform. It stipulates that other shareholders can acquire additional shares at cheaper prices if someone holds beneficial ownership of at least 15 percent of Twitter’s outstanding common stock without the board’s authorization. This would have limited Musk’s access to control through share purchases.

Poison pills are common in the business world to fend off buyout attempts. In 2012 Netflix imposed one to foil the takeover plan of Carl Icahn Founder of Icahn Enterprises after he had purchased a 10% stake in the company. In 2018 Papa John’s Pizza went for a poison pill against John Schnatter the founder of the pizza chain and former chairman. He still owned 30% of the company after resigning his post for using a racial slur during a conference call. Other big corporations like Yahoo and Sotheby’s have also turned to this move as well. Read on to learn more about this strategy and the different types of poison pills.

What is a poison pill?

Devised in 1982 by a mergers and acquisition lawyer in New York Martin Lipton the poison pill also known as the shareholder rights plan is a defense strategy that a company utilizes to prevent or discourage a hostile acquisition. This technique makes the company seem less appealing to prospective acquirers. It became popular in the 70s during a wave of hostile takeovers raiding corporate boards by financiers like T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.

It was first tested in a lawsuit filed by oil firm General American Oil to prevent the attempted takeover by T. Boone Pickens. Lipton advised the company’s Board of Directors to dilute Pickens’ stock purchases by flooding the market with new shares. The board turned down the offer due to concerns over the strategy’s legality and Philips Petroleum bought it out last-minute. It was not after the 1985 landmark ruling of the Delaware Supreme Court in Moran vs. Household International Inc. that the “poison pill” became famous for fighting off unwanted takeover attempts.

Two common types of poison pills

Flip-in poison pill

A flip-in poison pill which Twitter used against Musk’s buyout is a type of tactic which allows all shareholders (except for the acquiring company) to buy additional shares of the target company at a discounted price before the success of a takeover bid.

Although this gives the shareholders immediate profits the new shares will dilute the shares owned by the acquiring firm or investor making it more difficult and costly for the acquirer to gain control. The flip-in tactic is only implemented when the acquirer has acquired at least 20–50% of outstanding shares.

Another company besides Twitter that adopted this was PeopleSoft Inc a company founded by David Duffield and specialized in human resource management systems. In 2004 PeopleSoft implemented the flip-in poison pill tactic against software giant Oracle Corporation allowing new shares to flood the market. It also established a “customer assurance program” under which it promised to reimburse customers up to five times the software costs if the company stopped developing its products after acquisition.

Although PeopleSoft was eventually acquired by Oracle in December 2004 its anti-takeover strategy paid off for its shareholders. Oracle purchased PeopleSoft for US$10.3 billion doubling its initial offer.

Flip-over poison pill

Meanwhile a flip-over poison pill strategy allows existing shareholders of the target company to purchase the acquiring company’s shares at a discount if/when the takeover attempt is successful.

Such a strategy will discourage the acquirers as the shares of the acquiring firm’s existing shareholders become diluted with the purchase. This kind of provision intends to transfer money from the stakeholders of the acquiring firm to those of the target firm.

In most situations the flip-over approach does not completely prevent a takeover. Usually it results in the acquirer canceling its hostile takeover plans to avoid stock dilution and coming up with a more friendly proposal.

Is a poison pill worth it?

While it appears that a poison pill plan can work in deterring hostile coups it is not 100% effective and risk-free. In some cases the strategy can backfire.

When new shares are issued at a discount the stock’s value is altered forcing existing shareholders to purchase more shares in order to keep their original stake. Additionally implementing a poison pill may be both time-consuming and costly in terms of the actual strategy and the company’s reputation. Moreover poison pills can discourage investments from institutional investors like Foreign Direct Investors (FDIs) and Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs).

At the end of the day a poison pill is a last resort strategy that requires thorough consideration. The outcome can be rather complicated such as in the case of Musk’s Twitter buyout deal. Although the plan seems to be off the table now both parties will likely to be in the headlines for a while until the legal battle between them is settled with Twitter reportedly hiring Lipton’s firm to sue Musk.

At the time of writing Apple Microsoft Alphabet and Amazon are the only four U.S. companies with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or greater. Tesla is not far behind with a market cap of $907 million.

These are elite businesses that have earned shareholders tremendous gains. It goes without saying that these companies all had much smaller market caps not too long ago. Amazon's market cap was $105 billion exactly 10 years ago.

Generally a good place to look for the next home-run stocks are growing companies with a market cap between $100 billion to $500 billion. But in this case let's first look at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) which has a higher market cap but could be a timely buy right now.

For higher return prospects you'll want to consider Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.31%) and Salesforce (CRM 0.55%). These are solid growth stories that still have years to play out.

1. Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway is one of the safest stocks you can hold for the long term. After rising 50% over the last five years it carries a market cap of $653 billion. That puts it within shooting distance of the $1 trillion milestone. There are a few reasons Berkshire will keep growing in value.

Berkshire has a sterling balance sheet with $122 billion of cash and fixed securities. The company has a large stock portfolio worth $327 billion at the end of the second quarter. Buffett's investment vehicle holds large stakes in Apple Bank of America and Coca-Cola among other stocks. Buffett has most recently been adding to large stakes in Chevron Occidental Petroleum and leading PC brand HP (formerly Hewlett-Packard).

Another piece of Berkshire's intrinsic value is its dozens of privately held businesses. The company's subsidiaries span everything from candy to railroads. It also owns several insurance companies that provide $147 billion in float or money that Berkshire collects from insurance premiums that it can reinvest in stocks bonds or acquisitions. Many of these Berkshire-held businesses tend to be immune from the changes in technology which adds a degree of predictability to their long-term performance -- something Buffett no doubt considered.

One of Buffett's best stock ideas lately has been Berkshire Hathaway itself. Through the first half of 2022 he bought $4 billion worth of the company's shares -- a sign that Buffett sees the stock as undervalued. The stock's price has tripled over the last decade and could repeat that return which would push Berkshire's market cap over $1 trillion by 2032.

2. Advanced Micro Devices

Owning companies that serve megatrends in technology such as spending on data centers cloud computing and other advanced computing needs could pay off big. Advanced Micro Devices has emerged as a key supplier of high-performance chips in these markets.

AMD currently sports a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23 based on 2022 earnings estimates and has a market cap of $159 billion. To reach $1 trillion in 10 years the share price needs to climb at a compound annual rate of 20%. That is achievable for this fast-growing chipmaker.

For a long time AMD was the underdog in the semiconductor industry. It's always played the role of a low-cost alternative to leaders like Intel and Nvidia but not anymore.

While AMD is still way behind Intel in central processing units (CPUs) and Nvidia in graphics processing units (GPUs) it is winning over customers with its renewed focus on designing high-performance chips. Data center operators are now looking at AMD's Epyc server chips as a viable alternative to Intel. In the last quarter AMD again gained market share over its CPU rival. Revenue grew 70% year over year in the second quarter driven by strong growth in data center chips and consumer chips for notebooks and gaming.

The data center accelerator market which includes spending on CPUs and GPUs is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 34% through 2027 reaching $75 billion. AMD just completed the acquisition of Xilinx a leading supplier of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips which fills out its product lineup to tackle this enormous opportunity. The strong tailwind in the data center market along with AMD's modest valuation could deliver market-beating returns to investors over the long term.

There is a reason why AMD CEO Lisa Su is considered one of the top business leaders right now. Su has done a marvelous job guiding this underdog to industry leadership and its best days are still ahead.

3. Salesforce

The name Salesforce doesn't sound like a growth tech stock that is worthy of the elite club of $1 trillion companies but every investor should know about this amazing business.

Former Oracle executive Marc Benioff co-founded Salesforce in 1999 and currently serves as the company's chairman and co-CEO. Salesforce pioneered the software-as-a-service business model. Companies save money by subscribing to Salesforce's cloud-based software which lowers in-house expenses by maintaining installing and keeping systems updated.

Salesforce has grown tremendously and has been ranked the No. 1 customer relationship management (CRM) software provider for nine years. Its flagship product is the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Customer 360 platform which offers a suite of software that helps companies manage sales marketing and e-commerce and it continues to expand into new categories.

It has reinvested its growing profitability into strategic acquisitions that expand its offering and competitive lead in the market. Last year it acquired Slack Technologies which offers a communication platform for employees for $27 billion.

What's most remarkable about Salesforce is its consistency which speaks volumes about the size of its long-term growth opportunity. After two decades of high revenue growth Salesforce is still growing quarterly revenue over 20% year over year.

It generated $27 billion in revenue over the last four quarters but the total addressable market for the company's services is expected to reach $284 billion by 2026 according to Gartner Research. It can grow for a long time. However if Salesforce continues its record of strategic acquisitions its addressable market could widen even more as it expands its product offering.

With a market cap of $189 billion Salesforce is well on its way toward $1 trillion. It has the industry leadership and massive market opportunity to deliver market-beating returns to investors.

The primary objective was to showcase Kenworth’s readiness for fast-approaching zero-emissions engine requirements. Its T680E currently in production is the truck maker’s answer to Class 8 battery-electric vehicle (BEV) requirements and with a 150-mile range is well suited for pickup-and-delivery (P&D) drayage and regional applications.

It boasts a top speed of 70 mph with a 536 hp motor that produces 1623 lb.-ft. of torque. It carries a 395-kWh battery pack and has a GVWR of 82000 lb. It can be configured as a 6×4 tractor or straight truck with 190-inch wheel base and an industry-standard CCS1 charge port.

Range has become a point of contention when discussing battery-electric trucks. But it’s important to remember the main influencer of range is battery capacity. Don’t expect one Class 8 electric truck to greatly outperform another in terms of range if they carry the same battery capacity. Sure aerodynamics can have some small effect but the biggest influencer is battery capacity and it would be nice to see some standard calculation used to report electric vehicle range. Maybe that’ll come in time.

Back to the trucks. That T680E was whisper-quiet on the track and later on the roads around the Paccar Technical Center in Mount Vernon Wash. I had to reference a small icon on the driver display to ensure the truck was turned on when I climbed behind the wheel. Torque came instantly when I applied the throttle – but it always does with electric trucks. Having driven a few I asked Kenworth’s chief engineer Joe Adams how Kenworth plans to differentiate itself in an electric vehicle world when all electric powertrains I’ve driven share more or less the same operating characteristics – instant torque low noise and lack of diesel smell.

“It’s the subtle things that really matter” he said. By that he’s referring in part to NVH – or noise vibration and harshness. Electric motors are so quiet you begin to hear noises in the cab that were previously drowned out by the rumble of a diesel engine. Adams said Kenworth has spent a great deal of time focused on this and that statement proved true out on the road. The cab interior was remarkably quiet – no squeaks or rattles to speak of inside the day cab.

Another differentiator for Kenworth is the type of batteries used. Alec Cervenka Kenworth’s zero-emissions sales manager said the industry standard batteries are nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) – the same used in passenger cars but scaled up for commercial applications. Cervenka said Kenworth opted for a lithium-ion phosphate battery he said is more durable and boasts a longer useful life eight to 10 years before degradation compared to the five to six years he says NMC batteries provide. He also said they’re less likely to puncture and combust in the event of a wreck.

The company also believes the fit and finish Kenworth has been known for in its traditional models will allow it to continue differentiating itself in a BEV world.

On the road the Kenworth T680E is a fun truck to drive. Once you can master the regenerative braking it becomes rarely necessary to use the brakes so potential maintenance savings are obvious. Regenerative braking acts much like a supercharged engine brake putting power back into the battery pack when the throttle is released. Stephan Olsen general sales manager with Kenworth said BEVs reduce energy costs by upwards of 50% on top of maintenance savings and associated downtime.

I also had the chance to drive Kenworth’s T270E a Class 6 BEV cabover intended for P&D or last mile delivery applications. While there wasn’t a T370E available to drive the two models cover Classes 6 and 7 applications with 100-200 mile ranges (depending on whether it has the available 141 or 282 kWh battery pack) 469 hp/2540 lb.-ft. torque wheelbases from 206-274 inches and GVWRs ranging from 26000 to 33000 lb.

These trucks can typically be operated eight to 10 hours a day and would return home at the end of a driving shift for charging. Kenworth works closely with customers to choose the right charging solution for the application and Paccar Financial can finance the complete package. The company also has experts available to seek out government incentives that can help offset the cost.

“It’s really important we’re not just giving them a truck we’re giving them a whole solution” Adams said of electric vehicle customers.

Much like it’s larger sibling ‘fun’ is the best descriptor I can use for driving the T270E. The smaller size of the truck means it is zippy with an immediate throttle response and regenerative braking that will thrust the driver forward when letting off the pedal until it can be mastered which doesn’t take long.

Certainly some driver training and orientation will be required but it doesn’t take long to get acclimated to driving an electric truck. A package delivery driver making dozens of stops per day will enjoy this truck and finish the day feeling less fatigued from the constant noise braking and smells associated with traditional diesels.

Hydrogen for longhaul

A Class 8 Kenworth T680FCEV (fuel-cell-electric) was also among the trucks available to drive and this one was a highlight as it was my first time driving a hydrogen-fueled truck. With a range of 300-500 miles (480-800 km) hydrogen is widely expected to be the emissions-free answer to longhaul transport needs.

Kenworth worked with Toyota to build 10 hydrogen-fueled day cabs that have been deployed at the Port of Los Angeles in California for the last two years. As that project comes to an end this summer they’ll be used as demonstration units in other parts of the country.

These prototypes have a range of 300 miles top speed of 70 mph put out 560 hp and can be refueled in 15 minutes (a big advantage over BEVs). They carry a 12-kWh battery pack which helps get the truck up to speed; hydrogen is most efficient at speed not getting there. They have a GVWR of 82000 lb. and payload of 45000 lb. The hydrogen tanks were mounted to the back of the cab.

If hydrogen is the future of longhaul transport I asked if sleeper cabs will be viable. That space was occupied by the hydrogen tanks on the T680FCEV I drove. Adams said these trucks were specifically designed for drayage applications and that sleepers will indeed be possible through different tank configurations much like Kenworth builds CNG-powered sleeper trucks today.

I expected the hydrogen T680 to drive much like the T680E but that wasn’t the case. The regenerative braking is less noticeable since the battery pack onboard is so much smaller. The ride was louder since the electric motor sits directly underneath the cab where the T680E uses electric axles located far enough behind the driver to be completely soundless inside the cab.

But the torque was there the whine of the electric motor was still quieter than the rumble of a diesel and most importantly – emissions are non-existent. And this is still very much an early-stage prototype so production models of the future will look and sound different yet I’m sure.

The classics

ZEVs are fun and exciting. But there’s still something to be said for a long-hood classic-styled diesel truck in certain applications and for the immediate future before regulators regulate them out of existence.

Kenworth still maintains a presence in this segment and recently developed a 52-inch flat-roof sleeper cab for its Models T680 T880 T880S and W990. I got to drive a W990 with this configuration which is ideal for applications requiring a low ride height (car haulers and cranes to name a couple) or for owner-operators who don’t live out of the truck but need a sleeper for the occasional overnighter.

Kenworth achieved the lower ride height (104.5 inches from ground to roof) by dropping the front axle five inches and using the AG400L rear suspension with 6.5-inch ride height. The sleeper has an interior height of 55.5 inches. You can’t stand up in it but can get a comfortable sleep install a TV store stuff under the bunk and get dressed while sitting on the bed.

The W990 with 52-inch flat roof sleeper I drove came equipped with the new Paccar TX-18 automated manual transmission which offered quick precise shifts and powerful engine braking on the road. The 18-speed transmission can be mated to Paccar MX-11 and MX-13 engines. It has three reverse gears while the new TX-18 Pro has six. I also drove a W990 heavy-haul day cab with TX-18 Pro transmission. I see this truck being a good fit in Canada’s oilpatch which is finally showing signs of life.

Both TX-18 transmissions can handle GVWRs up to 140000 lb and have equal steps between gears and lengthy service intervals of 500000 miles (800000 km) or five years on-highway and 250000 miles (400000 kms)/three years in vocational applications. The TX-18 is best suited to on-highway applications while the TX-18 Pro can handle some severe-service and off-road duties as well.

The TX-series transmissions are available for order now with production set to begin in the fourth quarter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb2dwcmVzdG9uLmNvLnVrLzIwMjIvMDgvcHJlc3Rvbi1ib29tcy1kdWUtdG8td29ybGQtd2FyLWlpLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24v0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvZ3ByZXN0b24uY28udWsvMjAyMi8wOC9wcmVzdG9uLWJvb21zLWR1ZS10by13b3JsZC13YXItaWktcHJvZHVjdGlvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Preston booms due to World War II production,"Preston in 1930 Pic: Preston Digital Archive

Recovery from the great depression of the 1930s was boosted due to the the effects of the wartime investment boom in Preston and district. This investment in new factory capacity still has benefits that continue to this day.

Deflation not inflation the depression eases

Inflation is not a new thing. After the crash of 1929 unemployment rocketed however deflation not inflation occurred with purchasing power increasing by 3 per cent. Unfortunately inflation took off again and was 3.75 per cent by 1937. During World War II it peaked at 16 per cent.

Unemployment in Preston was 6578 by December 1937 and Britain’s world trade fell by half between 1929 and 1933.

By 1936 the depression was easing however war clouds were on the horizon and this year saw the first large increase in military spending.

Hitler had been in power for three years and Preston’s languishing industrial base was to form a large part of the looming war effort.

The Munich Agreement of 1938 has been much criticised however it did provide an extra year for war equipment production to gain pace.

ROF Chorley expands

The ROF at Chorley just before demolition Pic: Masonics

Just before the war some munitions production was moved away from cities in the south of England. One site that saw significant investment was at Chorley. £12 million was spent on the Royal Ordnance Factory at Euxton.

Samlesbury expands aircraft production

November 1938 saw 5000 aircraft production jobs created as Vickers Armstrong opened the central aircraft factory at Samlesbury. The English Electric works at Strand Road also began aircraft production.

Construction soon ramped up and the first hangar was ready at Samlesbury by December 1939. As a result aircraft deliveries began early in 1940. In total 900 Hampden and 2145 Halifax bombers were built in Preston.

However still more aircraft were needed and another large factory was built at Warton. Lots of war production money poured into the local economy. Unfortunately rationing meant that there was not much to spend it on.

Leyland factories produce tanks and ammunition

The Cromwell tank produced in Leyland Pic: Morio

During the war production at the motor works in Leyland was enormous. At its peak over 9000 workers assembled 3000 tanks and over 10000 tank engines. Much of the workforce was made up by women. Additionally more than 10000 other vehicles were made.

The tank in question was the Cromwell; this had a Rolls-Royce engine and was first used In Normandy after D-Day in 1944. Interestingly the Meteor engine developed in Leyland was based on the Merlin aircraft engine as used in the Spitfire.

Post-war Preston

All the wartime investment in factories and production capability had revived Preston and district’s flagging industry. Consequently Preston and Leyland were well placed to continue aircraft production and to switch back to commercial vehicle production after the war.

The current generation of DAF trucks made in Leyland Pic: Paccar

Today vehicle and aircraft manufacturing is still going strong. The plant at Leyland makes around 14000 trucks a year. However the Leyland name is not used and the site is now owned by Paccar. More than 1000 people assemble trucks under the DAF brand.

BAE Systems today

The aircraft factory at Warton continues to innovate with the production of the new Tempest fighter.

BAE Systems of the plant:

“A first-of-its-kind industry 4.0 factory is applying game-changing digital technologies to advance manufacturing on Tempest the UK’s next generation combat aircraft system.

“The new facility at BAE Systems’ site in Warton Lancashire is the result of a multi-million pound investment and collaboration with more than 40 blue chip and SME companies along with academic institutions.”

Andreesson’s far from alone in not wanting changes to his backyard however. Many other Silicon Valley executives who also call Atherton Calif. their home are fighting hard alongside him to keep the richest town in America the way it is.

Those executives include Rachel Whetstone chief communications officer at Netflix; Anthony Noto CEO of fintech company SoFi; Andrew Wilson CEO of video game company Electronic Arts; Nikesh Arora CEO of cybertech company Palo Alto Networks; former Apple executive Ron Johnson (better known as the man who invented the modern Apple Store and Genius Bar); and former Google executive Omid Kordtani.

These are just some of the prominent Atherton residents who have publicly voiced their opposition to several proposed multi-family housing projects in the coming years according to reporting by The New York Times which cited their public letters to the town of Atherton. Those projects represent just 58 individual housing units.

The NIMBY vs. YIMBY and single-family vs. multi-family debates

Like all Bay Area municipalities Atherton must put together a proposal every eight years to demonstrate how it plans to build enough housing to keep up with growth as mandated by the Association of Bay Area Governments’ (ABAG) Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) program.

Per RHNA’s most recent analysis Atherton needs to build 348 new housing units over the next eight-year cycle. The town’s planning department released a draft of its plan to meet that quota in June and asked residents to comment. The final plan is due on January 1.

The 58 proposed units causing distress among residents are part of a proposal called “multi-family overlay zones.”

“Because the multi-family overlay zone is a new concept for the town the City Council has been conservative in the identification of parcels that might provide future opportunities for development” reads the proposal. The conservative approach wasn't enough to keep residents happy.

Atherton has never had multi-family housing which is often credited as a means of improving both racial and economic diversity. In nearby Berkeley residents recently voted to eliminate single-family zoning altogether and the city council unanimously denounced the racist history of the zoning practice. Berkeley was also the first U.S. city to adopt single-family zoning all the way back in 1916.

Story continues

These types of zoning often get entangled in a related debate between the so-called NIMBYs and YIMBYs which stand for ""not in my backyard"" and naturally ""yes in my backyard."" The former term has been in use since the 1980s and as housing crises have worsened younger (and poorer) generations have become increasingly YIMBY.

Atherton has held the title of the most expensive zip code in the U.S. for five consecutive years and topped Bloomberg’s Richest Places annual index for four years until 2020. Based on the public letters they submitted to the city’s planning department residents are afraid that the housing proposal would alter their town’s exclusive atmosphere.

“I am writing this letter to communicate our IMMENSE objection to the creation of multifamily overlay zones in Atherton” wrote Andreessen and his wife Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen in an email. “Please IMMEDIATELY REMOVE all multifamily overlay zoning projects from the Housing Element which will be submitted to the state in July. They will MASSIVELY decrease our home values the quality of life of ourselves and our neighbors and IMMENSELY increase the noise pollution and traffic.”

The comment which was originally reported by The Atlantic’s Jerusalem Demsas was also reviewed by Fortune. Andreessen did not respond to either outlet's request for comment. The other executives who opposed the 58 housing units also did not respond to or declined Fortune’s request for comment.

Andreessen’s opposition seems to represent a shift from his expressed views in an essay he publish on his venture capital firm's website at the start of the pandemic titled “It’s Time to Build.""

“We can’t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential—which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future” he wrote.

In the essay Andreessen also noted that his perspective was probably an uncommon one for someone of his ilk: ""I expect this essay to be the target of criticism.""

In July the Atherton planning department removed the multi-family projects from its housing plan.

With 220 million paying subscribers Netflix (NFLX -0.20%) is still the streamer to beat but after reporting two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses its stock price has significantly underperformed the competition.

If you're interested in buying streaming stocks but want to learn about alternatives to Netflix you're in the right place. Three Motley Fool contributors explain why Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD 1.37%) Paramount Global (PARA -0.23%) (PARA.A -2.66%) and Walt Disney (DIS -0.01%) could be in a great position to benefit from the streaming battle unfolding right now.

This newly merged company has a massive content library

Jennifer Saibil (Warner Bros. Discovery): The streaming wars have intensified and this spinoff from AT&T is well positioned to capture market share and grow its business.

So far it's not off to a great start. It was born with a load of debt after the April spinoff that merged Warner Bros. and Discovery and as inflation has hit Americans' pockets it posted a slight year-over-year revenue decrease in the second quarter. The net loss was $3.4 million. It will continue to absorb restructuring costs in the near future as it manages the financials of a large merger.

But there are many reasons to believe it has a bright future most obviously in the form of its huge media library. Warner Bros. Discovery operates a wide range of media networks most of which have been up and running for decades. Some examples are HBO CNN and the Discovery Channel which are all still important assets.

It also owns Warner Bros. Studios which produces franchises including the Harry Potter films and the DC Comics brand. The vast content library already gives the company an edge when competing against Netflix or any other streaming company and brings it straight into streaming's major leagues.

Streaming accounts for only a fairly small portion of the total business. Direct-to-consumer revenue was $2.2 billion in the 2022 second quarter or slightly less than a quarter of the company's total revenue of $9.8 billion. That's a benefit since Warner Bros. Discovery has other resources and revenue generators instead of putting all of its eggs in one basket.

But with 92 million customers for all of its streaming services it offers strong competition for Netflix even if it won't take the mantle of top streaming company in the near future. And while the company's total revenue decreased streaming revenue increased 4% year over year.

Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders might be in for a wild ride as the company charts a path forward but the potential is there. And with shares trading at a cheap price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 1.21 and dirt cheap price-to-sales ratio of only 0.77 this stock has a lot to offer investors.

The complete entertainment package

John Ballard (Paramount Global): Netflix has attributed its recent losses in subscribers to account sharing macroeconomic factors and competition. TV networks were slow to migrate over to digital platforms which gave Netflix a free pass to win subscribers. That has all changed over the last few years.

Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS) has posted impressive growth this year. The company rebranded its CBS All Access streaming service as Paramount+ and it's been growing rapidly. Global streaming subscribers including Pluto TV nearly doubled to 56 million in 2021 and has continued that streak through the first half of 2022.

The combination of news live sports and entertainment in one package appears to be a winning ticket in the streaming market right now. Paramount+ added another 4.9 million subscribers in the second quarter. It is clearly taking share away from Netflix which has reported two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses.

More choice is clearly playing a factor in limiting Netflix's growth right now. It's not over for the company however. Netflix still has the most subscribers if you exclude Disney's Hulu and ESPN+ subscribers. But it's going to need to make some adjustments to keep up with competing media companies and that's easier said than done.

Paramount is executing a successful strategy of leveraging entertainment properties across theatrical releases TV media and streaming to grow its audience. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.6 providing investors more value than Netflix's forward P/E of 23.7. Investors are getting a lot more growth for less than half the price.

Disney is more than challenging Netflix

Parkev Tatevosian (Disney): While Netflix undeniably deserves credit for pioneering the streaming-content industry The Walt Disney Company is quickly catching up. The House of Mouse exploded on the scene in November 2019 when it launched its flagship service Disney+. That's one of its three streaming services with the others being Hulu and ESPN+. Altogether Disney's bundle of three services had 221 million streaming subscribers as of July 2 which slightly eclipsed Netflix's 220 million and change.

Management updated its subscriber target aiming for 230 million at the midpoint by 2024. Unlike Netflix which started from scratch Disney had a robust library of content it could shift to its streaming platforms.

It is home to popular properties like Star Wars Marvel Pixar Mickey Mouse and friends and more. A film or series based on any of the aforementioned group is more likely to attract viewers because of their history.

In its most recent quarter which ended on July 2 Disney's streaming segment generated $5 billion in revenue a 19% increase from the prior year. That's a faster growth rate than Netflix which expanded revenue by 8.6% in its most recent quarter. Still Netflix earned an operating income of $1.6 billion while Disney lost $1 billion in its streaming segment.

Netflix remains the undisputed leader in the streaming industry when measured by the crucial metrics of revenue and subscribers. But as highlighted above Disney's three services surpassed the pioneer in overall subscribers. Investors who want to capitalize on this secular trend could do well by adding Disney's stock to their portfolios.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3RvcC1ndW4tbWF2ZXJpY2stZ2xvYmFsLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtcGFzc2VzLTEtMzctYmlsbGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Gun: Maverick Passes $1.37 Billion at Global Box Office,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3RvcC1ndW4tbWF2ZXJpY2stZ2xvYmFsLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtcGFzc2VzLTEtMzctYmlsbGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

Generally speaking as a company grows institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.

Parker-Hannifin is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of US$40b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about Parker-Hannifin.

Check out our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Parker-Hannifin?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

As you can see institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Parker-Hannifin. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Parker-Hannifin's earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company so they can collectively wield significant power. Parker-Hannifin is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group Inc. is the largest shareholder with 7.7% of shares outstanding. With 6.5% and 4.6% of the shares outstanding respectively BlackRock Inc. and State Street Global Advisors Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.

After doing some more digging we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Parker-Hannifin

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Story continues

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Parker-Hannifin Corporation in their own names. Being so large we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively they own US$222m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership while considerable may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. For instance we've identified 3 warning signs for Parker-Hannifin that you should be aware of.

But I still have bills to pay. Can you help me please?” the thief explains on the flyer while also providing several payment options including Bitcoin and PayPal.The “anymore” reference in the phrase seems to suggest this wouldn’t be the thief’s first stolen car so they claim they will stop doing it if the victim pays.And according to the local media  some people do pay though it’s not clear just how much money they transferred to the extortionist given no amount was specified.PayPal has reportedly confirmed that the account mentioned on the flyer does exist but at the same time the company also warned that any illegal activity would lead to a ban. However no information has been offered as to whether law enforcement contacted PayPal for the account details.Needless to say a Bitcoin payment makes it impossible for the police to figure out who’s behind this scam. This is because nobody can tell who owns a certain wallet so once the victims transfer money to the alleged thief the funds are entirely gone with no way for law enforcement to trace or recover them.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hqdWljZS5way9lbG9uLW11c2staXMtbG9va2luZy10by1zdGFydC1oaXMtb3duLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk is Looking to Start His Own Social Media Platform,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.techjuice.pk', port=443): Read timed out.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

When the sun rises over Lake Charles Sunday morning the iconic 23-foot tall Millennium Statue of Jesus Christ that towers over the final resting places of the city’s namesake and earliest settlers will gleam a little brighter.

That’s because several dozen volunteers spent their Saturday inside Bilbo Cemetery pulling weeds trimming limbs uprooting compromised trees re-welding iron fencing scrubbing the statue and its eight-foot base installing solar lighting and redoing a pathway that runs the length of the historic site.

The private cemetery located on the northeast corner on the lakefront holds the remains of John Jacob Ryan considered the “Father of Lake Charles” as well as war veterans dating back to the early 19th century.

It’s also the final resting place of Tami Chrisope’s great-great grandmother.

“I always feared this place would get bull-dozed because it didn’t look good” said Chrisope senior director of marketing for the United Way of Southwest Louisiana. “These are our city’s founding fathers and doing this just makes it look so pretty. The people out here today are incredible. We really live in an amazing place where everybody does stuff to help others.”

Chrisope who volunteered with three others from her office spent her morning hauling tree limbs out of the cemetery.

“It’s amazing seeing all that’s being done” she said. “I did the Living History Tour in October and the cemetery was so overgrown. It hasn’t been touched really since the hurricane other than mowing. The city can’t repair it because they don’t own it but we can do what we can today to help.”

Husband-and-wife team Kasey and Janice Crowell were among 13 volunteers from Cornerstone Community Church. He spent his morning trimming weeds while she raked up the debris after.

“I appreciate our veterans and I appreciate our city and want to help do what I can for this community” he said. “Right now I’m weeding and trimming up around the graves and when I’m done I’ll do whatever else they need.”

Janice Crowell said it was important to her to do what she could to help her city look better.

“I’m a mother of three who have passed on and gone to Heaven and to be able to honor the people here who founded our city and sacrificed a lot for us even to have a city is my honor” she said. “It’s just a little something we can do for the community.”

Bubba Viator president of the SWLA Veterans Association rounded up the largest group of volunteers and enlisted the help of several local business owners.

“We don’t do anything simple I guess” he said with a laugh. “Our group wanted to help take on this project and we want to help replace and repair and get this back to where it needs to be.”

While one of their group’s 20 volunteers spent his morning using a skid steer to re-dig the walking path the others spread out new gravel and relaid brick pavers. They followed that up with using a donated manlift to pressure wash the statue and install solar lights at its base.

“All the equipment was donated” Viator said. “It’s incredible. It’s pretty neat to see. On Wednesday we knew we had two pieces of equipment coming and today seeing all of this equipment here and all the help it’s amazing.”

When William Ducoty — a Marine veteran and member of the Phillips 66 Veterans Network — arrived at the site he went straight to join two other men who were trimming weeds around the above-ground graves.

“I’m just here as a hand and whatever direction they point me to is what I’ll do” he said with a smile.

“You have all these different walks of life coming together to beautify Lake Charles again after all of the disaster that happened and this whole area is getting developed and what better opportunity to come out here and do something for the community?”

Arborist Jerry DeBarge owner of Jerry’s Tree Service brought his own equipment to the site and instructed volunteers on which trees were salvageable and which needed to be removed.

“We love volunteering because we can do a lot in a hurry” he said of his team who all volunteered their time.

“Last night I came here and looked around and I called Bubba and said ‘Oh yeah we’re coming.’ We’ve got the equipment and the know-how so why not help?”

DeBarge said there were seven species of trees within the cemetery.

“We really want to take out the water oaks because it’s a species that grows wild and gets really big” he said. “They cause 90 percent of damage in most storms. They grow real fast but they only last 60 years and they cause the most damage in cemeteries.”

An American elm one of DeBarge’s favorite species of trees was partially uprooted in the western edge of the cemetery. “I hate to see it go but we’re going to have to take it out today too.”

DeBarge said he’s passionate about advising people on the right kind of trees and the right places to plant them.

“That’s one of the reasons I’m here too” he said. “I want to get rid of the trees that are going to cause long-term problems so this cemetery will stay beautiful as long as possible.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvbWFyeW1hZS1saWVybWFubi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD01Mjg2MDU2MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marymae Liermann Obituary (1955 - 2022),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/marymae-liermann-obituary?id=52860561 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvbWFyeW1hZS1saWVybWFubi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD01Mjg2MDU2MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Howell who died 41 years ago will this October be inducted into the Order of Distinction in the rank of Officer for pioneering the development of the Rastafari philosophy.

Although born into an Anglican family on June 16 1898 Howell broke ties and established the first Rastafarian community with about 4500 members and created the Pinnacle commune in the cool hills of Sligoville St Catherine overlooking the buzzing towns of Spanish Town and Kingston with a breath-taking view that brings peace to one’s soul.

Pinnacle grew into becoming a self-reliant community with farmers who created a sustainable culture. There were also skilled craftsmen and women who shared a faith under the motto ‘One God One Aim One Destiny’.

The destruction of Pinnacle started by the colonial authorities in 1954 and the dispersal of its members caused the Rastafarian doctrine to spread into more communities such as Waterloo and Tredegar Park in St Catherine and communities in west Kingston.

Howell died on February 25 1981.

Frederick Findley the sole Rastafarian still living at Howell’s stomping ground said the honour was long in coming.

“I am happy he is being recognised now. It is a good thing for our community and he did a lot for Rastafarians and fighting for our rights and freedom” the 68-year-old Findley told The Gleaner.

Findley recalled being introduced to Howell in the 1970s after expressing an interest in joining the Rastafarian community in his youthful days.

He would subsequently regularly take the miles-long trek from Kingston to Pinnacle to chant with Howell and other Rastafarians.

“Mi did young and I forward up here. A never so di road [did] stay. Dem days deh was stone and bush. Dem deh was donkey cart days” he recalled before showing The Gleaner the foundation of Howell’s house at the location.

Findley bemoaned the fact that the once-sustainable community Howell built is now left solely to him to carry its flag. The COVID-19 pandemic he said made things worse for the already-declining Pinnacle.

“Since the COVID di Rasta dem hardly come here anymore. Di Rasta dem get weak! Every 16th of June Howell’s birthday we used to meet here and keep a little vibes but since COVID that stop happening. The last time is only a couple brethren and sistren remember and come fi wi try keep the tradition alive” he said.

The once-thriving settlement which had hosted a library and a museum during its heyday is now a shadow of its former glory.

Vandals and thieves have also plagued the area stealing stones and other treasured items from Pinnacle as its landmark structures crumbled over time.

Findley wants the Government and heritage interest groups to breathe new life into Pinnacle and have it buzzing again as a tourist attraction and as a retreat for Rastafarians to meet and worship.

Perhaps the darkest period for Rastafarians in the island was between Thursday April 11 and Friday April 12 1963 when bloody violence flared up in Coral Gardens then a farming community nearly 10 miles to the east of Montego Bay St James.

It resulted in the death of eight persons and injuries to hundreds and severe destruction of a Rastafarian camp by members of the security forces who were accused of human and constitutional rights violations.

In April 2017 Prime Minister Andrew Holness apologised for the State’s role in the Coral Gardens Massacre and promised compensation to victims and families of the deceased.

“[It] was wrong and should never be repeated” the prime minister said about the 1963 Good Friday attack – later dubbed Bad Friday.

“The victims of the Coral Gardens Massacre suffered an unimaginable atrocity at the hands of the State. Though decades late the apology given by the PM and the measures announced to compensate the survivors and their families were a welcome first step” former Jamaicans for Justice Executive Director Rodje Malcolm later said.

Nigel Jones a Rastafarian living metres away from Pinnacle was elated when it was revealed on Independence Day a week ago that Howell would be accorded the national honour.

“Mi nuh know him personally but mi have whole heap a history on him. He’s a man weh take up certain tradition and thing so him deserve it y’know. Him defend certain rights fi black people and African heritage” Jones said.

“A lot of it is meaningful to me even the brutality with police and we see it a manifest today same.”

The Lions Music Festival has been a fixture on the entertainment calendar of Newmarket and area for over 62 years.

So many local musicians and music aficionados have been part of this event over the years including yours truly and I want to explore a bit of the history of the Newmarket Lions Club Music Festival if I can.

The festival was organized in 1960 and first presented April 26 1961. It was on Nov. 16 1960 that an organizing committee met in the board room of the Agricultural Offices on Botsford Street to lay out the details of the festival. Eugene McCaffrey was elected as president and Margaret Atkinson became the secretary-treasurer. A committee of music teachers were called upon to set a test syllabus select adjudicators and establish the general rules that would govern the event. This committee was initially made up of Mae Patterson Leon Nash Mona Armstrong and John Giovanelli.

The executive committee decided that it was imperative to maintain the highest standards insisting on examination marks according to the Royal Conservatory of Music. Medals were to be awarded in the solo and duet classes gold for 80 per cent and above silver 75 to 79 per cent and bronze for 70 to 74 per cent.

That first year the festival ran from April 26 to 29 and all classes were adjudicated at St. John’s Auditorium except for piano accordion which was at Prince Charles School. There were 204 entries in the classes of piano accordion vocal solo school groups and church groups both urban and rural.

The local business community provided 14 scholarships and 27 shields and trophies were awarded.

The adjudicators that first year consisted of Madeline Bone for piano Reginald G. Green for vocal solo school and church groups and Eric Mundinger for accordion.

Local school participants marched from their schools to the festival and then marched back after performing. The rural participants came into town by bus and stayed the afternoon.

The tradition of the Festival of Stars Concert started that first year with standing room only. Of note was a young pianist named Jacqueline Bourdon whom they say mesmerized the audience with her incredible talent.

The festival did not turn a profit that first year but through the guidance of the local Lions scholarships were obtained and shields and trophies awarded. The tradition of community involvement and the power of the volunteerism was recognized.

One scholarship was particularly prized as it was awarded to the youngest winner. The scholarship was named the Colville Scholarship after Isabel and Archie Colville who had supported local musicians over a period of three generations. That first year the winner was Nancy Brinkos who at six years old was the youngest winner that year.

The first festival went so well that plans were made to make it an annual Lions Club project. The music committee would meet in October to set in motion the plans for the next year’s festival. That second year they approached the Trinity United Church about renting their auditorium for the growing school sections.

The school groups would assemble on the lower level and supposedly without any noise ascend to the auditorium in the correct order. More and more of the Lions Club members were getting involved and its success was no longer in doubt.

A brilliant marketing decision was the initiation of the poster contest open to grades 7 and 8 classes with the winning posters used in the advertisements for the festival that year.

Those first years several local musicians stood out. As I mentioned Jackie Bourdon on the piano along with Kevin Tunney on the piano and Bud West on his trombone. A choral reading section was added and groups from Stuart Scott School directed by Evelyn Denne were always a hit. I was in fact in two of Miss Denne’s groups selected more for my height and ability to balance the group appearance than my choral reading abilities.

The festival in those early days was a critical success but alas financially it was still operating at a loss. The festival continued to grow with the number of classes expand along with the number of shields scholarships and trophies awarded.

In the formative years the festival would hold an opening night gala where members of council York County politicians and the Lions would give speeches and hype the event. The mayor would declare the week of the festival as Music Week in Newmarket and the Era would feature it in its coverage.

The list of locals who dedicated their time to the festival over the years is impressive. Their ranks included Charles Boyd Jean Jay Emma Broadbent Betty Beer Harold Jackson and Ernie McCaffrey were but a few who made the festival work in those early years.

I understand that there was some concern that the festival may become too big. What would they do if it outgrew the available manpower? Thankfully they were always able to cope.

By 1964 there were more than 5000 children participating in the program and there were 38 marshals to keep everything running smoothly. The Festival of Stars evening moved to the Trinity United Church to accommodate the crowds who wanted to see the show.

In the next few years several performances would stand out. Kevin Tunney would return to dazzle the crowds Keith Evans Garry Wilson Judy Ann Nicholls Bud West with his trombone and Linda West on the piano along with Nancy Brinkos were always crowd favorites.

Eventually the finances came around and the festival started to show a small surplus. The number of participants continued to grow during the 1960s. The festival was using both the Trinity United Church and the St. John’s venue with 142 choirs performing at Trinity United Church alone.

The position of host became more and more important as the numbers continued to grow. People opened their homes to visitors and lunches and dinners were on offer. Some of those who became regular hosts included the Beer family the Broadbent family the Bowman and Blosdale families the Boyds Hammetts Peevers and Mannings to name but a few.

One of the cool things about the festival was that many participants went on to become educators and brought their own students to participate in the festival. People like Keith Evans and Gail Rettie brought their students to compete as they had years before. They were creating an alumnus that was extensive. Two families became renowned for their participation in the festival the Giovanelli Accordion Orchestra which usually received 90 per cent plus in all its completions and the Joseph family of Gormley who were featured by the National Film Board in the Centennial Book of Canada.

The festival continued to thrive into the 1970s. There were a few interesting changes taking place. A section for rock groups was added with James Wrightman named adjudicator. Participants often returned as adjudicators with Wrightman being an excellent example.

The sections changed over the years along with the number of participants. A rock group and recorder section were added. The numbers in some of the sections decreased while some like piano increased from 68 in 1961 to 300 10 years later.

The program for the festival in the mid 1970s featured 127 ads from local businesses. The next generation from some of the previous participant families began to appear at the festival like the Rose family.

Evelyn Denne retired in 1970 but her legend continued to grow. One of the things that always intrigued me was the fact that the winners of the choral reading class were always coached by her. It begs the question why she was so competitive?”A fact I can well attest to. The only question was which one of her groups was going to win?

The festival continued to grow throughout the 1970s. In 1971 the festival added a banner that hung over Main Street. The trophies were eventually replaced by medals. School bands were added to the list of classes and new local talent continued to shine along with some older talent such as Karen Brinkos Linda West Brian Kohler and Lisa Sullivan.

Over the years the various classes continued to flourish the number of participants growing every year. The new classes proved a welcome addition to the program.

On a sad note one of the stars of the early days of the festival was Colin Rose a talented pianist. He died at the tender age of 12 and a Colin Rose Memorial Scholarship was created along with the Colin Rose Memorial Trophy to be given to the most outstanding 12-year-old at the festival.

One can see how certain families seemed to return year after year each year seemingly producing another talented sibling. Examples are plentiful but the Rose family (Donald David and Colin) the West family (Bud and Linda) the Brinkos family (Nancy Karen and Jim) the Schofield family (Ian Joanne and Maureen) and the Reddens (Judy and Susan) would shine over the years.

The festival continued to grow throughout the 1970s and 1980s. One could argue that the festival had hit its stride with the numbers growing exponentially each year. I would be remiss if I did not at this point mention some of the people who were instrumental in the creation of the growth and very existence of the festival.

Gene McCaffrey and Emma Broadbent were there from the beginning. Charles Boyd was a major contributor to the festival financially getting the other merchants to become involved. What can you say about the Newmarket Lions Club? There is a reason why it is called the Newmarket Lions Music Festival. Their participation and part in the initiation of the festival is responsible for the festival and its success.

When one attempts to thank people it is always at the risk of forgetting someone. If I leave anyone out who should have been mentioned please forgive me. Please add your memories and the names of builders in the comment section so that we can properly thank them.

The festival has gone on strong over the years and really the only thing that has sidetracked it was the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years. It is still the pinnacle of the Newmarket music scene and to participate in it is still a time-honoured tradition whether you win or not.

The Lions Club has supported the festival from the beginning and I think they deserve a huge thank you from everyone who has participated or just had the pleasure of watching. The community has supported the festival right from the beginning providing trophies plaques and scholarships not to mention advertising support. The Lions Music Festival became synonymise with great music and a familiar Newmarket tradition.

Next weekend I resume our historic timeline with the opening of the year 1980.

Dr. Claude Vivian “Mr. Conservation” Hobson bears the distinction of having two things named after him at Bemidji State University.

Born in 1884 in Kansas Hobson attended college in Nebraska and went on to complete his doctoral work eventually receiving his doctorate in Education and Psychology.

He began his tenure at the Bemidji State Teachers College Laboratory School for K-8 students as a science supervisor in 1931.

BSU acquired a 240-acre forest in 1948 for academic and recreational use by the university and community. C.V. Hobson stands next to the original sign. Courtesy of BSU Photo Services

Becoming a geography and conservation professor in 1938 Hobson campaigned for the passage of the School Forest Law which authorizes public education institutions to establish and maintain school forests according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

The law was passed in 1949 though BSU had already acquired a 240-acre forest in 1948 for academic and recreational use by the university and community.

The forest would eventually be dedicated to him and become known as the Hobson Memorial Forest. It’s located along County Road 20 near Concordia Language Villages.

Retiring from his position as a geography and conservation professor in 1962 BSU’s student union was built in 1967.

Following his death in 1966 the union was dedicated to Hobson on May 1 1972.

It now houses the Beaux Arts Ballroom BSU Bookstore Lakeside Food Court and several conference spaces.",,,,,,,,,

New emergency care centre for ‘Golden Hour’ care

In a bid to provide ‘golden hour’ care to road accident victims a new emergency care centre (ECC) is being constructed on the Tambaram-Chengalpet national highway at Singaperumal Koil. The 34-km stretch between Tambaram and Mahabalipuram is an accident-prone zone. Accident trauma victims are transferred to Chengalpet Medical College Hospital or Madurantakam Government Hospital which are at least 30 minutes away through ambulances.

Drawing inspiration from similar ECCs constructed on the East Coast Road (ECR) at Injambakkam and Mahabalipuram that helped save close to 20000 lives in the last five years the Union government under its ‘Rurban Mission’ sanctioned Rs 4 crore to construct a similar facility on NH-45 (GST Road) in Chennai’s suburbs last year. The facility is expected t be launched in November.

Safety audit in swimming pools across Chennai

An eight-year-old girl drowned in the swimming pool of an apartment complex in Ambattur on August 6. Following this incident the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has proposed to conduct a safety audit of swimming pools in the city. Member-Secretary of the CMDA Anshul Mishra said that the CMDA has proposed to conduct random checks to prevent such accidents.

After several incidents of pool drowning back in 2015 the Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies (Regulation and Monitoring of Swimming Pool) Rules were issued which detailed dimensions of pools depth barricades and pathways apart from mandating the deployment of lifeguards. In May 2017 a safety audit was conducted after a child and an adult drowned in two different pools. These rules are however flouted in many places per experts.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

JD Beach (No. 95 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) furthered his claim as one of the greatest TT riders in Progressive American Flat Track history scoring a blowout win before a packed house in Saturday night’s Parts Unlimited Castle Rock TT.

Beach who grew up racing at the Castle Rock Washington venue as a youngster was backed throughout the Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle Main Event by a sellout crowd that flocked to the event co-promoted by Thor Drake and The One Motorcycle Show.

JD Beach (95) once again showed his TT dominance after winning the Castle Rock TT.

He did not disappoint.

The start was always destined to be critical at a track where overtaking opportunities were at a premium but no one could have predicted just how impactful it would prove to be. Dallas Daniels (No. 32 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) who started alongside Beach on the front row after the Yamaha teammates won their respective Semis threw his hand in the air when his machine lost power just seconds into the Main Event.

With nowhere to go TT legend Henry Wiles (No. 17 Willy Built/Lyndy Roofing Co. Kawasaki Ninja 650) smashed into the back of Daniels’ machine kicking off a chain reaction that also collected Robert Pearson (No. 27 Rackley Racing/John Franklin Indian FTR750) Dan Stanley (No. 222 Rackley Racing/Wells Tuned Indian FTR750) and Ben Lowe (No. 25 Rackley Racing/Mission Foods Indian FTR750).

While Daniels would go on to make an impressive charge to a fourth-place finish from his back-row restart grid position the incident effectively removed him from contention for the win after he previously looked to be Beach’s biggest concern.

With Daniels busy slashing his way up through the pack Beach rocketed away off the start and piled it on stacking up more than a second on the field less than two short laps into the race.

Reigning Mission SuperTwins champ Jared Mees (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) beat teammate/rival Briar Bauman (No. 3 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) in the sprint to Turn 1. Whether a result of a calculated decision or a forced hand Mees spent the Main focused behind him rather than in front. The strategy paid off though as he managed to keep Bauman corralled behind him for full race distance to stretch his scant championship advantage out just a little bit further (209-203).

Beach who now boasts six wins in the series’ most recent seven TTs stands just three points behind Daniels for third (188-185). More importantly both Estenson Racing aces are now within single-race striking distance of the championship lead with three consecutive Miles looming on the horizon.

“I was just pushing pushing pushing the whole time” Beach said. “I didn’t look back. I didn’t know how close they were. For me it was just about hitting my marks every single lap. Thanks to all the fans. It was a great night for me and my team but we’ve still got a lot of races to go and we’re starting to close the points gap just a little bit. We’ll keep working.”

Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) edged three-time Castle Rock TT winner Sammy Halbert (No. 69 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) for fifth while another local star Davis Fisher (No. 67 Bob Lanphere’s BMC Racing Indian FTR750) finished another further position back in seventh.

Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Latus Motors Racing Harley-Davidson XG750R) Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) and Ben Lowe (No. 25 Rackley Racing/Mission Foods Indian FTR750) completed the top 10.

Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) extended his Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines championship advantage over Cory Texter (No. 1 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07) thanks to a clutch come-from-behind victory.

A back-and-forth battle between the two played out over the course of the entire event. Throughout practice and qualifying TT superstar Janisch looked to have the measure of the entire field once again. But a huge crash out of the lead in his Semi (and further difficulties getting his machine restarted after the fall) forced Janisch to open the Main from the back row.

That put Texter on pole after he won his Semi. However he had his own issues to deal with as the defending champion was competing despite feeling under the weather at the physically demanding course.

The next reversal of fortune occurred off the line when Texter dropped from first to fourth while Janisch leapt up from ninth to fifth. Janisch quickly pounced on his title rival when Texter made a small bobble and then set off after the battle for the lead.

Holeshot winner Kayl Kolkman (No. 98 B&L Plumbing/Rod Lake Racing Yamaha MT-07) threatened to steal the win in what’s slated to be his only Progressive AFT race of the season but a mistake approaching the jump allowed Johnny Lewis (No. 10 Moto Anatomy X Powered by Royal Enfield 650) to drive by into the lead. Janisch forced his way past Kolkman moments later as well not wanting to provide Lewis any opportunity to make an escape at the front.

The Vance & Hines pilot then threw a number of unconventional lines at the Royal Enfield runner in hopes of finding a way through a cat-and-mouse game that allowed Texter and Kolkman to close back in on the leaders as the clock ticked down to :00.

But with just two laps left to determine the winner the red flags flew as a result of a crash on the part of Michael Hill (No. 47 Pacific Auto Trim/Jim Speer Yamaha MT-07).

Despite starting behind Lewis in a staggered restart formation Janisch powered into first and then successfully defended the position to grab his fifth win of the season.

“Oh man I had my work cut out for me with that mistake in the Semi” Janisch said. “I was pretty convinced that was going to cost me. But I got off to two really good starts and I just had to be aggressive early and make any pass I could.

“The Vance & Hines guys worked their tails off. We had a little problem after the crash but we got the bike running. We’re actually riding that same bike. Hats off to my guys. I like to say (getting an oval win) is way better but this might be my favorite win so far. That was unreal.”

Lewis finished second followed by Texter who briefly dropped to fifth at the restart before fighting back to the podium in one of his best salvage jobs in a season packed with them.

Talented privateer Kolkman took fourth while the versatile Andy DeBrino (No. 162 See Motor Coffee Co. KTM 790 Duke) rounded out the top five.

Janisch now leads Texter by 14 points (239-225) as the ever-evolving title fight approaches its final stages.

Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER

Dalton Gauthier (79) captured his second Singles win of the season.

Dalton Gauthier (No. 79 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) survived an intense thrice red-flagged Main Event to score his second win of the Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER season.

Title leader Kody Kopp (No. 12 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) struggled off the line at the start and again in the subsequent restart and then lost another position after coming together with third-placed Brandon Kitchen (No. 80 Vance & Hines/Husqvarna Motorcycles FC450).

Despite the rocky start(s) Kopp finally settled in and set about executing a charge to the front. First he dove up the inside of teammate Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE). He then took full advantage of a tactical error on the part of Trevor Brunner (No. 21 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) who opened the door for Kopp while looking for a line around the outside of race leader Gauthier.

But then – just as Kopp started to apply a heavy dose of pressure on Gauthier – a second red flag was shown following a Andrew Luker (No. 11 Rackley Racing/Keeran Racing Yamaha YZ450F) crash.

Kopp was frustratingly beaten off the line by Brunner for a third time and had a big job in front of him with time running out if he hoped to win in front of his home state fans. That harsh reality may have contributed to the race’s next dramatic turn; Kopp crashed from third with Spanish champion Ferran Cardús (No. 377 Roof Systems of Dallas/Bullet Strong Racing Honda CRF450R) catapulting over top of the fallen factory KTM bringing out a third red flag.

That forced the championship leader to the back of the field while setting up a critical final start-line duel between Gauthier and Brunner. The Honda ace took the race’s final holeshot setting him up perfectly to defend the position over his Yamaha-mounted adversary to the flag.

Gauthier said “My team never stopped working we were at it all day. I felt really good. I call myself a TT guy even though I sucked at Peoria this year. But I like this stuff where it’s tight and technical. I focused on the starts tried to cover the inside and did good consistent laps. I played my cards right and it worked out.”

Whale fended off a late challenge from rookie Chase Saathoff (No. 106 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) to complete the podium while Chad Cose (No. 49 1st Impressions Race Team/Voodoo Ranger Honda CRF450R) edged Kitchen for fifth.

Kopp suffered his worst result of the year finishing down in tenth. It was far from a total disaster however as he extended his point lead slightly in the process finishing two positions ahead of second-ranked Morgen Mischler (No. 13 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R). He now leads by a healthy 46 points (243-197) with just five rounds remaining. Gauthier is third at 185.

This followed a contested poll that they won with a slim majority of 50.3% of the votes cast.

They took office shortly after the promulgation of Kenya’s progressive constitution in 2010. That gave them a unique responsibility of providing leadership on its implementation and entrenchment.

Article 43 of the new constitution covers economic and social rights. It confers every citizen rights to the “highest attainable standard” of health and access to reasonable standards of housing and sanitation. It also calls for access to adequate food of “acceptable” quality clean and safe water social security and education.

As Kenyatta and Ruto’s second term comes to a close it is important to establish the extent to which they have lived up to these constitutional expectations.

During the second term of their presidency (2017-2022) Uhuru and Ruto’s government has focused economic strategy on core aspects of Kenya’s Vision 2030 labelled the Big 4 Agenda.

The strategy rested on four pillars. These were food security affordable housing universal health care and manufacturing and job creation. Through it the government sought to implement projects and policies aimed at accelerating economic growth and transforming lives.

Despite these grand plans in my view the government’s economic performance has been a mixed bag.

On the positive side the outgoing government boasts of infrastructure projects in sectors such as roads and water. Examples include the completed Nairobi Express Way and over 2000 dams that are at various stages of construction.

These projects have the capacity to improve lives. For example better roads will reduce transport time to deliver commodities to markets while completed dams will lower disease incidence by promoting access to clean drinking water.

But there are negatives too. The country’s performance on job creation was weak with unemployment rates worsening by 2.93 percentage points from 2.81% in 2013 to 5.74% in 2021. Weak job creation is explained by the not-so-robust economy. Between 2013 and 2021 Kenya’s economic growth (GDP) averaged 4.4% while tax revenues stagnated at approximately 14.8% of GDP.

Uhuru and Ruto’s most prominent economic legacy is runaway public debt whose growth has not been commensurate with economic performance. In this article I quickly survey what I believe to be the government’s economic performance highlights since 2013.

Public debt

When Uhuru and Ruto took office in March 2013 Kenya’s public debt stood at about KSh 1.8 trillion (US$17.95 billion) of which about 45% was externally sourced. Nine years later (by March 2022) the stock of public debt had grown by 343% to almost KSh 8 trillion (about US$67 billion). Just over 50% is due to external borrowing.

The excessive reliance on loans has driven the ratio of public debt to GDP beyond 70%. This has raised questions about whether the country has the financial capacity to meet present and future obligations (interest and principal) arising from the debt.

Expectedly the ballooning public debt has put a lot of pressure on the exchequer. For the year 2022/23 the country is spending 53.8% of every shilling collected in servicing debt obligations.

The heavy debt servicing outlays have affected social infrastructure sectors. Take health. Official data show that government healthcare spending has hardly grown since 2017. It went up from 2.8% of national government expenditure during 2017/2018 to a measly 3.7% during 2021/2022.

This has meant that the country hasn’t been able to effectively address constraints facing the sector. These include inadequate medical equipment and shortage of trained human resource. Both have reduced the quality of healthcare.

The corollary of low quality healthcare is the country’s high disease burden. For example the annual cancer death rates increased between 2012 and 2018 by almost 16%. It is projected to grow further.

Manufacturing

In the manufacturing sector the government allocated about KSh 135 billion in the 2022/23 budget. This mostly targeted satellite industries in the textile leather agro-processing and construction sub-sectors.

Some gains have been realised. However inadequate infrastructure in the designated industrial zones has discouraged private sector participation and diminished the potential positive effects.

In particular energy infrastructure appears to be the waterloo of manufacturing in Kenya. Kenya’s installed electricity generation capacity stood at only 10730 GWh in 2019 a change of about 20% from the 2013 level of 8943 according to the International Energy Agency’s data.

This level of generation pales in comparison to recently industrialised economies such as South Korea (581492) and emerging economies like South Africa (252639) and Malaysia (175778).

Given its importance to industrialisation the low power generation is an impediment to takeoff in the manufacturing sector. It could therefore delay Kenya becoming a newly industrialised middle-income economy providing high quality life to its citizens.

Food security

Years of failed economic policies reliance on rain-fed agriculture and nomadic livestock husbandry low levels of mechanisation of food production and insufficient emergency food reserves have combined to expose swathes of the country to food shortages.

By including agriculture in the Big 4 Agenda Uhuru’s government sought to reduce the severity of these effects. There have been achievements such as the expansion of insurance coverage of farmers commissioning of national food reserves commissioning of grain driers and opening of agro-processing incubation and research centres.

Yet these achievements have not spawned visible impact: the current drought in the Horn of Africa region has triggered fears of impending food shortages in which an estimated 3.5 million to 4 million Kenyans could face severe hunger malnutrition and starvation.

Overall food production has not performed very well during the 2013–2022 period. For example agricultural value added grew from 18.6% of GDP to 22.4% a meagre expansion over the nine-year period. This was despite efforts to support value addition in agriculture such as processing fruits into juices.

The fight against corruption

Like most countries in post-independence Africa weak institutions and poor governance have been Kenya’s bane. Most Kenyans therefore welcomed Uhuru’s declaration of corruption as a national security threat and his promise to tackle it.

Kenya has a well-established institutional framework for dealing with dishonesty in the management of public resources. Chapter 6 of the constitution imposes high standards of integrity on holders of state offices and establishes an independent ethics and anti-corruption commission to ‘ensure compliance and enforcement’.

But Kenya still ranks among the worst in corruption perception. This suggests that the public sees the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission as a lame duck institution.

For example there have even been accusations that the constitutional body has lent itself to partisan political interests since Uhuru’s anti-corruption campaign appeared to target political rivals.

Credence was lent to these accusations recently by the leaked information published in the Pandora Papers. The leaked information appeared to implicate the president’s family in the stashing of fortunes in offshore tax havens. Although the report does not necessarily imply financial impropriety the anti-corruption body has not to my knowledge investigated these allegations.

Nevertheless the commission recently demonstrated its mettle when a case that it brought before the court led to a conviction of individuals implicated in a maize procurement fraud worth nearly US$3 million. Yet many similar cases have been dragging in court for a long time while some have been dropped.

Conclusion

As the country ushers in a new government Kenyans hope that the mistakes of the last 10 years can be avoided while the gains realised are built on. For example will the investment in infrastructure be exploited to maximise welfare gains?",,,

The PA said in a statement on Friday it was imposing administrative sanctions on Nedbank and it directed the bank to take remedial action following an inspection in 2019 in terms of the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) Act.

A Nedbank spokesperson said the inspection had come less than two months after amendments to the FIC Act were required to be implemented by April 2 2019. “While Nedbank has paid the financial penalty and acknowledged the administrative shortcomings present at the time in 2019 it would like to highlight that the lengthy delays in promulgating the amended FIC Act had particular adverse implications for Nedbank -- given the extended delays in requirements definitions which impacted finalisation of system requirements in conjunction with Nedbank’s information technology transformation programme that was already well underway” a Nebank spokesperson said. “There was no evidence of Nedbank being involved in or facilitating transactions involving money laundering or the financing of terrorism” the PA said in a statement.

The sanctions imposed included cautions reprimands and a R35m financial penalty of which R15m was conditionally suspended. The PA said Nedbank had failed to comply with Risk Management and Compliance Programme obligations. It failed to apply a risk-based approach across its business clusters. It failed to apply enhanced due diligence controls and it failed to risk-rate its clients. The bank also did not provide evidence that it had developed and documented end-to-end procedures and methods relating to its systems and processes used to onboard clients. Also it did not provide evidence that its controls and/or oversight measures were able to extract the correct data that would allow it to accurately risk-rate its clients.

Nedbank had also failed to comply with its record-keeping obligations. It failed to comply with its cash threshold reporting obligations as well and it failed to report a significant number of cash transactions that exceeded the R24 999.99 threshold. Nedbank was also unable to timeously determine when a transaction was reportable in terms of the FIC Act.

The development will replace a self-storage facility with nearly a quarter million square feet of leasable area. Menlo Equities and Beacon Capital Partners are joint venture partners for the project.

The six-story building will yield around 411670 square feet with 205270 square feet of occupiable area and 206400 square feet for the 458-car garage. The garage will occupy two below-grade levels under the 2.4-acre plot of land. The rest of the structure will rise on 1.2 acres with about 40% of the leasable area for office use and 60% for life science laboratories.

Employees will have access to several outdoor terraces for dining and socializing. An on-site cafe will serve food throughout the day with the cafe connected to an outdoor terrace. Exercise facilities will be included on-site. Additional parking will be included for 82 bicycles.

RMW Architecture is listed as responsible for the design. The exterior will be wrapped with a curtainwall glass skin providing the interior with natural lighting. A series of setbacks will conform the building with the swooping southeast property border with a rooftop terrace set back reducing the project’s perceived scale from the sidewalk.

405 Industrial Road was acquired by Menlo Equities and Beacon Capital Partners in March of 2021. The property is currently a self-storage facility. Once complete the building will be able to host up to 685 employees at a time. The estimated timeline for construction and completion has not yet been established.

All participants were informed about the goal of this study and informed consent was obtained from electronic signatures of all participants. Data were collected anonymously. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Study design and sample size

A cross-sectional survey was designed and conducted among Chinese antibiotic users from July 1 2018 to September 30 2018 based on the China’s largest online survey platform (Questionnaire Star https://www.wjx.cn). Questionnaire Star is a professional service platform for electronic questionnaire design and data collection which has been widely used by researchers. This study focused on following three aspects of inappropriate use behaviors: SMA SSA and NAAT. The NAAT consisted of four types of non-adherence behaviors including missing antibiotics increasing antibiotic dosage decreasing antibiotic dosage and discontinuing antibiotics. To ensure the stability and reliability of the survey results the sample size should be as large as possible. In our study the maximum sample size was calculated with the minimum prevalence of these target behaviors. We used the formula:\(n={z}^{2}p(1-p)/{d}^{2}\) where n is the sample size p is the prevalence of the research target z is the normal deviation (1.96) and d is the margin of error (d = 0.1p). When determining parameter p we took the prevalence of target behaviors among publics in the past 6 months as the criterion according to previous studies. Among them the prevalence of non-adherence behavior with proactively increasing antibiotic dosage was the lowest with 8.3%–22.0% [17 19]. Therefore we took the median value and set the confidence interval (CI) at 95% to calculate the sample size of 2152. Considering the possibility of invalid surveys (about 15%) at least 2532 participants should be surveyed in each region.

According to the China Health Statistical Yearbook (2018) [20] the population who participated in the online questionnaire were divided into three regions: eastern central and western China. To ensure the representativeness of the survey samples in each region the administrator would close the network link and end the questionnaire survey when the number of survey samples in each region reached 2532 participants.

Measurements

To reflect the prevalence of inappropriate use behaviors of antibiotics among Chinese antibiotic users we selected three main outcomes: the percentage of SMA the percentage of SSA and the percentage of NAAT. In this study SMA was defined as answering “yes” to the question: “During the past 6 months did you self-administer antibiotics without a doctor’s prescription?” SSA was defined as answering “yes” to the question: “During the past 6 months did you self-storage antibiotics at home for future use?” NAAT was measured according to four types of non-adherence behaviors that were developed from previous studies [21]: (1) Did you ever miss medication during the course of antibiotic treatment? (2) Did you ever increase the dosage by yourself during the course of antibiotic treatment? (3) Did you ever reduce the dosage by yourself during the course of antibiotic treatment? (4) Once symptoms disappear do you immediately discontinue the course of antibiotics? Each item measures a type of specific non-adherence behavior and dichotomous responses (Yes/No) are captured. The item is scored with 0 point if the response is “Yes” and scored with 1 point if the answer is “No”. The total scores range from 0 to 4 with the higher the score the higher the antibiotic user’s adherence. The total scores ≤ 2 are considered as “non-adherence” and the total scores > 2 are considered as “adherence.”

To identify the relevant factors of inappropriate use behaviors of SMA SSA and NAAT we also collected the demographic and sociological characteristics including gender age place of residence (urban/rural) educational level (junior high school or below/ high school/junior college or above) self-perceived economic status (good/ average/poor) self-perceived health status (good/ average/poor) and antibiotic knowledge. Antibiotic knowledge is assessed by asking 10 questions in three sections: the knowledge regarding antibiotic role antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance. These 10 questions are estimated using a scoring scheme with score of 1 for a correct response and 0 for an incorrect response. The total scores of knowledge range between 0 and 10. We divided the total scores of antibiotic knowledge into three levels as following: (1) high level: 8–10 scores; (2) medium level: 3–7 scores; (3) low level: 0–2 scores. In the questionnaire Cronbach’s α coefficients of non-adherence behavior scale and antibiotic knowledge scale were 0.71 and 0.84 (> 0.70) respectively. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the standardized factor loading of each item of non-adherence behavior scale ranged from 0.52 to 0.57 (> 0.40) and these values of the antibiotic knowledge scale were all above 0.70. The results of these tests indicated that the questionnaire had good reliability and validity.

Data collection

We designed a questionnaire and generated a valid QR code of this questionnaire on the online survey platform. Then we recruited 50 graduate and undergraduate students from the School of Public Health at Huazhong University of Science and Technology as investigators in July 2018. Four of them refused the request to distribute questionnaires with a participation rate of 92%. After the unified training the investigators would get the QR code of questionnaire. During the summer vacation all sent out electronic questionnaires through their personal social software such as “WeChat”. The respondents scanned the QR code on their mobile phones to fill in the questionnaire. The data administrator checked the questionnaire and sorted out the data through the background every week. When each region (eastern central and western China) reached the minimum required survey sample of 2532 the administrator closed the network link and finished the survey.

Before the survey we conducted a questionnaire pilot test to ensure the smooth implementation of all steps including the respondents’ login on the platform questionnaire filling and submission. we set the following inclusion criteria that the respondents filling in the questionnaire must meet: (1) adults aged 18 years or above; (2) living in the area for more than 6 months; (3) normal cognitive and understanding abilities; (4) aware of the term “antibiotic” and having used antibiotics. To ensure that only one questionnaire per respondent can be filled out we limited one IP address per submission on the online survey platform and required to log in with a personal mobile phone number (in China the mobile phone number is real-name system) before filling in the questionnaire. During the survey to improve the enthusiasm of respondents we paid 3 Yuan in cash to each person who completed the questionnaire as an economic incentive. To ensure that respondents must read and answer the questionnaire carefully we set three quality inspection questions at different locations namely: “Where is the capital of China?” “What is 7 minus 2?” and “What is 1 plus 3?” If the answer to any of these three questions was incorrect the questionnaire would be marked as invalid. After the respondents completed the questionnaires all the questionnaires were automatically input into a data file and two researchers independently collated and verified the data to ensure the reliability of the survey data.

During the process of the survey 21874 respondents visited the questionnaire link and 17062 respondents actually completed the questionnaire. Since this was an online survey the true response rate could not be determined here. Among all the questionnaires 1280 questionnaires were excluded because of unqualified quality inspection and 256 questionnaires were also excluded because of respondents under the age of 18. Finally 15526 valid questionnaires were obtained.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive analysis of the demographic and sociological characteristics antibiotic knowledge and various inappropriate use behaviors of the participants was conducted. The classified variables were expressed as frequency and percentage and the continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD). To examine the possible impact of the controversial Q5 and Q9 from the antibiotic knowledge scale (Table 2) on the study results [22 23] a sensitivity analysis was performed by deleting these two items. When these two items were removed the total scores for antibiotic knowledge became between 0 and 8. The total scores of antibiotic knowledge were re-divided into three levels as following: (1) high level: 7–8 scores; (2) medium level: 3–6 scores; (3) low level: 0–2 scores. Furthermore binary logistic regression model was used to explore the factors associated with the inappropriate use behaviors of SMA SSA and NAAT among antibiotic users. Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% CI for each variable were given. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc. Cary NC). Statistical tests were double-tailed; a P value < 0.05 was considered to be significant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZW5zNS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lL3JlbGF0aXZlcy1hc2hlcy1zcGlsbGVkLW1pbGl0YXJ5LW1lZGFscy1kYW1hZ2VkLXN0b3JhZ2UtZmFjaWxpdHktYnVyZ2xhcnkvMjczLTQxYzE3N2FmLTc2ZmUtNDFmNi04NTE3LTExNDBlOGQwOTAyYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It hurts' | Relatives' ashes spilled military medals damaged in storage facility burglary victims say,"San Antonio Police say two men were arrested at the scene after a reported burglary at the Otter Self Storage off of Loop 410 near Marbach Road.

SAN ANTONIO — Four men are in custody after a burglary at a west-side storage facility where police say at least 15 units were broken into Saturday morning.

SAPD officials say they were dispatched to Otter Self Storage along the 2400 block of SW Loop 410 at around 7:20 a.m. where the suspects were detained ""after a brief foot chase."" While the quartet has been charged with burglary it's unclear if they're the ones who broke into the storage units nor have police said how they may have done so as their investigation continues.

Regardless the appearance of security at the complex including security cameras and a gate doesn’t match the intangible reality for Robert Rodriguez. The burglary is causing anguish for someone who already has wounds.

“It does hurt. It hurts more than me getting this thing” Rodriguez said as he pointed to the Purple Heart license plate on the back of his car.

“It hurts more than that. Because I can take the physical pain but the emotional pain is tough” Rodriguez said.

Rodriguez says his belongings were kept here for a short time after a 20-year career in the military.

“I had a lot of artifacts presidential citation for retiring from the Marines. Command medals ribbons. Everything was thrown to the ground scratched up and broken and uh you know what can I do man it was memories” Rodriguez said.

Many other items were missing or damaged when people renting units heard about what happened.

Lisa Wright says she was at the facility but couldn’t access her belongings which included family keepsakes.

While SAPD said at least 15 units were broken into Wright said the number is higher—closer to 30.

“I was crying. Not because of my belongings but to see a lady on the ground picking up her parent’s ashes from her urns being smashed” Wright said. “It’s all gone because some individuals are just hard on their times I guess.""

On Sunday afternoon the gates were locked and people were unable to retrieve their belongings. A sign posted on a keypad said renters must contact the office and set an appointment to get their belongings.

“All I can tell people who lost some important things…Don’t look at it as a downer look at it as something you can get through and it’s only going to make you stronger” Rodriguez said.

The rate of adoption of Wi-Fi 6E connectivity across the tech industry is increasing: Last week Samsung announced two new Galaxy Z foldable phones powered by Qualcomm’s FastConnect 6900 Wi-Fi 6/6E platform. Meanwhile ARRIS (CommScope) has released the ‘SURFboard Thruster™ W6B gaming acceleration kit’ based on Qualcomm’s Networking Pro 610 platform as well as an AP to upgrade your existing router to Wi-Fi 6E.

Last week we reported that the number of Wi-Fi 6E-capable devices in the world has reached a whopping 792 – read more here – but that number already seems outdated as Wi-Fi vendors are beginning to release Wi-Fi 6E-capable devices on a weekly basis. On August 10 Qualcomm announced that the new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Galaxy Z Flip 4 are powered by the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor which also incorporates the Wi-Fi 6 and 6E capable FastConnect 6900 connectivity platform.

The two new foldable screen phones are definitely high-end: The Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Galaxy Z Flip 4 will retail in the US at US$1599 and US$999 respectively. The products were unveiled at Samsung’s ‘Galaxy Unpacked’ event of Wednesday last week. More details can be found here.

Meanwhile ARRIS – a division of CommScope – released what they call the ‘SURFBoard Thruster W6B gaming acceleration kit’ which is basically a couple of sleek looking APs delivering a point-to-point 6 GHz Wi-Fi connection between your existing router and your gaming console or PC. As far as we know this is the first Wi-Fi 6E network product dedicated to delivering a single dedicated Wi-Fi 6E connection.

Specifically for gaming this seems to make a lot of sense. A lot of homes are of course not wired with Ethernet cabling so getting a broadband signal from your CPE to wherever your gaming console or PC happens to be is not easy – also keeping in mind that regular smart home Wi-Fi often doesn’t deliver the wireless connectivity quality and speed that gamers want.

ARRIS says the new system can reach speeds of up to 4.8 Gbps. The product is being marketed as “wired performance without the wires” and a way to avoid Wi-Fi interference. It also deliver the low latency connectivity that gamers crave ARRIS says. According to this source the retail price of the two-unit package is US$310.

ARRIS has also released the SURFBoard W6U a Wi-Fi 6E AP that plugs into existing equipment and upgrades your home network to Wi-Fi 6E without replacing existing hardware ARRIS says. For more about the SURFBoard W6U read here. Both new ARRIS Wi-Fi 6E home networking systems are powered by the Qualcomm Networking Pro 610 platform.

It is the best Snapdragon 8Cx Gen 3 we’ve seen to date and its design revolves around a few pillars: productivity connectivity experience and security.

It has good performance for an office productivity computer and even though it can play some games that’s not what it was built for. For office work it keeps you productive without worrying about battery life or WiFi availability thanks to its built-in 5G.

Pay attention if your computing life revolves around web apps or the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. This laptop could positively change your mobile PC experience forever.

Configuration

All versions of the ThinkPad X13s come with a 13.3” FHD display and a Snapdragon 8Cx Gen 3 computing platform. Our unit has the following configuration: 16GB non-touch display and 512GB of storage. That said there are various options you can choose from.

Three FHD display variants are available; two are non-touch with 300 NITs or 400 NITs brightness. The 400 NITs version has better overall image quality according to the specs. There’s one 300 NITs touch-enabled variant which we would choose for usability reasons.

""IT’S AWESOME TO BE ABLE TO PUSH RAM TO 32GB""

The RAM is soldered and comes with 8 16 or 32GB of LPDDR4X. 16GB should work for most people but it’s awesome to be able to push RAM to 32GB if you know why you need it. The storage option includes at least 512GB and 1TB of NVMe SSD.

These are the significant differences between models. Other ones might include the availability of 5G mmWave (or not) or power supply SKU (2x45W models and 4x65W models depending on the laptop configuration) for example.

Pricing starts at $1300+ at Lenovo.com

Industrial Design

The Lenovo ThinkPad X13s design comes with the iconic ThinkPad black matte color and from a distance it could pass for something in-between the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 and the ThinkPad X1 Nano Gen1.

At 13.4 mm (.53”) thin weighing only 2.35 lbs (1.06kg) it is an ultralight ultracompact computer with the following dimensions: 298.7 x 206.4 x 13.4 mm (11.76 x 8.13 x 0.53 inches)

A closer inspection shows a design language tweak with curved surfaces and rounded edges. The paint has a rubberized texture that makes it seem like a “suede” surface softer to the touch than the typical ThinkPad paint.

Under the paint the chassis is built with 90% recycled magnesium alloy. Lenovo is upped its sustainability game and there’s a lot of recycled plastic too. There’s certainly enough plastic around but not enough companies willing to make this effort.

At the top of the back display cover there’s a prominent “camera bar” which makes it possible to house a larger higher-quality camera module. We’ll get back to that a bit later.

The bottom cover can be removed for servicing (IT loves this) and the SSD can theoretically be swapped. However it is located under the cooling heatsink perhaps one step further than the average user might want to take.

The Qualcomm X55 5G modem is also accessible if it needs repair. It is located where the SIM slot is but supports eSim as well. For a computer this modem (and the Qualcomm WIFI/BT hardware) represents a world-class connectivity option that should work worldwide.

One can’t help but notice there are no cooling vents at all and for a good reason: this is a passively cooled computer that will never annoy you with fan noise. It is also extremely tough and passed a bunch of MIL-STD-810H tests (military transport certification) like other ThinkPads.

Keyboard & Trackpad

The ThinkPad X13s features a full-size spill-resistant keyboard that is visually similar to other ThinkPad computers. Because of its size the travel key seems to be around 0.9-1mm. The keys aren’t clicky like the ThinkPad X1 Nano Gen 1. Instead they are very soft and extremely quiet.

The Mylar trackpad is very smooth and feels like glass. Its 56 x 115mm size makes it a big touch surface a great use of the available space. It could have been larger if it wasn’t for the two physical Left/Middle/Right buttons which we think are much more precise than trackpad “taps.”

Of course the legendary TrackPoint is present and works like any other ThinkPad. There are two backlight levels in dim lighting conditions to keep the keyboard readable.

Ports

There are two USB-C 3.2 Gen2 10 Gbps ports to the chassis’ left. Both can be used to charge the laptop as well. There’s no Thunderbolt (TB) support because TB is an Intel technology that reaches 40 Gbps of data transfer.

That said USB-C 3.2 Gen2 is decent and allows connecting two 4K displays to this tiny laptop. If using a dock you should be able to have a one-cable setup to turn the ThinkPad X13s into a desktop computer.

The classic 3.5mm audio and Kensington anti-theft connectors are on the right side.

Sound Quality

This laptop has two 2W top-firing speakers which is definitely the optimum placement. It’s always impressive to see such compact computers having this feature while larger ones can’t quite pull it off.

The audio quality is great for a computer this size and the voices are very clear while watching movies. The bass could be improved but given the internal volume available we can’t fault Lenovo for not having a sub-woofer until someone else does it.

The sound quality would work very well for conference calls and watching movies at your desk or hotel room. By the way the small size makes this computer ideal for airline tray tables.

Display

The 1080p/FHD resolution is a fine and appropriate choice and we wonder what a 3:2 ratio would look like (see X1 Titanium Yoga) especially for an office productivity laptop. As we mentioned there are a few options with touch or not.

They all have excellent color reproduction with around 100% of the sRGB color gamut and between 300-400 NITs of brightness which is typical for laptops at this price level. The display quality is adequate for light Creative work (web dev photoshop art review…).

The top camera module is one of the significant improvements in the ThinkPad lineup and so far this 5MP camera (f/2.0 aperture) is the best webcam we’ve seen on any laptop.

Lenovo is going in the right direction and we don’t mind the camera bump if the quality matches the extra size. There’s no reason laptops can’t catch up with phones’ cameras and working with Qualcomm is the fast track to get there.

""THE BEST WEBCAM WE’VE SEEN ON ANY LAPTOP""

There’s no physical shutter but an electronic ON/OFF function (alt+F9) that works just as well. The only downside is there’s no physical blocker you can visually check. Perhaps a “red LED” (or something) could be a substitute in the future.

Our camera was compatible with Windows Hello and that’s our primary way to log in securely. If you prefer the fingerprint reader it’s located in the Power button.

Performance

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8Cx Gen3 is an excellent ARM-based computing platform that is highly power-efficient. The ThinkPad X13s can beat pretty much any Intel-equivalent laptop regarding battery life.

From a pure computing power perspective through the lens of benchmarks it is roughly equivalent to an AMD Ryzen 5 4500U or an 11th Gen Intel Core i5. If you need extra speed and are willing to sacrifice battery life in the same form factor I’d recommend looking at the ThinkPad X1 Nano with the Intel i7-1160G7.

With Windows 11 the Snapdragon 8Cx platform is more relevant than ever because it can execute X86 32 and 64-bit applications. The apps’ compatibility is better than ever and we have not bumped into any issues with our usual apps. They all ran including Photoshop.

“Some” apps might still fail. For example 3dMark Night Raid is the only one in the franchise that will work. DaVinci Resolve is not going to find a compatible GPU. There might be more like this so we’d recommend doing some homework on these high-performance apps.

It would help if Microsoft had a compatibility database we could search. We’ll say it again: this is an office productivity laptop.

On the other hand games like the recent GTA will run although at a relatively slow 20 FPs. Your best bet for gaming is to use one of the game-streaming services such as GeForce Now (and others) as any X86 emulation will have little impact on the streaming client’s performance.

Finally any high-powered app will eventually bump into thermal throttling as the passive cooling does an excellent job for web browsing and office work but can’t move the heat fast enough for intense gaming. The system will eventually slow itself down to match the heat dissipation capabilities.

The ThinkPad X13s offers good performance for office work (set to “Balanced” performance) and can be set to extreme battery performance while watching movies or reading documents. Unlike previous ARM-based PCs this one feels like a “normal” Core i5 laptop.

""EXCEPTIONAL BATTERY LIFE""

The ThinkPad X13s offers exceptional battery life and we’ve tested it during recent travel that included working on the go using 5G for always-on connectivity etc. At no time were we stressed with the battery level; chances are you’ll be exhausted before your battery is.

Its 49.5Wh battery capacity is enough to sustain the computer for what we estimate to be 14-16 hours of office work. If you work “only” 8hrs a day it fits the “multi-day” battery life that both Qualcomm and Lenovo mention. When closed the computer retains its charge better than conventional laptops.

According to Lenovo the laptop can play local movies (an MP4 on your disk) for 22-28 hours at 150 Nits brightness depending on your power settings (best performance best battery life) if nothing else is running in the background without active WIFI/5G that sounds believable.

It takes 1h20mn to reach 100% if you need to charge it. It would be fantastic if Lenovo could make this even faster in the future. We’ve recently tested phones that can be fully charged in 20mn like the OnePlus 10T and it’s very addictive.

Conclusion

The Lenovo ThinkPad X13s is the best Snapdragon-based laptop we’ve seen thus far that hits where it matters these days: ultra-long battery life extreme connectivity and superior webcam quality which can make a massive difference for road warriors or work-from-home users.

It’s the first ARM-based PC we’ve tested that feels like an Intel Core i5 equivalent in the real world and it seems like an inflection point for Qualcomm’s fray into the laptop PC market. Qualcomm has many ways to quickly ramp up the computing power once this segment goes vertical. Apple has demonstrated it.

For IT organizations this laptop also comes with Lenovo’s Premier Support ThinkShield and secure manageability making it easier to manage thus actually saving time and money. It’s something you might not consider as a consumer but I’ve seen many corporations that would only offer ThinkPads to their employees for this reason. SMBs might not have an IT department so this support level might prove helpful.

Finally it is a sturdy laptop that can survive shocks and spills better than most. There’s nothing worse than having a dead laptop in the middle of a business trip.

The camera is the most important feature of a phone after its battery life on the consumer’s list of must-haves. In this technological era cameras have advanced so greatly that most of the phones on the market belonging to big companies come with a variety of features that are borrowed from a professional camera such as phase-detect autofocus and optical image stabilization. With android phones this has been made possible with the Snapdragon processors.Qualcomm’s Snapdragon mobile platform has a noteworthy amount of silicon resources that are made and put there specifically to process images and videos. Without this processor maybe your phone’s camera quality might be very different or your videos and photos would not even be the same.According to Qualcomm’s insights out of the total respondents that were surveyed 44% said that camera quality was the most critical for them so it got 4th place. But when the users with phones that cost $1000+ were surveyed they said that camera quality took 2nd place for them after Battery life.Most consumers believe that pixel size and sensor quality are the defining qualities of the camera and its outcome. But that isn’t exactly the case as they are more irrelevant than people believe. The thing is that most phones cannot quarter large sensors because of physical measurements and the pixel size can only get so high before the image quality degenerates.Smaller pixels gather more light than large pixels which can have an undesirable impact on the image quality especially in lighting conditions that are hard to work with.H/T: Forbes Read next: Back to School Season Marred By Massive Uptick in Education Sector Cyberattacks,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8va2FsaW5nYXR2LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21vdG8tZzYyLTVnLWJ1ZGdldC1zbWFydHBob25lLWxhdW5jaGVkLWluLWluZGlhLWNoZWNrLXByaWNlLXNwZWNzLWFuZC1mZWF0dXJlcy_SAXRodHRwczovL2thbGluZ2F0di5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9tb3RvLWc2Mi01Zy1idWRnZXQtc21hcnRwaG9uZS1sYXVuY2hlZC1pbi1pbmRpYS1jaGVjay1wcmljZS1zcGVjcy1hbmQtZmVhdHVyZXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moto G62 5G budget smartphone launched in India: Check price specs and features,"Motorola has launched a new 5G budget smartphone Motorola G62 in the Indian market.

RL,Ralph Lauren Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzE0L3Nob3VsZC15b3UtcmVhbGx5LWJ1eS1yYWxwaC1sYXVyZW4tYWZ0ZXItaW52ZW50b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should You Really Buy Ralph Lauren After Inventory Jumped 47%?,"The retailer is making a bold bet on future demand trends.

Investors were happy to learn that Ralph Lauren (RL -0.53%) is still targeting solid sales and earnings growth this year. Wall Street had been worried about slowing demand supply chain challenges and declining profitability compared to impressive results in these areas last year.

Ralph Lauren eased a few of these worries with its latest earnings update showing steady demand and a stable profit margin outlook. The stock is performing well compared to the wider market in 2022 likely because investors see the potential for a rally if consumer spending stays strong through the holiday season.

That enthusiasm should be tempered by major risks with the apparel and accessories specialist the biggest of which is that Ralph Lauren is entering the key holiday shopping season with too much inventory.

Let's take a closer look.

Stocking up

As of early July Ralph Lauren's inventory level stood at $1.2 billion up 47% compared to the prior year. That surge compares to just a 13% increase in first-quarter sales.

Executives painted the inventory boost as a precaution aimed at securing enough merchandise for the upcoming season demand peak around the Christmas holiday. ""We deliberately shift[ed] inventory receipts earlier to mitigate global supply chain disruptions"" management explained in an early August press release.

That shift sets Ralph Lauren apart from larger retailers like Target which have slowed and delayed their purchasing plans to lower the risk of holding lots of inventory. Target executives said in July that the current demand environment required these changes ""to remain nimble"" as demand trends shift quickly.

Ralph Lauren admits that its approach is risky. ""The global operating environment remains as volatile as ever"" CEO Patrice Louvet said in a press release. But executives are still making a bold bet that they have a good grasp on consumer tastes.

Will it work?

Investors have some encouraging signs suggesting Ralph Lauren won't have to follow companies like Walmart and Target in slashing prices and taking inventory write-down charges. Demand was solid through early July after all and the company posted surprisingly strong profitability.

Its focus on premium lifestyle products insulates it from some of the demand shifts that have hurt other retailers and it's also notable that Ralph Lauren doesn't sell bulky home furnishings products. These niches have been hit hardest by consumer demand shifts in recent months.

Still investors should be aware of the big risk associated with packing warehouses with merchandise today. Economic growth trends are slowing in key markets like Europe and shoppers are shifting their spending patterns more quickly than normal. It is always a core retailing challenge to balance supply and demand but that goal is even harder right now.

Ralph Lauren's bet could pay off handsomely for investors if consumers snap up the products it has secured for the fall and winter shopping seasons. On the other hand the wrong prediction would lead to lower profitability and weaker earnings through the rest of fiscal 2023.

Sure the retailer's latest results show no signs of this profit shortfall on the way. But investors won't know for several months whether Ralph Lauren was right about its customers' enduring demand for apparel and lifestyle products. That means the stock's risk profile is rising and investors should be careful about loading up on shares.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3NodW50aW5nLmNvbS5hdS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZGVzaWduL3JhbHBoLWxhdXJlbi1ob21lLXBhbGF6em8tY29sbGVjdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ralph Lauren Home's Palazzo Collection Is Packed With Inspired Italian Flair,"Ralph Lauren is a man who has spent his life celebrating a distinctly American aesthetic from his contributions to the Preppy sartorial expressions of college campus life to the integration of Native American designs and traditions into his collections. But this year for the first time the Ralph Lauren Home collection brings a certain Italian flavour to its intent launching at Milan Design Week and being showcased in the palazzo of Ralph Lauren in the famous European city.

The 2022 collection was showcased in an immaculate 1941 property that was originally designed by architect Mino Fiocchi and served as the perfect place to present Ralph Lauren’s more continental side. Several rooms of the mid-century building were brimming with pieces from the new collection immersing VIPs in something of a time capsule from a distant but resplendent past of intricately woven fabrics and traditionally made furniture.

Furniture highlights included the Elsworth bar cabinet that boasts walnut ebony maple and mahogany inlaid marquetry executed in a geometric trompe l’oeil pattern. Likewise the Bradburn sofa steps back in time to the golden age of the classic chesterfield while still feeling modern.

“I have long been inspired by the romance and timeless beauty of Milan—its winding cobblestone streets the patina of its ancient façades and its rich heritage of artisanal craftsmanship” said Ralph Lauren. “When we discovered our palazzo in the late ’90s I knew I had found our home in Milan.”

The Ralph Lauren Home Palazzo collection is named after the headquarters of the iconic American fashion brand and is a signal of the designer’s interest in classic European design. Last November the brand opened The Bar at Ralph Lauren on Via della Spiga and if reports are true the label is already working on its next Italian-centric collection for the tasteful home.

Special to Bucs Report

As the Buccaneers prepare to kick off the 2022 season with Saturday’s preseason home opener against the Miami Dolphins the team has unveiled a variety of new offerings that will enhance the gameday experience for Buccaneers fans at Raymond James Stadium.

Unprecedented Demand

In response to an unprecedented demand for 2022 season passes the team announced earlier this offseason an additional seating area named The Krewe’s Nest which will be located in the south end zone at Raymond James Stadium. The additional 3600 seats will increase the stadium’s capacity to nearly 70000. In order to make room for the additional temporary seats the standing room-only fan section on the south end zone concourse has been removed for this season.

Krewe’s Nest

Krewe’s Nest patrons will be able to purchase beverage and food items from the comfort of their seats through food vendors that will be stationed throughout the seating locations. The Buccaneers and Tampa Sports Authority have collaborated to ensure that fans continue to have the ability to cross from the west side of the stadium to the east through a dedicated pass-thru lane that has been established behind the seating platform. Existing restrooms on the south concourse will also remain accessible.

“The addition of The Krewe’s Nest for this season is going to play a huge role in helping us create an unmatched atmosphere for games at Raymond James Stadium” said Buccaneers Chief Operating Officer Brian Ford. “We are always focused on finding ways to create the best gameday experiences for our members and this is another example of that.”

Buccaneers’ Fast Lane

Additionally the team has introduced its first-ever expedited entry lane at Raymond James Stadium through an innovative activation with its partners at Fifth Third Bank. In July the Buccaneers and Fifth Third Bank debuted a team-branded debit card that provides cardholders with a variety of perks including access to the Fifth Third Bank Gate Fast Lane as well as discounts on food and merchandise throughout the stadium.

“With nearly 70000 fans expected at every home game this season the Fifth Third Bank Gate Fast Lane will be a terrific addition to the gameday experience for those cardholders to ensure an efficient and worry-free entry through the gates” said Ford.

More Food More Better

And once inside the stadium Buccaneers fans will be treated to an even greater selection of new and upgraded food offerings from Legends the team’s hospitality rights partner since 2019.

Hyundai Club and East Stadium Club patrons will now have access to food offerings from local favorites PDQ and Aussie Grill in addition to specialty food offerings including a New York strip sandwich pork carnitas tacos calzones and Brauhaus pretzels. On the main concourse new offerings will include a footlong hot dog loaded yucca fries loaded tater tots and bang bang shrimp tatchos. New items in the upper concourse will include a bacon and cheese all beef burger pork carnitas tacos citrus chicken nachos and a portable cart with various healthy food options.

“We know that the quality and selection of food offerings plays a large role in the gameday experience and that is why we have worked closely with our hospitality partners at Legends to continue raising the bar on all food and beverage throughout Raymond James Stadium” said Ford. “Our fans have grown accustomed to enjoying the best hospitality options and we look forward to continuing to exceed their expectations.”

Cashless Experience

As in past years Raymond James Stadium continues to be a cashless facility with all retail transactions requiring a credit or debit card. For the convenience of fans there are reverse cash ATMs located throughout the stadium. All parking lots are also cashless. Fans attending games at Raymond James Stadium are also reminded that there is a no-bag policy in effect for all events.

At least that’s how Jay and Jessica Rybak saw it Saturday night.

Like myriad other Bucs patrons the married season-ticket holders from Bonita Springs were a bit jarred upon approaching their seats in the lower level of Raymond James Stadium’s south end zone. Directly above them where a sprawling walkway Tiki bar and various concessions once existed was a wide block of new makeshift seats.

“We’re kinda like ‘Where do we get drinks?’ said Jessica Rybak standing where the concourse once existed. “Because we’re used to coming right here so we’re trying to figure out like ‘Where do we go now?’”

So I went downstairs and checked out the new seating area in the south end zone. There ARE restrooms and concessions on the corridor behind the seats. #Bucs @RJStadium pic.twitter.com/i4NouF6FYc — Joey Knight (@TBTimes_Bulls) August 13 2022

Dubbed “The Krewe’s Nest” the additional 3600 seats debuted to mixed reviews (based on in-person and social media feedback) at the Bucs’ preseason opener against the Dolphins. A narrow “pass-thru” lane directly behind the section featured restrooms and some concession areas.

But not nearly the mingling space to which longtime stadium occupants are accustomed.

“Holy claustrophobia Batman” Sickles High assistant principal (and USF season-ticket holder) Joe Humphrey tweeted.

Others — namely those who had attempted in vain to purchase season tickets in the past — were delighted. The addition of the seats increases stadium capacity to nearly 70000.

“I was just telling my wife (Melissa) we absolutely love them” said Odessa’s David James who recently snagged season tickets in the section for himself and his wife of 27 years. “It looks phenomenal the seats are great. We’re excited about it.”

The BYU Cougars are preparing for their cross-country trek that will help the Bulls begin one of the most highly-anticipated seasons in recent memory.

USF head coach Jeff Scott enters his third year at the helm with new coordinators on both sides of the ball and another revamp of his roster in the books that saw the Bulls welcome in a boatload of transfers.

We started this series last season but didn’t finish it so our hope at Bulls247 is to follow through and execute - just as USF hopes to do on the field. Today continues our countdown of who we feel are the Bulls’ 25 most important players heading into the 2022 campaign.

A few disclaimers - this is a subjective opinion our word is not gospel and most likely won’t be what actually plays out in the 2021 season. Also this is a ‘most important’ list centered more around that second list. Players on this list will be evaluated more by their expected impact on the team’s overall success. This is not a ’25 best players on USF’s roster’ list.

No. 21: DB Matthew Hill

Admittedly the Georgia native wasn’t on our shortlist when we first started putting these rankings together. That’s what a good fall camp will do apparently.

Hill’s been called not just a “star” but one of the “clear stars” of 2022’s fall camp through the first ten practices that included Saturday’s scrimmage. His role is expected to increase drastically for Bob Shoop’s secondary after Vince ""Smoke"" Davis was forced to step away from football as Hill is likely to fill the role of the nickel back or STAR position which is a hybrid outside linebacker/safety that Davis played over the last two seasons.

Last season Hill’s first in Tampa saw him start the ten games he played in at strong safety a position that he hadn’t played in a large role since his time at Brookwood High (Lawrenceville Ga.) considering he was recruited to Auburn as a wide receiver.

There were games where he looked like a natural in the position and there were others where he graded out at the bottom of USF’s PFF grades for the week. There were certainly flashes of a good safety in his play Hill just needed to get more reps and be put in the right position to succeed which appeared to be a problem with several Bulls on the defensive side of the ball.

He posted 50 tackles in 2021 including a career-high 11 at SMU eight vs. Florida A&M and seven at NC State where he also had his first-career interception at the collegiate level.

#USF INT! Matthew Hill shows some WR hands transfer from Auburn making his mark in game 1! pic.twitter.com/XV9xzztxEh — ?????? ???????????????? (@ZacOnTheMic) September 3 2021

An injury suffered against Houston kept him out of the Cincinnati game then after giving it a go before exiting at Tulane Hill missed the finale at UCF.

Someone will need to step up into that nickel back position after Davis’ retirement from the game and from all indications it appears that Hill can be the one to provide the spark. He’s been consistently talked about as one of the most-improved players on this roster so it will be very interesting to see how it manifests on the field in 2022.

“Matt Hill has been off the charts at that position in training camp here. He’s put together really six good practices” Shoop said Thursday. “He’s in great peak physical condition. He’s showed toughness that I was probably not aware of that he had. He’s got really good athletic ability and he’s playing with great energy and enthusiasm very very passionate in his approach each day.”"

The new XMG NEO 17 gaming laptop features an interesting 16:10 aspect ratio display with a native 2560 x 1600 resolution CHERRY's MX ULP Tactile switches on the keyboard the AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX processor and up to NVIDIA's fastest GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile GPU.

Popular Now: Scientists use supercomputer to find out when humanity will perish

Inside the XMG NEO 17 gaming laptop has the 8-core 16-thread Ryzen 9 6900HX processor and 3 x GPU choices from NVIDIA: the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti. The flagship NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Mobile GPU has 16GB of GDDR6 memory and a 175W TGP (split into 150W + 25W through Dynamic Boost 2.0 technology) but can be run at full power permanently for the ultimate in performance all the time.

Speaking of full power permanently for the ultimate in performance the AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX processor can also spool up to 65W under full load continuously boosting up to 85W at peak power consumption.

But XMG is doing something different with its XMG 17 and XMG 15 gaming laptops: the optional XMG OASIS external laptop liquid cooling system. If you do opt for the liquid cooling system you'll get much quieter noise levels from your XMG 17 or XMG 15 gaming laptop as the liquid cooling system will keep your CPU and GPU cooler.

XMG's new NEO 17 gaming laptop is the first laptop in the XMG range that uses a 16:10 aspect ratio with a native resolution of 2560 x 1600 (1600p) and refresh rate of 240Hz. 1600p at 240Hz is pretty damn awesome so the Ryzen 9 6900HX and GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be used heavily in games at that resolution and refresh rate.

There's a 6ms response time on the panel NVIDIA G-SYNC support and Advanced Optimus technology that automatically switches the display from the integrated GPU on the AMD Ryzen 9 6800X and dedicated GPU in the NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU that you choose inside... all without a restart of your system.

You've got up to 64GB of DDR5-4800 supported inside of the XMG NEO 17 gaming laptop through 2 x SO-DIMM slots as well as 2 x M.2 slots for some super-fast PCIe 4.0 SSD storage.

16 16

On the outside you've got the same stellar connectivity with HDMI 2.1 for 4K 120Hz support enthusiast-grade 2.5GbE ethernet USB 3.2 Type-C port with integrated DisplayPort 1.4 stream and connection to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU.

XMG NEO 17: High-end laptop with Ryzen 9 6900HX RTX 3080 Ti CHERRY MX switches 16:10 display and optional liquid cooling

Designed for maximum performance XMG adds two models with AMD's Ryzen 6900HX to its NEO series. The NEO 17 has been completely redesigned and features a keyboard with CHERRY's MX ULP Tactile switches a 16:10 display with 2560 x 1600 pixels a 99 Wh battery and a revised cooling system that can fully exploit the power limits of the graphics card (up to the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti).

The NEO 15 on the other hand is a platform update based on the existing chassis.

The new AMD edition (generation M22 model) is compatible with the external XMG OASIS laptop liquid cooling system and in contrast to the Intel version introduced at the beginning of the year (model generation E22) is fully VR-compatible.

16 16

XMG has even provided some benchmark numbers between the air cooling and external liquid cooling on its NEO 17 gaming laptop where the stock air cooler inside of the XMG NEO 17 can keep the CPU cool enough to run the Ryzen 9 6900HX processor ar around 70W 15W less than the liquid cooling -- no surprise but awesome to see -- from the external liquid cooling tech XMG is using.

16 16

But the numbers are VERY different using its liquid cooling system benching the AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX processor and GeForce RTX 3080 Ti inside of the XMG NEO 17 gaming laptop with CPU package power tests -- where it held at 85W or so with the liquid cooler.

16 16

Now down to the nitty-gritty with GPU temperatures between the air vs liquid cooling inside of the XMG NEO 17 gaming laptop we have the air cooling on the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti keeping temps at around 80C+ while the liquid cooler keeps it much much cooler at just 60C.

16 16

3DMark Time Spy stress tests pushed the GPU power to 175W on the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU inside of the XMG NEO 17 while GPU temps were at 80C solid on the air cooling inside of the stock version of the NEO 17.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s happened to everyone — you’re presented with an iPad to pay for your purchase and a screen appears asking how much you want to tip. The problem is you’re at a coffee shop bakery fast food restaurant or other establishment where tipping wasn’t previously a thing.

Here It Is: Our 2022 Small Business Spotlight

Learn: 7 Things You Should Never Do When Planning for Retirement

But since the option is now in front of you the pressure is on to leave a tip — even if you don’t necessarily feel it’s warranted. However you want to handle the situation correctly so you can proudly show your face at the business again.

Pamela Eyring president of The Protocol School of Washington said that while it is discretionary tipping at checkout is appropriate — if you receive extra service.

“If they greet you by remembering your name and giving you eye contact with a smile sharing any specials or new items they repeat your order in detail — just the way you ordered it — and are friendly — not just barely acknowledging your presence” she said. “Or if someone delivers food to your home or brings it out to your car you could consider a tip.”

She said you can also opt to give a tip to be extra kind. “Times are tough” she said. “If you’re in good shape financially providing gratuity is an appropriate act of kindness.”



If there happens to be a tip jar next to the iPad prompting you for a tip she recommended choosing the cash option. “Cash is still king” she said. “Tipping in cash is always appreciated because there are no deductions.”

While that’s all fine and good Maryanne Parker — founder of Manor of Manners an etiquette consulting firm based in San Diego — said you also don’t need to feel guilty about not leaving extra at common spots where people don’t necessarily expect to tip. Let’s go through a few of these places.

Coffee Shops

“Most of the time in the coffee shop we are not served; we simply order the coffee and wait a few minutes to grab it and go on with our daily routine” Parker said. “We can round up the bill — for example if the coffee is $2.50 we definitely can leave $0.50 extra — but we are certainly not obligated.”

Take Our Poll: Do You Tip for Service?

Bakeries

“I love the donut shop nearby and I often get donuts for my family” she said. “At times if I purchase a dozen they might add an extra donut. I always give them a little tip because I love their generosity.”

However she said if she just purchases a donut and a coffee she might just round up the bill or opt not to tip at all if she doesn’t have change.

Story continues

“The service is still great but it is not time-consuming just to pick up a donut” she said.

Fast Food Restaurants

You might feel pressured to tip at a local fast food restaurant but Parker said there’s no obligation. “I do not tip at my local taco shop every single time” she said. “However I am a regular customer and they know that I will be back and support their business.”

She said she isn’t able to tip on every trip to the restaurant but shows her support by being their customer.

“A good business won’t be upset if we do not leave a tip every time” she said. “Depending on how time-consuming our order was and if it was a takeaway it shouldn’t be that complicated and we can just move on without tipping every single time we see the tip option on the iPad.”

Ultimately Parker said tipping should always feel like your choice. “Many people believe that in the U.S. the tipping practice is a little excessive” she said. “However from an etiquette perspective we should tip based only on good service.”

Therefore she disagrees with the idea that you need to tip regardless of the quality of service you receive.

“Tipping for any kind of service even a bad one doesn’t help the purpose of tipping” she said.

Since leaving gratuity is supposed to be a show of appreciation for receiving excellent service she said there can be further implications for unwarranted tipping.



“If I did experience bad service and I am required to tip — based on people’s opinions or exaggerated charges — I would leave the establishment frustrated and unhappy” she said. “On another hand the customer service will start deteriorating because the wait staff won’t work for their tip because they will be expecting it either way.”

So there you have it — the next time you’re faced with an iPad at checkout prompting you to leave a tip you don’t feel is necessary you can opt out guilt-free.

Workers at the firm’s European headquarters in Raheen have as part of National Heritage Week Ireland been helping to preserve the historic gothic revival style home which was built around 1830.

Located in the centre of the Regeneron campus the building was once home to one of Limerick’s representatives in the Houses of Parliament in London pre-independence.

The land around the complex was acquired by the firm in 2018.

To ensure the longevity of Roche Castle as an important historic entity Regeneron invested in extensive preservation and restoration work as part of its biodiversity and conservation initiative.

In addition to the restoration of the castle an extensive woodland project has seen a range of actions taken on the surrounding 1.22-hectare area including removal of scrub and non-native vegetation on the woodland floor and reseeding of the floor with native woodland flora; a butterfly sunny glade area; installation of solitary bee hotels bird boxes and bat boxes; and the creation of wood stacks to provide habitats for invertebrates at various locations within the woodlands.

Daniel Van Plew executive vice-president and general manager of industrial operations and product supply said: “Regeneron tries its best to be a good neighbour and when you think about your friends and family members that work with us we truly are part of this neighbourhood. As part of the Limerick community – like any good neighbour we try our best to have a positive impact.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJjaXJjbGUuaW4vZW5nYWdlL2dldC1pbnNwaXJlZC9hY2hpZXZlcnMvaG93LXRlZW5hZ2UtdGVjaC1nZW5pdXMtanVpLWtlc2thcnJzcXVvcy1wYXJraW5zb25yc3F1b3MtZGV2aWNlLW1ha2VzLWEtZGlmZmVyZW5jZS0zMTczLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jui Keskar Award-Winning Tech Genius Invented A Device That Measures Parkinson's Tremors | Her Circle,"How Teenage Tech Genius Jui Keskar’s Parkinson’s Device Makes A Difference

“It all began with the aim of wanting to help my uncle who is a Parkinson’s patient for the past 9 years. I feel extremely grateful and lucky that I have been provided the platform to showcase my innovation and help people” said Pune-based Jui Keskar a Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar (PMRBP) 2022 winner.

Keskar has invented JTremour 3D – a wearable device designed to measure and track limb movements and tremors by sending signals to a cloud-based system thereby guiding doctors in diagnosing and deciding the course of medication for Parkinson’s patients. Since then the 16-year-old has garnered immense recognition for her innovation. In addition to the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar Keskar has won the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Ignited Mind Children Creativity and Innovation Awards in 2020 and Grand Award at IRIS National Fair 2021 (3rd place in Biomedical engineering). In January 2021 she was also awarded the IRIS Grand Award recognised by ‘Broadcom Department of Science and Technology.’ Furthermore she represented India and won the Science Seed award at the ‘Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) in Pittsburgh USA.

“Parkinson’s is a medical condition that impacts the central nervous system of a patient manifesting as severe tremors in the limbs. Till today doctors prescribe medication based on how the patient describes the intensity of their tremors. This is not an accurate and scientific way since the medication is heavily dependent on the frequency of the said tremors. With this device I wanted to increase the efficiency of the treatment” explains Keskar.

“I have seen my uncle suffer and I always wanted to help him in any small way that I could thus during the lockdown began my research.” The tech genius went ahead to read various research papers and journals and also found a few existing devices to measure these tremors. However these lacked portability and wearability she said. “I wanted to make this device compact and affordable.”

Keskar is currently working on advancing the device and plans to work on many such tech innovations that will help the medical community. She also founded ‘Beat The Tremor Foundation’ (www.beatthetremor.org ) “While going through the comments from online community I realised that a huge information gap exists among patients and families in towns and villages in India. ‘Beat The Tremor Foundation’ intents to bridge this gap with the mission to support the patients of Parkinson's Disease in India.",,,,,,,,,

Republic Services a division of Consolidated Waste has a multi-year contract with the City that came under scrutiny for the high price to residents. Former councilwoman Judy Dunlap alerted the District Attorney’s office that Mayor James T. Butts voted twice to enter into exclusive negotiations with Republic after they hired his brother.

The FBI interviewed representatives from the three companies that submitted bids to the City and an investigation by the District Attorney’s office then under the leadership of Jackie Lacey lost the investigation file. They mayor was never charged with any wrondoing.

The video shows a driver taking trash out of the truck and throwing it on the resident’s lawn. It is unclear why.

The City announced a couple of weeks ago they were going up on the trash rates in order to provide decreased restrictions of on-street parking during collection days.

Residents aren’t allowed to park on the street between 8am and 3pm for trash collection and street sweeping however during the July 19 regular city council meeting the council unanimously approved reducing the timeframe to 7am – 1pm.

The action approved signage which the staff report details was “on order” and were due to be installed by the end of the last month which did not happen.

During the Aug. 9 regular city council meeting a resident called in inquiring on when signage related to the permit parking program would be installed considering the NFL season kicks off in Inglewood Aug. 13. The mayor instructed him to contact Public Works.

City Hall insiders share the Public Works department is in disarray with reduced personnel not meeting commitments to the public regarding signage and a member of their staff was recorded driving in the carpool lane solo while holding a cellphone to his ear.

Hazen the wife of Diamondbacks General Manager Mike Hazen was remembered for her ability to connect with people and forge strong friendships as well as for her passion for her family and teaching.

After her diagnosis in 2020 she continued teaching middle school English at St. Francis Xavier School until the end of 2021. In an effort to slow the advancement of the tumor she underwent a biopsy three craniotomies and a surgical revision due to a possible infection. She also tried three different drug therapies.

She left behind four sons between the ages of 12 and 16. Mike Hazen who spoke on Saturday delivered powerful and heartfelt remarks much of which was aimed at his boys. He said he hoped they understood why he had been constantly reminding them to hug their mother whenever they walked into or out of a room with her.

“It wasn’t just so I could torment you to hug your mom again” he said. “It was that I wanted you to have a lifetime of hugs from mom for however much time we had because I know you’ll never forget how much your mom loves you and I never wanted you to forget her embrace.”

He continued: “If there is one thing I could ask you to carry on in her legacy it would be to be a magnet for good people. Your mother was like a moth to a flame for good people.”

Rick Ferrara Nicole’s brother said his sister had a way of easily connecting with people — “It was just her gift” he said — and that she was intertwined in so many of his childhood memories in part because she was always so welcoming of him despite his status as the younger sibling.

“Even though I was the younger brother and could have been excluded she kept me involved” he said. “I was her friend too. That might explain why my first concert ever was Debbie Gibson and my second one was New Kids on the Block.”

Mike Hazen remembered a moment at spring training from his time working for the Boston Red Sox when Nicole wrangled their boys away from a golf cart being driven by former third baseman Frank Malzone.

“When she walked away he pulled me aside and said ‘You know what? I like that wife of yours. She’s a real pistol’” Hazen recalled. “She was a real pistol all right.”

How is that going to influence the way you present this guy who's going to become a loremaster but he's got to lead armies he's going to be at all these huge events wielding swords and spears and all that stuff?

For him it's about duty. I'm not sure yet that he's realized his greatest strength and he has many different parts of what he achieves in his life you could point to and be like ""That was amazing and that was [also] amazing."" He achieved this and that's incredible. What's at the bottom of it is what is necessary. At this moment [it is necessary] to serve something that's greater than himself.

I feel like when you've come from your dad and your mom served the world and your brother created one of the greatest nations that's ever existed and then here you are the Herald of Gil-galad it's a lot to live up to. It's a lot of pressure. He is connected [and] his greatest decisions will come from that will come from necessity from need. That's where his choices come from and love emotionality.

When I read about him I'm always really interested in the way that Tolkien talks about [how Elrond is] counted amongst the immortals which is an interesting thing. Counted it doesn't necessarily say that he is one. Technically he's immortal but to me it suggests something interesting about what mortality means to him and literally what mortality is inside of him. If you had to cut him up he's immortal but ""What does half-elven mean?"" was one of the most interesting questions about creating him.

I love the fact that he's got a little bit of Maiar in him and so does Aragorn.

1/16th I think.

Aragorn's a little bit less but still this isn't a cut and dry issue right?

No definitely not. He is the mutt of the legendarium. Everything feeds into him and it's why he was given the choice in the first place. If you look at where he comes from — I read this thing — he's 1/16th Maiar and 8/16th this. It's mental if you wanted to break it down so it makes a lot of sense that he was given the choice.",,,,,,
ROK,Rockwell Automation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL2V2aWwtcGxjLWNvdWxkLXR1cm4tcGxjcy1pbnRvLWF0dGFjay12ZWN0b3Jz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Evil PLC' could turn PLCs into attack vectors,"Claroty published a set of 11 new vendor-specific vulnerabilities that would allow for a programmable logic controller to serve as an attack vector. For Rockwell the company used a a deserialization attack. (a Rockwell Automation Employee CC BY-SA 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons)

Usually when you think about someone hacking a programmable logic controller the PLC is the final target of the attack. Adversaries use other systems to get to what will ultimately let them create some kind of industrial havoc.

But a DefCon presentation from Claroty Team 82 poses a question: what if someone used a PLC as a vector rather than the destination?

“Evil PLC” is what the researchers believe is a novel attack scenerio: infecting whichever engineer communicates with a PLC with malicious code. As a proof of viability Claroty published a set of 11 new vendor-specific vulnerabilities that would allow for the attack. Those vulnerabilities are found in Ovarro TBOX B&R (ABB) X20 System Schneider Electric Modicon M340 and M580 GE MarkVIe Rockwell Micro Control Systems Emerson PACSystems and Xinje XDPPro platforms. All but the Emerson were issued CVEs.

Click here for more news out of Black Hat 2022.

The idea stems from Claroty wanting to know more about the adversaries targeting their honeypots.

“We asked ourselves how can we actively attack the attackers? We don't know anything about them. We cannot find them” said Claroty director of research Sharon Brizinov. “And then we kind of had a eureka moment and we thought okay what if the PLC was to be weaponized?”

Claroty accomplished an Evil PLC using a ZipSlip attack against vendors (Emerson Ovarro B&R GE and Xinje) heap overflow against Schneider and a deserialization attack against Rockwell.

There are two attack scenarios that Claroty says Evil PLC would be appropriate for. The first would be if the PLC was the only vector into a secure facility. The attacker could wait for an engineer to connect to the PLC and infect the engineer workstation. That could be expedited by using the newfound access to the PLC to encourage an early inspection.

“Once the attacker weaponized the PLC maybe they deliberately cause a fault on the PLC. The engineer would be lured to the PLC to check what's going on with it” said Brizinov.

Another scenario would be to take advantage of the number of PLCs serviced by outside engineers. One engineer connecting to one PLC could spread malicious code across several enterprises.

“Usually PLCs are the crown jewel. When we're talking about classic attack vectors in ICS domains we're always seeing the PLC as the endpoint the end goal; but if we're playing with those ideas and shifting our thoughts a bit we can we can get to new ways of how to defend and attack both networks” Brizinov said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Minneapolis retailer made visible strides in that time but a review of its benchmarks shows it still has a way to go to meet all of its goals.

Target increased its share of Black company officers added more year-round products by Black entrepreneurs and expanded its base of contractors. While some experts suggest retailers' interest in diversity is declining Target executives vow to stay the course.

""You would never have a financial office that didn't set goals that didn't set targets"" said Kiera Fernandez Target's chief diversity and inclusion officer. ""We have to have that same mindset when we think of diversity equity and inclusion.""

Target leaders say they had already begun work to better serve Black workers and customers when Floyd's murder on Memorial Day 2020 led to more calls for action about ending the unfair treatment of Black people in America.

In summer 2020 Target formed the REACH (Racial Equity Action and Change) committee to spearhead some new lofty visions such as creating retail environments in which Black customers felt welcomed and finding new ways to help grow the prosperity of Black communities.

Target has since added more tangible benchmarks and financial commitments including promising to contribute $100 million through 2025 to Black-led organizations; spend more than $2 billion on Black-owned businesses including marketing agencies and construction companies by the end of 2025; and spend 5% of Target's annual media budget on Black-owned media this year.

Target is not the only company to focus more on diversity and equity since Floyd's death. Retailers including Nordstrom Sephora Macy's Ulta Beauty and the Gap have accepted the Fifteen Percent Pledge which was launched in 2020 to advocate for Black businesses to make up 15% of retailers' shelf space.

""The pandemic mixed with social changes has made many consumers demand more from their retailers"" said Kim Sovell a marketing professor at the University of St. Thomas. ""I'm not talking about good prices. I'm talking about thoughtfulness.""

According to McKinsey & Co. nearly half of consumers they recently surveyed in the United States believe companies should pledge to support Black-owned brands and vendors with a larger percentage of younger consumers including Gen Zers and millennials thinking that's important. Also Black consumers who have historically been underserved have hundreds of billions of dollars of buying power that they are willing to redirect research shows.

At Target one of the REACH committee's big priorities has been to increase the variety of products by Black founders. Target currently offers more than 100 Black-owned items which the retailer began to label in 2020. Target now aims to sell more than 500 products from Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025.

Tabitha Brown is one of the latest Black designers that Target has partnered with.

One of Target's new partnerships has been with Black actress and social media influencer Tabitha Brown. She recently released the second of her four colorful Target collections of apparel home goods and kitchenware.

""I love fashion and I studied fashion in school and that was one of my dreams to do clothing and a line and never would I have ever dreamt that my first [assortment] would have been at Target"" Brown said.

Brown who is 43 said when she was growing up she didn't see a lot of Black girls and women represented at major retailers.

""We deserve to be in spaces with everybody else"" she said. ""We deserve to be seen. We deserve to be heard. And so I think the world has finally caught on to that.""

In another improvement Target said it doubled the amount of its Black-owned partners since 2020. Target is finalizing an advertising partnership with Sheletta Brundidge a local Black comedian and radio host who criticized Target last year for not supporting Twin Cities Black media outlets.

""People are asking for receipts"" Brundidge said. ""Did you honor your commitments? Did you do what you said you are going to do?""

Target plans to buy ads on Brundidge's podcast network. General Mills is another recent sponsor for her podcast she said.

""We aren't going to have no Black businesses if our Fortune 500 companies don't hire us as vendors"" Brundidge said. ""It's long overdue.""

Target also increased the number of Black workers in higher positions. Last fiscal year 10% of its officers were Black up from 5% in 2019. Black employees accounted for 15.5% of its overall workforce last year compared to 15.6% in 2019.

The retailer has also experienced some difficult moments. Last year several employees at the St. Paul Midway Target complained about a Juneteenth break room display they said played into Black stereotypes with a table of cherry Kool-Aid packets watermelon candy and servings of hot sauce.

Some have also pointed out that the retailer over the years has closed Target stores in urban Black neighborhoods.

Target representatives said it follows a rigorous process to evaluate the performance of every store and the company continues to stay committed to open locations that serve all customers including new stores in Flatbush a neighborhood in New York City and Los Angeles' Inglewood neighborhood.

Lul Osman shopped for body wash at Target earlier this month.

Jesse Ross a Minneapolis-based diversity and inclusion consultant said he thinks many companies who were vocal about supporting racial equity in the wake of Floyd's death have begun to turn their focus to other business challenges.

""I think the stamina for folks committed to these diversity goals has changed. ... The majority of the culture doesn't want to do the work"" Ross said.

Fernandez acknowledges some diversity goals may not be reached in the time that Target originally wanted. She also said that despite strategies and policies it is still possible for individual employees to make mistakes that could go against Target's inclusivity intentions. There's ""no endpoint"" to the company's diversity efforts Fernandez said.

""We are not perfect"" she said. ""We are in pursuit of equity inclusion and a place where everyone is seen and valued. And along the way we will bump our head and bump our toe because we are all humans.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lLzIwMjIvMDgvMTMvdGFtcGEtd29tYW4tZmFjZXMtbWFuc2xhdWdodGVyLWNoYXJnZS1hZnRlci1zaG9vdGluZy1ib3lmcmllbmQtYW5kLWxlYXZpbmctaGltL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tampa woman faces manslaughter charge after shooting boyfriend and leaving him,"TAMPA — Calvin Oliver followed his girlfriend inside a home after she came outside wielding a gun. Minutes later a witness heard a gunshot. Oliver was found later with a gunshot wound to his head according to an arrest affidavit.

Cicelia Shanz Thomas 27 was arrested by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Monday on a manslaughter charge after deputies say she shot Oliver 42. Thomas admitted to deputies that she pointed the gun at Oliver knowing the gun was loaded and pulled the trigger according to the affidavit.

According to the affidavit on Aug. 6 around 8 p.m. Oliver and a 42-year-old man were outside shooting pellets at a dartboard in front of a home in the 12700 block of N Central Avenue in Tampa. After a few minutes Thomas came outside aiming a silver gun at the dartboard.

Both Oliver and the 42-year-old shouted their concern and told Thomas to put the gun back in the house. The 42-year-old watched as Thomas went back inside the house with the gun and Oliver followed.

Five or 10 minutes passed the affidavit states when the man heard a gunshot. Minutes later he saw someone pacing inside the home.

According to the affidavit Thomas later came outside and told the 42-year-old that Oliver accidentally shot himself but he was “alright.” She told the 42-year-old she had called an ambulance and that he could leave.

The 42-year-old left the house and went to his home about a mile away. According to the affidavit the man intended to call 911 when he got home because he didn’t have his phone with him at the time of shooting. A short time later the man went back to the Central Avenue home. When he arrived at 10:30 p.m. there were no ambulances and the house looked empty the affidavit said.

The 42-year-old knocked on the door multiple times but there was no answer. The man was scared that Thomas was still at the house and he left. He came back about an hour later and talked with a 56-year-old man and expressed his concern over what happened earlier.

Both men decided to check on Oliver and they found the front door was unlocked the affidavit said.

When they walked inside they heard a wheezing sound and they found Oliver in a bedroom with a gunshot wound to his head. One of the men called 911 and Oliver was taken to Florida Advent Hospital where he died.

Deputies could not find Thomas during the initial investigation the affidavit said.

The following day when deputies were notifying Oliver’s sister of his death she asked unprompted if Thomas was involved in the investigation. Thomas has known the family for many years his sister said and Oliver and Thomas have a child together.

Deputies found Thomas on Monday. She admitted she knew the gun was loaded when she aimed the gun at Oliver’s head and pulled the trigger. Thomas told deputies that she called an ambulance and left the house afterward the affidavit said. She left the gun sitting on the bed she said.

Thomas is also facing a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm according to the affidavit.

According to Hillsborough court records Thomas was arrested in October on charges of carrying a concealed firearm and for improperly exhibiting the gun. According to an arrest affidavit Thomas had a gun visibly by her side while at Citrus Park Mall and at the Ross Dress For Less 12775 Citrus Plaza Dr. in Tampa.

A few days after the October incident a petition granting a risk protection order was placed on Thomas. Sometimes called a “red-flag order” they allow a judge to order a person’s weapons to be seized.

Thomas was being held at the Hillsborough County jail without bail on Saturday according to records.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3RoZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYnJhc2thLWV4dGVuc2lvbi1wcm92aWRlcy1pbi1maWVsZC10cmFpbmluZy1vbi1jb3JuLXNveWJlYW4tcHJvZHVjdGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlXzkyZGFiMWRlLTFiNWMtMTFlZC05MGQyLWFiMmZjMzkxZTlmNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nebraska Extension provides in-field training on corn soybean production,"LINCOLN — Nebraska Extension will provide in-field training opportunities during Crop Management Diagnostic Clinics later this month.

Aug 13 2022 (Bloomberg) –Cruise ships are filling up again but passengers have been reporting back quicker than crew members.

Carnival Corp.’s Princess Cruises this week canceled 11 fall sailings on its Diamond Princess saying it couldn’t provide the level of service customers expect amid ongoing labor shortages. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. another large operator told investors it’s had to limit capacity on the Pride of America because of staffing. The ship which sails the Hawaiian islands is required to have a crew that’s mostly US citizens a tall order in this tight labor market.

“We’re not immune to it” Norwegian’s chief executive officer Frank Del Rio said of industrywide labor shortages.

Even though cruise lines have been relaxing requirements for Covid tests and reporting stronger bookings it’s still been choppy sailing. Norwegian shares fell 11% on Aug. 9 after the company forecast a loss in the current quarter as it continues to deal with challenges such as the pandemic the Russia-Ukraine conflict and “current macroeconomic conditions.” The stock has since rebounded.

Princess’s cancellations comes after a rocky few months. P&O Cruises another Carnival division canceled seven voyages earlier this summer due to staffing shortages. But other adjustments have been more subtle. Carnival Cruise Line the company’s namesake brand scaled back some of its offerings this summer including suspending some special events like its parties for loyal cruisers and instead provided perks like onboard credit or cocktail vouchers. Now those events have returned.

Still missing and likely gone for the foreseeable future are the 24/7 pizzerias.

“There will be pizza available for virtually the entire time most guests are awake” Chris Chiames a spokesman for Carnival Cruise Line said in an email. The company also scaled back its complimentary birthday cakes and a chocolate extravaganza buffet cuts made in part due to low staffing as well as general adjustments to match guest demand according to Chiames.

Carnival offered incentives including bonuses and greater contract flexibility to increase the number of staffers. Those have now been discontinued.

Jim Walker a Miami Florida-based maritime lawyer estimates that fewer than 5% of cruise-ship employees are American citizens or residents. He says long hours and low pay make most crew positions unattractive to domestic workers.

Most crew members hail from the Philippines Indonesia India and throughout the Caribbean islands according to Walker. Generally non-US citizens require a visa to work on ships that travel in and out of American ports.

The number of visas processed by the State Department declined as much as 90% during the pandemic according to Jorge Loweree managing director of programs at the American Immigration Council an advocacy group. Around March the department’s overall issuance of visas rebounded to pre-pandemic levels but Loweree says the agency had to play catch up on two years of backlogs.

Long processing times have affected a range of industries from health care to construction and have cost immigrants their jobs as they await renewal.

Nathaniel Derrenbacher a spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. the second-largest operator said his company hasn’t canceled any voyages due to staffing.

“Like most businesses we’ve faced challenges outside of our control while we bring our staffing back to full capacity” Derrenbacher wrote in an email.

While cruise operators have tried to maintain their offerings some passengers have complained of inadequate service. Linda Warhaftig said trash littered the decks of the Carnival Horizon and Conquest when she sailed on them in June. The 59-year-old who has been on 65 cruises said such a sight would have been unimaginable before the pandemic.

“After what I witnessed in June I canceled my Carnival cruises for the rest of this year” Warhaftig said.

Carnival spokesman Chiames said the line had an extremely busy summer with most ships sailing full. “We know our guests deserve a great vacation and if there were times when we fell short we certainly apologize” he said.

Despite the setbacks bookings remain high and consumer sentiment is robust according to Jefferies Group analyst David Katz.

“I think there’s some expectation that service levels are not going to be just yet what they had been” he said.

As an industry they are saying that they are following the advice of medical professionals and working to reflect the societal norms in many parts of the world.

The move to drop one of the last key restrictions for travelers comes just a month after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ended its COVID oversight program of the cruise industry. In July the CDC quietly withdrew its voluntary COVID protocols under which ships reported cases of the virus and continued restrictions ranging from pre-cruise testing to requirements that most passengers and crew be vaccinated. While saying the risks remained and that it would continue to provide guidance to the cruise lines and travelers the CDC cited the progress of the cruise lines and the strong protocols in place.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings the parent company of Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises was the first to confirm the shift in policy making the announcement on August 8 saying it was moving to align the company with the broader travel leisure and hospitality industry. Vaccinated guests aged 12 and over will no longer have any pre-cruise COVID-19 related protocols and unvaccinated guests may embark with a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours prior to departure subject to local regulations according to the policies posted to the three cruise lines’ websites.

“Our long-awaited revisions to our testing and vaccination requirements bring us closer in line with the rest of society which has learned to adapt and live with COVID-19 and makes it simpler and easier for our loyal guests” said Frank Del Rio President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. “The relaxation of protocols coupled with continued easing of travel restrictions and the reopening to cruise in more ports around the globe are meaningfully positive for our business as it reduces friction expands the addressable cruise market brings variety to itineraries and provides additional catalysts on the road to recovery.”

By week’s end the Royal Caribbean Group which owns Royal Caribbean International Celebrity Cruises and Silversea as well as Carnival Corporation had followed suit with a similar end to the vaccination requirements. Carnival Corporation’s brands from Carnival Cruise Line to Holland America Princess Cunard and others all quickly announced the changes to their policies also due to take effect in early September.

""Our ships have been sailing very full all summer but there is still room for more of our loyal guests and these guidelines will make it a simpler process and make cruising accessible for those who were not able to meet the protocols we were required to follow for much of the past 14 months"" said Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line.

While travelers were pleased to hear the news the end to the requirement varies both by destination and length of cruise. In most cases they are still keeping the rules in place for longer cruises lasting more than 16-days. In addition many foreign destinations are still requiring that passengers be vaccinated for the cruise ships to visit their ports.

The end of the vaccination requirement however is still seen as a key step in the efforts for the industry to rebound. Marking one year since cruises resumed from U.S. ports Carnival Cruise Line at the beginning of August highlighted that it has welcomed back three million passengers to its ships. They said that some of their ships were expected to operate with as high as 110 percent of occupancy (meaning they are using third and fourth berths in cabins mostly for families).

Major cruise companies have reported a strong rebound in occupancy. Royal Caribbean International for example said during its second quarter occupancy was back to 84 percent with it reaching 90 percent in June and some Caribbean voyages over 100 percent for the summer. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings operated with a lower 65 percent occupancy during the second quarter as the corporation sought to limit discounts and drive cash flow from operations. The company turned cash positive in March 2022 and generated approximately $260 million in cash from operations in the second quarter.

The industry’s optimism is driven by strong future sales. All the cruise lines report strong future bookings. Norwegian for example in this week’s earnings report said this quarter set a new record for total advance ticket sales and the prices were at record levels for the full year 2023. The end of the vaccination requirements is seen as another encouraging step and the cruise lines are hopeful that as problems recede with air travel that their bookings and occupancy will continue to rise.

That's really important especially because he recently took the reins of Carnival Corporation whose nine cruise lines comprise the biggest cruise brand in the world.

But for Weinstein Carnival Corp.'s president and CEO since August 1 2022 it's not just about the numbers. He's a cruise fan and has been from the beginning when he took his first cruise as a new Carnival Cruise Line employee. That sailing was nearly 20 years ago when he was working for the company's legal team.

Ask Weinstein about that cruise and he lights up. You can hear the excitement in his voice as he speaks about that family cruise when he was finally able to connect what he was doing for Carnival with what it means to the people onboard the company's cruise ship. He calls it a ""light bulb"" moment and it continues to shape his decisions and direction even today.

""I remember being on a cruise experiencing it as a guest and seeing other guests and seeing our crew members interact with these folks"" Weinstein said. ""And we create happiness. That's our job. Our job is to make people happy. It was like an epiphany for me and as satisfied as I was with being part of a pretty fantastic team that has been something that's stayed with me for the last 20 years.""

In an exclusive interview with Cruise Critic the first outlet he's spoken with since taking over the CEO job Weinstein talks about how happiness drives his decision making what his long-term vision for the company is and why it's so important for each of the company's nine brands to maintain distinct personalities.

Married and the father of three teenagers Weinstein said he loves cruising for many of the same reasons we all do. It's a convenient way to see the world requiring packing and unpacking only once and he loves connecting to the people he sails with. He also talks about how cruising is ideal for group and extended family cruising allowing everyone to tailor the cruise experience for themselves.

Former Leadership Casts Big Shadow But Weinstein's No Rookie

Weinstein 48 has big shoes to fill. He's at the helm of a company that has seen only three CEOs before him: Founder Ted Arison his son Micky Arison who led the company for more than 30 years and Arnold Donald a beloved figure who was named CEO in 2013 when Micky Arison stepped down.

When Donald announced in April that he'd be leaving the CEO role this summer it had industry insiders buzzing. After all Richard Fain had recently left his position as head of Royal Caribbean Group (replaced by Jason Liberty) and Donald had been a steady hand as the cruise giant worked toward recovery through a pandemic that was harder on the cruise industry than on any other segment of travel.

To outsiders Weinstein as a replacement for Arnold Donald may have been a bit of a surprise but for those in the know it seemed like a no-brainer. Weinstein is a veteran of Carnival Corporation having started with the company two decades ago as legal counsel. He's had various roles since including almost a decade as the company's treasurer. He was president of Carnival U.K. leading Cunard and P&O Cruises for three years before being named chief operating officer. Weinstein took over as COO in June 2020 and is widely credited for helping lead the company through the global health pandemic.

Weinstein feels prepared for the role in part because he's learned from all the people he's worked with along the way including Donald CFO David Bernstein former Carnival Cruise Line President Bob Dickinson and current Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy.

""All of them just approach things differently think about the world differently"" Weinstein said. ""Their leadership styles are incredibly different. I think I've gone through a process over my career and a bit of a learning curve about. ... But I think what's common with all of them is they are so unique and they're so authentic. Every single one of them they are who they are and they don't try to be something that they're not.

""I can't be Bob Dickinson and I don't want to be. I can't be Arnold and I don't want to be.""

Weinstein's approach to leadership is part of the reason the company tapped him for the role and is so confident in his ability to steer Carnival Corporation toward a bright future.

Donald and Weinstein worked closely together over the years and Donald credits him with being ""very bright"" praising his transparency and openness.

In an interview with Cruise Critic in May 2022 Donald said of Weinstein ""he's different than me which is important and good. ... He's going to come at things a little bit differently.""

The fact that Weinstein's never held a similar position to his current role doesn't faze him. It's not the first time he's taken on a job for which he didn't have the background experience. He was named treasurer in 2007 and at the time he had no accounting finance or economic experience. But he learned relying on his team to help him learn how he could best support them. He said the same thing happened again when he led the UK team and when he was named COO.

""Part of the portion of the journey I had is that folks kept putting me into new roles that I had no background in"" Weinstein said adding ""I found myself working with some just incredibly talented folks ... who are just experts in their field and tremendous leaders and I get to learn from all of them.""

Carnival Corp's Nine Brands to Remain Distinct

Weinstein's background with a diversity of responsibilities and exposure to all of the company's brands has him uniquely positioned to lead. With a portfolio that includes Carnival Cruise Line Princess Cruises Holland America Line Seabourn Cunard Line P&O Cruises P&O Australia Costa Cruises and German-brand AIDA Carnival Corporation has cruise lines that satisfy nearly every taste.

In his first video message to his new employees Weinstein highlighted the importance of maintaining the distinct brands that authentically cater to their unique guest audiences. It's a cornerstone of Weinstein's long-term vision for the company.

""The same person who is looking for a three-night holiday on Carnival and fun boisterous loud in a very positive way is not necessarily the same person that's going to be looking to go on a Seabourn cruise to Antarctica"" Weinstein said.

Being able to provide options for all traveler tastes -- or at least as many as possible -- is both good for guests and good for business. Weinstein calls it the ""virtuous cycle"": Helping guests find the right line for them and delivering onboard on that promise makes it more likely they'll return again and again.

To that end Weinstein will continue to put much of the information-gathering and decision-making around each brand in the hands of those closest to them those who know the brands well.

Happiness is at the Core of Carnival Corp.

If you ask Weinstein what gets him excited each day his response will revolve around ""happiness.""

The surprisingly simple concept applies across the business to passengers and to employees. For guests it means delivering the best experience possible making sure smiles are big and expectations are exceeded.

""And all of our brands do it differently right? Because that idea of what is it that creates happiness for somebody who's on a Carnival cruise versus an AIDA cruise? It's all different and that's great. It should be different because it's a different target audience just like we've been talking about"" Weinstein said. ""But that's what we do and that's gotten me out of bed every single day for the last 20 years.""

But passenger satisfaction is just part -- albeit a big part -- of the equation. Weinstein says his aim is to keep employees happy as well because what he loves about cruising is the same thing that has many of us sailing again and again: the people. His goal is to create and maintain a workplace that offers a culture that encourages diversity personal and business growth and continuous training.

His ultimate goal is making Carnival the employer of choice in the travel and leisure industry.

""And trying to care for ... one another make sure that we are giving our team members the resources that they need training tools career growth not only to come start with us but stay with us becoming a more-inclusive environment seeking out different people's perspectives at all levels"" Weinstein said. ""All of those things will help us to achieve that. There's no silver bullet. It's just consistent improvement and focus on the people and what they need to succeed. That is a huge pillar for us as a company for me personally.""

Up First: Changing a Way of Thinking

As Weinstein thinks about the future one area of focus is on shifting mentality moving from a mindframe that helped the company successfully get back to service during the pandemic to one that drives a return to strong profitability.

Like virtually the entire cruise industry Carnival Corporation took on debt -- to the tune of roughly $35 billion -- during the pandemic. So the shift in mentality is certainly an understandable one.

The entire cruise industry was paused in March 2020 and for most brands cruising only started its slow return in late spring/early summer 2021. Ninety percent of the Carnival Corp. fleet is sailing and the remainder is expected to return by the end of the year Weinstein said. Speaking of the incredible uphill battle the cruise industry faced in return to service Weinstein is effusive in his praise of the determination perseverance resiliency and creativity that went into getting to this point.

""I can't understate how monumental that is"" he said. ""And at the same time it's hard to do but we have to almost compartmentalize that now and say 'Great we did whatever we needed to do to get back into service.' Now that we are here we can take a breath. ... It's our job to say 'Right now we get back to business.' ""

Part of the ""getting back to business"" connects directly to the company's drive to make people happy something Weinstein notes Carnival -- and the industry -- was unable to do for a year. But now delivering happiness will serve as a springboard to generate ""incredible amounts of revenue.""

With the elimination of CDC restrictions which held back a full cruise return for more than two years Weinstein believes the company is poised for profitability. Like the rest of the cruise industry Carnival Corp. had a number of rules in place including testing and vaccination mandates which the company is now ""responsibly relaxing.""

And that same thinking that has helped the company through the pandemic that creativity determination inclusivity and empowerment will now help secure Carnival Corporation's short- and long-term future.

""It's all just tools in the tool belt that are going to make us that much more successful in the future"" Weinstein said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cmluZW5nbGlzaC5jb20vbWFsYWdhL21hbGFnYS1jaXR5L2NydWlzZS1zaGlwcy1mZXJpYS0yMDIyMDgxNDA5NDkyNS1udC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three cruise ships with capacity for 9000 passengers make a stopover in Malaga to coincide with the city’s fair,"Three cruise ships with a capacity to accommodate 9000 passengers will dock in the port of Malaga to coincide with the city's Feria celebrations. The first to arrive did so last Friday coinciding with the fireworks that opened the proceedings of the summer fair. It was the Wind Surf a five-masted foremast schooner considered one of the largest cruising sailboats in the world. With a capacity for 312 exclusive passengers the ship docked at the Palmeral de las Sorpresas just a few metres from the bustle of the fair.

The arrival of one of the giants of the cruise sector the Anthem of the Seas with the capacity to carry almost 5000 passengers is scheduled for the 18th. This ship weighing 168666 tonnes and some 347 metres in length will dock from Gibraltar at seven in the morning and will depart at four in the afternoon for Valencia. The Quantum class ship owned by Royal Caribbean International is the second ship in a category that groups large tonnage ships only surpassed by the Meraviglia class of MSC Cruises and the Oasis class of Royal Caribbean International.

A day later the MSC Orchestra will dock at the port sailing from Marseille and will arrive in Malaga at around eight in the morning to leave for Cadiz at seven in the evening. This is the cruise that MSC has based in Malaga this summer season where its passengers embark and disembark in the city. This means that most travellers stay in the destination one more day either before leaving or on their return which will allow them to experience the city’s Feria atmosphere without the classic rush of cruise ship excursions.

According to data from the International Association of Cruise Lines in Spain (CLIA) the average spend per cruise passenger per day in a destination is 341 euros which represents a significant economic impact on the local economy of destinations.

In total forty stopovers are scheduled to arrive at Malaga’s port facilities for the summer season which runs from 15 June to 15 September

From the Port Authority of Malaga they point out that ""although the summer season is not considered one of the high seasons for cruise tourism it should be noted that it consolidates the figures for the same period of 2019. This is not the case for passenger numbers though since the ships still do not carry their maximum capacity although the total reactivation is expected soon”."

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich.

Russians to celebrate WWII victory on Vienna‘s streets. Ukraine asks authorities to ban events.

Hundreds of Russians marched through Vienna to celebrate the victory over Nazi Germany. Ukraine had asked Austria's authorities to ban the anniversary celebrations without success. Some of the participants were highly critical of Europe and Ukraine.

Just like in previous years Ukraine was again unable to obtain a ban on this event in Vienna. According to the Ukrainian embassy this celebration is anti-democratic and a mockery of all Ukrainians who are currently dying in the Russian war in Ukraine.

A Ukrainian protest was held right next to the anniversary celebration. Tetiana Bilyk a Viennese resident from Ukraine said: ‘We must mourn but not celebrate. There is nothing to celebrate.

George Soros’s investment firm bolstered its stakes in Amazon.com Inc. Salesforce Inc. and Alphabet Inc. among other large technology companies. All three rank among its top 10 holdings as of the end of June according to a regulatory filing Friday.

The New York-based firm also added a new $20 million position in Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. though that represents only about 0.4% of Soros’s $4.6 billion US equities portfolio which fell $664 million in the second quarter. Other new additions included $168 million of Alleghany Corp. stock and $201.5 million in shares of American Campus which Blackstone Inc. agreed to buy in April.

Tech stocks have surged since entering a bear market earlier this year with the Nasdaq 100 up more than 20% from its low set in mid-June. US stocks advanced for the fourth-straight week the longest streak of weekly gains since November.

The billionaire philanthropist’s investment firm managed more than $28 billion as of the start of 2022 including public and private equity. Soros 92 has used his fortune to fund groups promoting justice democracy human rights and progressive politics through his Open Society Foundations.

He’s poured billions into his philanthropic efforts and most of his firm’s assets now belong to the foundations rather than the Soros family. His personal wealth is estimated at $8.5 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Money managers overseeing more than $100 million in US equities have to file a 13F form within 45 days of the end of each quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges. It’s one of the few places to gain insight into how hedge funds and some large family offices invest.

At the time of writing Apple Microsoft Alphabet and Amazon are the only four U.S. companies with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or greater. Tesla is not far behind with a market cap of $907 million.

These are elite businesses that have earned shareholders tremendous gains. It goes without saying that these companies all had much smaller market caps not too long ago. Amazon's market cap was $105 billion exactly 10 years ago.

Generally a good place to look for the next home-run stocks are growing companies with a market cap between $100 billion to $500 billion. But in this case let's first look at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) which has a higher market cap but could be a timely buy right now.

For higher return prospects you'll want to consider Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.31%) and Salesforce (CRM 0.55%). These are solid growth stories that still have years to play out.

1. Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway is one of the safest stocks you can hold for the long term. After rising 50% over the last five years it carries a market cap of $653 billion. That puts it within shooting distance of the $1 trillion milestone. There are a few reasons Berkshire will keep growing in value.

Berkshire has a sterling balance sheet with $122 billion of cash and fixed securities. The company has a large stock portfolio worth $327 billion at the end of the second quarter. Buffett's investment vehicle holds large stakes in Apple Bank of America and Coca-Cola among other stocks. Buffett has most recently been adding to large stakes in Chevron Occidental Petroleum and leading PC brand HP (formerly Hewlett-Packard).

Another piece of Berkshire's intrinsic value is its dozens of privately held businesses. The company's subsidiaries span everything from candy to railroads. It also owns several insurance companies that provide $147 billion in float or money that Berkshire collects from insurance premiums that it can reinvest in stocks bonds or acquisitions. Many of these Berkshire-held businesses tend to be immune from the changes in technology which adds a degree of predictability to their long-term performance -- something Buffett no doubt considered.

One of Buffett's best stock ideas lately has been Berkshire Hathaway itself. Through the first half of 2022 he bought $4 billion worth of the company's shares -- a sign that Buffett sees the stock as undervalued. The stock's price has tripled over the last decade and could repeat that return which would push Berkshire's market cap over $1 trillion by 2032.

2. Advanced Micro Devices

Owning companies that serve megatrends in technology such as spending on data centers cloud computing and other advanced computing needs could pay off big. Advanced Micro Devices has emerged as a key supplier of high-performance chips in these markets.

AMD currently sports a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23 based on 2022 earnings estimates and has a market cap of $159 billion. To reach $1 trillion in 10 years the share price needs to climb at a compound annual rate of 20%. That is achievable for this fast-growing chipmaker.

For a long time AMD was the underdog in the semiconductor industry. It's always played the role of a low-cost alternative to leaders like Intel and Nvidia but not anymore.

While AMD is still way behind Intel in central processing units (CPUs) and Nvidia in graphics processing units (GPUs) it is winning over customers with its renewed focus on designing high-performance chips. Data center operators are now looking at AMD's Epyc server chips as a viable alternative to Intel. In the last quarter AMD again gained market share over its CPU rival. Revenue grew 70% year over year in the second quarter driven by strong growth in data center chips and consumer chips for notebooks and gaming.

The data center accelerator market which includes spending on CPUs and GPUs is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 34% through 2027 reaching $75 billion. AMD just completed the acquisition of Xilinx a leading supplier of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips which fills out its product lineup to tackle this enormous opportunity. The strong tailwind in the data center market along with AMD's modest valuation could deliver market-beating returns to investors over the long term.

There is a reason why AMD CEO Lisa Su is considered one of the top business leaders right now. Su has done a marvelous job guiding this underdog to industry leadership and its best days are still ahead.

3. Salesforce

The name Salesforce doesn't sound like a growth tech stock that is worthy of the elite club of $1 trillion companies but every investor should know about this amazing business.

Former Oracle executive Marc Benioff co-founded Salesforce in 1999 and currently serves as the company's chairman and co-CEO. Salesforce pioneered the software-as-a-service business model. Companies save money by subscribing to Salesforce's cloud-based software which lowers in-house expenses by maintaining installing and keeping systems updated.

Salesforce has grown tremendously and has been ranked the No. 1 customer relationship management (CRM) software provider for nine years. Its flagship product is the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Customer 360 platform which offers a suite of software that helps companies manage sales marketing and e-commerce and it continues to expand into new categories.

It has reinvested its growing profitability into strategic acquisitions that expand its offering and competitive lead in the market. Last year it acquired Slack Technologies which offers a communication platform for employees for $27 billion.

What's most remarkable about Salesforce is its consistency which speaks volumes about the size of its long-term growth opportunity. After two decades of high revenue growth Salesforce is still growing quarterly revenue over 20% year over year.

It generated $27 billion in revenue over the last four quarters but the total addressable market for the company's services is expected to reach $284 billion by 2026 according to Gartner Research. It can grow for a long time. However if Salesforce continues its record of strategic acquisitions its addressable market could widen even more as it expands its product offering.

With a market cap of $189 billion Salesforce is well on its way toward $1 trillion. It has the industry leadership and massive market opportunity to deliver market-beating returns to investors.

Now is the perfect time to buy shares. At a price-to-sales ratio of 6.8 the stock is near its cheapest valuation in the last 10 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2RhdmlkLWhvZ2FuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MjEzODky0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Hogan Obituary - Wilhelm's Portland Memorial Funeral & Cremation - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/david-hogan-obituary?id=36213892 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2RhdmlkLWhvZ2FuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MjEzODky0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9sZWdlbmRhcnktZmluYW5jaWVyLWdlb3JnZS1zb3Jvcy1iZXRzLWJpZy1vbi1hbWF6b24tYW5kLWFscGhhYmV00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Legendary Financier George Soros Bets Big on Amazon and Alphabet,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/legendary-financier-george-soros-bets-big-on-amazon-and-alphabet on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9sZWdlbmRhcnktZmluYW5jaWVyLWdlb3JnZS1zb3Jvcy1iZXRzLWJpZy1vbi1hbWF6b24tYW5kLWFscGhhYmV00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

It is known that India and Myanmar have both explored for gas and oil reserves in their respective sea areas adjacent to Bangladesh maritime borders. Experts believe that as both the neighboring countries went ahead in exploring for underground fuels and subsequently been extracting oil and gas there are strong potentials in finding similar reserves in the Bay as well.

To meet the domestic demand Bangladesh is importing costly LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) from the international market. Its own gas reserves are also declining. If the country finds a sufficient amount of oil and gas reserves in the Bay it can help overcome the current crisis and save a huge amount of money expert said.

Sources said that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly pushed for offshore oil and gas exploration but due to bureaucratic complications results are not satisfactory.

The price of oil and gas in the world market is increasing day by day. Even with rationing-load-shedding it has become difficult to manage the power situation in the country. LNG has to be imported at a much higher price to meet the shortfall. Because the demand for gas is increasing; But the production in the country is decreasing.

The current government undertook a survey of the sea eight years ago. However the programme has not started as of now. A contract with a foreign company was signed in 2020 after five years. Two years have passed but no significant survey work was done in the Bay.

Due to poor response to international tenders for oil and gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal the government decided to conduct a multi-client survey of the entire maritime area to get an accurate idea of the total fuel reserve in the Bay energy division officials said.

In 2015 Petrobangla invited international tenders for this survey. Five companies had submitted their proposals. TGS- Schlumberger Consortium were selected as eligible in the tender evaluation.

Petrobangla then finalized the proposal and sent it to the Energy Division to seek the approval of the Cabinet Committee for the contract. But the process was abruptly canceled and Petrobangla was instructed by the Energy Division to call for tenders again. There are allegations that the decision could not be taken due to pressure from a beneficiary group as their chosen company could not get the job.

Later when the tender was called again five proposals were submitted. The TGS-Schlumberger consortium was in first position again in the bidding process. The proposal for the agreement was then sent to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs held on 3 August 2016 through the Energy Division.

Relevant sources said that it was also opposed that the tender process for the service was not correct. Later a five-member committee headed by Law Minister Anisul Haq was formed to verify the validity of the tender evaluation. About nine months later a report from the Law Ministry was sent to the Cabinet Committee.

The proposal also remained unmoved for a long time. It was finally approved by the Cabinet Committee in April 2019. In March 2020 Petrobangla signed a final agreement with TGS and the Schlumberger Consortium.

As part of the first phase the consortium will conduct a 13600 line kilometer 2-D Multi-Client seismic survey at sea. Although the activities were supposed to start in February they have not been able to arrange any investors due to Model PSC of Bangladesh 2019.

To this end an initiative was taken to revise the Model PSC in 2020. But due to the negligence of a director of Petrobangla these activities remained on file for about one and a half years. Later with the intervention of the higher authorities an international consulting firm was appointed for this work through a tender at the end of last year. The agency has not yet submitted its report.

Badrul Imam Honorary Professor of Department of Geology of University of Dhaka told Bangladesh Post “The multi-client survey was supposed to start in 2015. However it is not started yet which is bad luck for us.”

“Foreign companies are not interested in oil and gas exploration in the sea without adequate data. Multi-client seismic survey is a recognized method for this. Through which a preliminary idea of the geological structure and location of mineral resources at the bottom of the sea is obtained. The data from this survey will make companies interested in participating in oil and gas exploration there” he added.

Badrul Imam said that due to the survey data India and Myanmar have been able to attract foreign companies to explore oil and gas at their ends. Bangladesh has lagged far behind due to not being able to conduct multi-client surveys.

In March 2012 and July 2014 in historic victories at the UN Maritime Tribunal Bangladesh got 111000 square kilometers and 19467 square kilometers from Myanmar and India respectively.

After settling the dispute with Bangladesh India and Myanmar have started extracting huge quantities of gas in their parts of the sea. Myanmar is exploring and drilling gas blocks. In 2016 Myanmar announced a gas production of 4 trillion cubic feet in Block Thalin-1. The gas lifting started from here.

Currently more than 10 foreign companies are working for exploration in a number of blocks in the sea of the Myanmar area.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Seagate Expasion with the 24-inch iMac

Seagate Expansion 8TB external hard drive 3.0 / 5

When speed isn't paramount external USB hard drives are necessary tools for any Mac owner. The Seagate Expansion is a solid choice with 8TB of capacity for backups and file storage.

Seagate is well known in the storage space building not only the internal drives but enclosures as well. Most drives in the Seagate lineup are mass-market consumer devices while LaCie represents Seagate's professional line.

While they aren't necessarily as flashy as LaCie Seagate devices are reliable and more widely available.

Design and connectivity

The Seagate Expansion is your typical desktop storage solution. It has a well-vented plastic body just a hair larger than the 3.5-inch hard drive it hides within.

Rear ports on the Seagate Expansion

It connects to your Mac or PC using USB 3.1. On the rear of the drive is a common barrel connector used for the included power supply and USB Micro-B port.

We aren't huge fans of the slim Micro-B connector but they get used frequently with external hard drives. As the cable is a USB-A cable you may need to use a hub or adapter with your Mac if solely has USB-C ports.

The included USB-A cable and our replacement USB-C

In our case we just picked up one of the widely-available USB-C to Micro-B cables found on Amazon. We'd prefer a USB-C cable in the box but plenty of people still rely on USB-A and replacement cables are easy to come by in a pinch.

Using the Seagate Expansion with our MacBook Air

The enclosure has a striped appearance with angled lines along the plastic body. The top rear and bottom have hidden vents that allow airflow to the hard drive. They're in between the lines that make them near-invisible at a glance.

Because of the passive cooling the drive feels a little hollow when we pick it up but that's preferable to a loud spinning fan.

Finally silicone feet are on the underside of the drive that keep it just off the surface of your desk and prevent it from sliding around.

Speed and performance

Speed isn't going to impress anyone on the Seagate Expansion drive. Not because it is bad but because it is aiming to be affordable.

Spinning hard drive platters are going to be cheaper than solid state media especially when you're looking for something as large as 8TB.

If you need a backup system or a place to store a wealth of files then this is what you need.

We hooked the drive up to our Mac and the drive was formatted in ExFat by default. As ExFat it can work with both Mac or Windows PCs out of the box but you can easily reformat it into the more Apple-specific APFS or leave it in ExFat for universal access.

Blackmagic Disk Speed Test results

Using the Blackmagic Disk Speed test we got 177MB/s for our write speed and 178MB/s for the read speed. This isn't fast but not terribly slow either.

In practical terms we transferred a 1GB file to the Seagate Expansion in under 10 seconds. Again for a backup drive file repository and everyday tasks this will be just fine.

Using the Seagate Expansion with our MacBook Air

This won't be ideal for a video editing scratch drive but it's great in 95 percent of other use cases. Not everyone is moving 124GB Final Cut libraries with any regularity.

Should you buy the Seagate Expansion external hard drive?

There's not always a need for the flashiest hardware. Seagate has a solid drive with an attractive appearance that provides you with 8TB of reliable storage at an affordable price.

Seagate Expansion in its box

You can get faster drives that have hard drives in a raid formation or that use SSD but they'll cost you notably more. If you have no need for additional speed the Seagate Expansion will get the job done without breaking the bank.

Seagate Expansion pros

Solid reliable drive

Ample 8TB capacity

Sleek modern exterior

Affordable

Preformatted in the universal ExFat file system

Seagate Expansion cons

No USB-C cable incldued

Uses full-size desktop drive that take up more space

HDD speeds

But the tech executive didn't always run companies based in Silicon Valley. Between 2014 and 2019 he served as CEO of SAP (SAP) a global software giant based in Walldorf Germany.

In a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Finance’s editor-in-chief Andy Serwer the CEO highlighted the biggest difference between running an U.S. company and a European one — companies in the U.S. in his view operate more efficiently.

“I think the big thing is speed. And to me the greatest asset in business is speed” McDermott told Yahoo Finance. Specifically he said “On a day-to-day basis it's just faster to operate in the U.S.""

'More of a challenging structure'

McDermott explained that European companies are often less efficient because they must balance both employee representative interests and board members’ interests.

European countries tend to have more union representation than the United States. For instance in the United States roughly 10 percent of workers have unionized as of 2021. Meanwhile the most recent data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED) places union membership in Germany at roughly 16%. In the rest of Europe the rates can get as high as 26% in Ireland and a staggering 92% in Iceland.

“It is a little bit more of a challenging structure. When employees and external board members participate equally in the management of senior management there is more protocol there are more channels that have to be operated through to get stuff done” McDermott says.

Yet employee representatives can also serve a key role in protecting workers. For instance unionized workers earn on average 11.2% more in wages than non-unionized peers according to the Economic Policy Institute. While McDermott asserts that American companies are more efficient he concedes that speed can come at the expense of workers.

“So I just think we move a little quicker. That's not always good by the way sometimes more checks and balances [are] very positive” McDermott said. “And I think employee representatives play a very important part in European companies if management and the employees are on the same page.”

Though the U.S. has fewer unionized employees than Europe the country has recently experienced a resurgence of unions. For instance unions are forming at major companies including Apple Starbucks Trader Joe's and REI. Nearly 70% of Americans approve of labor unions according to a Gallup poll from 2021.

Story continues

Despite any challenges McDermott might have faced SAP grew under his leadership. As CEO of SAP — which has 107415 total employees and offices in 180 countries — McDermott guided the company from $39 billion to $163 billion in market cap TechCrunch reported in 2019 the year he joined ServiceNow.

According to anonymous sources cited by Reuters in a report published Friday (Aug. 12) the company has been running out of cash. One source added that Hash was looking into raising capital with SoftBank Group’s Latin America fund though nothing came of that.

Hash lets B2B companies provide financial payments and banking solutions for merchants. Since it was founded in 2017 the company has raised $60 million through three funding rounds. In its latest funding round in October 2021 the FinTech raised $40 million per the report.

As the economy has been seeing turbulence with supply chain issues and inflation disrupting operations many companies have had to downsize and make changes. For instance Peloton recently cut roughly 800 jobs to help the company improve its future business outlook.

According to CEO Barry McCarthy the idea was “to make Peloton more efficient cost effective innovative and to best position ourselves for the future.”

Peloton will also be outsourcing more of its customer service operations which McCarthy said was essential to help Peloton become cash-flow positive. He added “Cash is oxygen. Oxygen is life. We simply must become self-sustaining on a cash flow basis.”

In addition brokerage app Robinhood cut around 23% of its staff earlier this month with PYMNTS writing that customers’ slower trading had contributed to the issues.

Robinhood had already laid off around 9% of its staff in April. The combined cuts have added up to about 1000 people gone from the company.

In its second quarter report this year Robinhood reported a 34% drop in active users since the same time last year. CEO Vlad Tenev said there’s a broader reorganization happening and that the April layoffs had not been enough to help the costs for the company.

Instacart filed paperwork to go public earlier this year and while there was no timeline for it to happen The Wall Street Journal recently said the third-party delivery app was looking for its initial public offering to occur before the end of the year.

While there are headwinds to face in going public Instacart was reportedly profitable in the second quarter on a GAAP basis something most third-party delivery stocks have found difficult to do on a regular basis. Yet its peers have not lived up to their pre-public debut hype and there are doubts about Instacart's own valuation.

Although Instacart was once the market leader in grocery delivery by far let's see whether it can still deliver the goods for investors if it goes public or if you should steer clear of a potential car wreck.

Market devaluation

This is a difficult market to go public in. Data from FactSet says there was $317 billion raised by 1073 companies IPOing in the first half of 2021 but only 92 companies have IPO'd over the first six months this year raising just under $9 billion.

Instacart itself is having difficulty coming up with a valuation that could be satisfactory to the market with Bloomberg reporting the delivery service slashed its own estimates this past May from $39 billion to $24 billion -- a 38% drop but not enough to please its investors.

Capital Group went even further and cut its valuation of the delivery app to just $14.7 billion or $45.84 per share down from $119.96 per share in March. Fidelity Investments cut its valuation to $48.43 per share at the end of May a 25% devaluation from its $64.85 per share price applied just a month earlier.

T. Rowe Price Group another investor still has a $96 per share valuation that it set in March. These investor groups bought shares in Instacart through private placements over the past few years.

Slowing growth

Instacart isn't alone in getting thrashed by the market. Uber Technologies (UBER -1.38%) is down 26% so far in 2022 while DoorDash (DASH -1.15%) has seen its stock cut in half. And JustEatTakeaway.com (TKAY.F 0.91%) which owns Grubhub has lost nearly three-quarters of its value this year.

It's because grocery delivery growth is slowing. Market researchers at Brick Meets Click e-grocery dropped about 13% from the first tto second quarter this year.

While inflation higher energy costs and rising interest rates are taking a toll on consumers delivery actually represents a somewhat larger percentage of the total sales because retailers are providing more ways to receive their orders. It's a problem for services like Instacart as the field is a crowded one.

That helps explain why its growth has slowed after the boom of the early pandemic era. According to Bloomberg's Second Measure Instacart's year-over-year sales growth has steadily declined every single quarter since the first quarter of 2021 as average sales per customer have fallen even though they remain above pre-pandemic levels.

No room to move

It's hard to recommend the Instacart IPO. The IPO market is not favorable right now so there will be a lot of money left on the table and because even its internal valuations are so elusive it's possible investors will be burned right out of the gate.

Because grocery delivery growth is so anemic Instacart (and its rivals) have had to resort to branching out into other areas such as launching Instacart Platform to give retailers a suite of tools and services. It also delved deeper into advertising allowing other consumer product brands to market their products but at a time when advertisers are reining in their spending.

Instacart has also launched a line of clothing and accessories as if someone would want to be a walking billboard for a food delivery app.

While anything can change by the time Instacart finally lists its shares an IPO for the food delivery stock right now looks like one that investors should avoid at all costs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2ZvcmJlcy1nbG9iYWwtcHJvcGVydGllcy8yMDIyLzA4LzE0L2hvdy1icmFuZGVkLXJlc2lkZW5jZXMtYXJlLWNyZWF0aW5nLW5ldy1zdGFuZGFyZHMtZm9yLWx1eHVyeS1saXZpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Branded Residences Are Creating New Standards For Luxury Living,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-global-properties/2022/08/14/how-branded-residences-are-creating-new-standards-for-luxury-living/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2ZvcmJlcy1nbG9iYWwtcHJvcGVydGllcy8yMDIyLzA4LzE0L2hvdy1icmFuZGVkLXJlc2lkZW5jZXMtYXJlLWNyZWF0aW5nLW5ldy1zdGFuZGFyZHMtZm9yLWx1eHVyeS1saXZpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoYXdsb2NhbC5jb20vc2F1ay12YWxsZXkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4LzE0L3Byb3BlcnR5LXRyYW5zZmVycy1mb3Itd2hpdGVzaWRlLWxlZS1hbmQtb2dsZS1jb3VudGllcy1maWxlZC1hdWctMS01L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Property transfers for Whiteside Lee and Ogle counties filed Aug. 1-5,"Whiteside County

Where Do You Buy Your Tools?!

In past articles we’ve learned that there is no shame in buying tools from Harbor Freight and that in fact it makes sense in many cases to choose a tool from “Heart Break” ---one of the more strained monikers I’ve heard---over many other name brand tools that promise quality at a price.

Other nicknames for the HF brand include:

• Harbor Hate

• Harbor Fright

• Bottom of the Harbor Freight

• China Fright

• The Chinese Cheesecake Factory

But is this fair and accurate? Weeeeeeeeeell nobody would deny that there is an element of risk and even perhaps danger with SOME HF products---and I have one near eye fatality photo to prove it---but like in all things you have to be smart when you buy anything by doing your research apply a little common sense…and wear proper safety equipment whenever in the garage. DOH!

Case in point: online you will find some items that are no brainers when it comes to “Things to Never Buy from Harbor Freight” such as:

• Bullet proof vests

• Parachutes

• Elevators

• Birth control devices

• Fire Extinguishers

• Pacemakers

• Vaccines

But seriously the general advice that the more components in a tool the more likely it will fail on you is a good yardstick to measure by when making a shopping decision at Harbor Freight.

Enough with the Hate Already!

What prompted this article topic was a Rainman Ray’s Repairs YouTube channel episode today where Ray responds to a comment made by one viewer that is an example of misguided notions when it comes to mechanics and where they buy their tools.

In other words a little online Harbor Freight tool shaming that if the source of the comment had taken the time to actually look inside the tool cabinets of most mechanics he or she would very likely discover that only in advertisements will you see a single brand tool in a mechanic’s garage.

Here’s the video that makes the point quite aptly:

On Sunday the Oscar-winning actress made 56 look like the new 36 when she posted a thank you message and photo to all of the birthday well-wishers which included a number of her celebrity friends and her beau Van Hunt.

She confessed to be 'feeling so much gratitude and love on this birthday!' in the caption which she punctuated with a 'WOW!' at the end.

The 12 - our free newsletter with all the news you need

The Beckhams have a knack for looking effortlessly cool. Most of them could wear anything and still pull it off. But Cruz Beckham has really taken that to a new extreme this week after wearing a t-shirt with his mum's face on it and somehow still managing to not look uncool.

The 17-year-old second youngest child of David and Victoria appeared in a ""gorgeous"" family snap on Friday (August 12) wearing an old school Spice Girls t-shirt. Posing alongside David 47 Victoria 48 his big brother Romeo 19 and his little sister Harper 11 Cruz paired the tee with a denim jacket brown cords and some bling to top it off.

Victoria and Cruz both shared the family photo on their Instagram pages and hilariously fans couldn't get enough of Cruz's get-up. ""I want my son to wear a t-shirt with me on it! Life goals!!"" one fellow mum told Victoria in the comments as another one agreed: ""I was just thinking that!""

""Cruz in that T-Shirt though"" gushed one person and another added: ""Ugh the Spice Girls shirt so true [heart face heart eye face emoji]."" A third person told the Beckhams: ""You guys are… GOALs"" while a fourth agreed they looked like a ""gorgeous family"" adding: ""Love how close you all are.""

Cruz's Instagram post of the same photo was similarly flooded with gushing fans with one writing ""It's Cruz wearing a Spice Girls shirt for me!!"" and another adding: ""Cruz's Spice Girl shirt is everything."" One fan said they were ""Living for Cruz in the Spice Girls shirt!""

Cruz is the second youngest of the Beckham brood and according to The Sun he is keen to follow in the footsteps of his mum and pursue a music career. When Cruz was two he did a Spice Girls break dance routine for fans at a reunion tour at Madison Square Garden and in 2016 he released a Christmas single If Every Day Was Christmas with proceeds going to charity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvMTY1NTA4NC92aWN0b3JpYS1iZWNraGFtLWRhdmlkLWJlY2toYW0taG90LWluc3RhZ3JhbS1waWN0dXJlcy1sYXRlc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Victoria Beckham shares 'hot' snap of husband David before massage,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvMTY1NTA4NC92aWN0b3JpYS1iZWNraGFtLWRhdmlkLWJlY2toYW0taG90LWluc3RhZ3JhbS1waWN0dXJlcy1sYXRlc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

What are some of the best things to do in the fall in Southern California?

There are so many incredible things to do during the fall months in Southern California. One of our favorite activities is to go leaf-peeping and there are beautiful lakeside and mountain destinations around this area of the state that are absolutely perfect! One destination that we highly recommend is Green Valley Lake. Located in the San Bernardino Mountains this area becomes absolutely stunning during the fall season. You can enjoy a long day trip or even a weekend getaway to this lake for the ultimate fall retreat.

Wrightwood is another destination that absolutely comes alive during the fall months in Southern California. When the fall foliage is at its peak this entire town is surrounded by the most vibrant colors and it is breathtakingly beautiful. When visiting give yourself plenty of time to roam the streets and visit the many shops and eateries along the way.

Of course many of the state parks in Southern California transform during the autumn and you’ll enjoy the most vibrant red yellow and orange leaves. During your visit to these state parks you can hike fish and boat. You may even want to camp and disconnect for a few days.

Are there any road trips I should take during the fall in Southern California?

Yes! There are so many different trip options that you’ll never want to stay at home. One road trip that we highly recommend is a simple two-hour drive that takes you from Wrightwood to Big Bear Lake. This is one of our favorite drives for viewing fall foliage and you’ll also drive through charming historic towns in Southern California as well. It’s the perfect fall day adventure!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1lcGFya2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ZsdW1lLzIwMjIwOC85MDkxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Long-Closed California Park Has Returned,"A Long-Closed California Park Has Returned

Wild Rivers first opened in Irvine Calif. in 1986 replacing a drive-through safari on land owned by the Irvine Company in a bid to join an ever-competitive Southern California water park landscape. That lasted a remarkably long in hindsight 25 years given the value of the soil it sat on. The old Wild Rivers now has been replaced by the Los Olivos apartments near a just-okay outdoor shopping mall. (It is not the nice mall in the area.)

Today Wild Rivers is back - on land owned by the City of Irvine on the site of the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. That base was home to many of the aircraft that ah saw action in World War II. That history has inspired the South Pacific theme at Wild Rivers; whether the South Pacific remembers that action as fondly as the big ole planes that landed at El Toro we might never know.

To hear Wild Rivers’ legacy builders (and a handful of adults I talked to while exploring the park on Friday) the loss of the park in 2011 left a 20-something-acre-sized hole in their hearts. The kids letting loose unholy screams every time the wave pool kicked into high gear seemed less concerned about the past and more interested in the present.

So the present. Wild Rivers opened mid-summer after breaking ground in late 2021. The park opened without its full accoutrement of rides (a soft opening in theme park parlance) but that did not I assure you come with a break on ticket prices. Those run $65 for adults and $40 for kids under 48” — but more on that later.

The park can just about consider itself fully open as of early August having cut the ribbon on its straggler slides in late July. Some credit can be given to the park for its transparency: There is a section on its website for ride availability that is (in my opinion) easy to find. How much of a balm was that for guests in the first month of operation? I don’t know.

Pacific Grille which also did not open with the park also has come on line. So Wild Rivers now has a pair of quick-service grab-and-go-style eateries that are now open. Operations at Pacific Grille where I ate lunch with my group were running okay (chicken fingers were hard to come by) and the food was fine. The prices are reasonable by theme park standards and I did not have to wait in any lines.

The park also has a full-service bar located between the lazy river and the wave pool (Mustang Grill). One member of my group tried a Bloody Mary which cost $9 — that may have been the stunner of the trip. I did not inquire about other prices which in hindsight I regret.

Seating and shade were both at a premium throughout my visit and that was most apparent directly after grabbing lunch. We ate at 1:30pm which was not late enough to miss “the rush” of hungry families wandering around looking for a spot to sit. Some of the problems are inevitable water park hassles: People abandon their belongings on tables and chairs all day leaving nowhere for people to actually sit. Of course some of these problems belong to Wild Rivers. There were virtually no benches and no shade structures anywhere around the park.

But the slides? They are spectacular. Wild Rivers built four six-person raft attractions with increased capacity in mind and I’m happy to report that the lines move accordingly. Those slides - Aquaconda Bora Bora Boomerango Tortuga and Typhoon - ranked among my group-of-four’s favorites. We waited no more than 30 minutes for each attraction some less than that — I recommend Boomerango and Typhoon.

Of course the crown jewel of the park is its water coaster — and everyone knows it. Pelican Plunge is 558 long 41 feet tall and it is magnificent.

I waited 60 minutes on the nose — most of which was spent at the bottom of the hill waiting to grab an intertube from a rider. That’s a system that needs tightening up. Let’s just say waterparks and line jumpers make for pretty good bedfellows and the lifeguards and ride operators were not always up to the task of policing bad behavior.

Among other highlights: The park boasts a 1700-foot lazy river (which ranks among the longest in California — though Knott’s Berry Farm’s Soak City has them covered by 80 feet) and a 25000-square foot wave pool. Director of Guest Experience Eric Gieszl estimated the pool holds around 450000 gallons of water which puts it on the small side compared to its Southern Californian brethren (Knott’s is 750000 gallons Raging Waters is 1000000) — though that discrepancy likely has more to do with the depth of the pool than the area.

There are also five tube slides the highlight of which is Tiki’s Revenge (we only waited 30 minutes — the wait can stretch longer depending on the time of day) and four body slides.

That includes the popular racer-style mat slides Tomcat Racers. Wild Rivers also boasts a sizable kids area which will be expanded in 2023 when Kontiki Cove is completed.

I walked past a changing room near the wave pool that is not quite open yet and a handful of bottle filling stations were also not functioning. The dessert/ice cream shop also was not open on my visit though Gieszl said that opening was coming soon.

Speaking of changing rooms: In what may be a more evolutionary than revolutionary change they are kept separate from the bathrooms and instead in banks near the locker area at the front of the park. This seemed like a welcome change (and generally speaking removed one of the Things People Hate About Water Parks right off the bat). The lockers were also convenient and easy to use — a large locker costs $23 a medium $18. While we’re at it parking is $25 when you purchase at the park. It’s $20 if you buy it online.

Perhaps the most obvious sign that the park’s primary goal was “get open for 2022” is the landscaping. There isn’t much of it.

I’ve seen more barren themed areas before (see: my review of Wonder Woman: Flight of Courage) but most of the planted trees are young or palms and the site (and smell) of dirt and mulch is prevalent. Your view on the back half of the lazy river reminded me of an under construction housing development... oh shoot.

Wild Rivers is not the first the only or the worst offender of the “we gotta get this sucker open and start making money” phenomenon. This is capitalism baby. But a $65 ticket for an adult (and frankly for most kids) is on the high side in the Southern California market. Knott’s Soak City charges between $50-57 Hurricane Harbor between $55-60 and you can get into Raging Waters for $45. They’re not demanding Volcano Bay money ($80) but does Wild Rivers offer the best water park experience in Southern California?

It certainly has that potential. While it is an unfinished park in current form it already boasts a wonderful collection of attractions in a convenient location for those in the South Orange County region. My advice: Rope drop Pelican’s Plunge. You won’t regret it.

Rather than being assigned a seat at check-in passengers can select any available seat upon boarding the airplane. But Southwest boards passengers in strict boarding group order so you either want to pay extra to get an early boarding group or check-in before anyone else.

Getting onboard the airplane before anyone else obviously gives you access to the cream of the crop seats but there’s no guarantee that someone else isn’t going to ruin your day by sitting next to you when other passengers have a spare seat next to them.

And that conundrum has resulted in a number of different viral hacks being developed.

A Southwest passenger has recently shown off his simple hack to avoid losing the open seating lottery by making it look like someone is already occupying the middle seat beside him.

Zach Prengler shared a video on TikTok in which other passengers bypass the middle seat next to him because they mistakenly think a person is already sitting in the seat.

Not so however. In fact the ‘ghost person’ is actually just Zach’s arm pushed into a hoodie with a baseball cap on top. It’s a remarkably simple trick but Zach says it actually worked.

Many people commentating on his video applauded Zach for his ‘ingenious’ hack but one person cautioned that it could cause an incorrect passenger count and lead to delays.

Others pointed out that the hack is only going to work when the flight isn’t full.

Last month another Southwest passenger shared his own seating hack which involves gently patting the empty seat next to them while staring at passengers passing down the aisle.

Strangely enough the tactic unnerved other passengers who quickly kept on walking to find another empty seat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vMjAtYmlnZ2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQtc291dGh3ZXN0LWFtZXJpY2FuLWRlbHRhLTIwMjItONIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vMjAtYmlnZ2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQtc291dGh3ZXN0LWFtZXJpY2FuLWRlbHRhLTIwMjItOD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20 biggest airlines in the world; Southwest American Delta,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnM4LmNvbS92aWRlby9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL292ZXItMTAwLXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGlnaHRzLWRlbGF5ZWQtYXQtc2FuLWRpZWdvLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYWlycG9ydC81MDktYWVmYTJhNGUtNGJkMS00MGI5LWI3NjMtNDJhODQ1MzA5ZGRk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Over 100 Southwest Airlines flights delayed at San Diego International airport,"Next up in 5

The café at the corner of Astor Place and Lafayette Street regularly contends with drug users mentally disturbed people and homeless folks looking to take a nap The Post witnessed.

“Starbucks got too woke too fast” said java joint regular Konstantin Dobryakov. “Now some customers are too scared to go in because you’ve got a bunch of homeless people sleeping in there. They got to be ready to kick people out and not give everyone a free cup of coffee. You give them a finger and they’ll take a hand.”

This past week The Post saw homeless people nodding off washing their hair in a public sink and being transported to the hospital from the recently unionized Starbucks. Among the eye-openers:

5 Customers have complained about the storefront’s rank smell and crowded seats. Stefano Giovannini

One man brought in his own box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch a carton of milk and some Entenmann’s mini crumb cakes before passing out face down on a table. Afterward he rolled spliffs as nearby paying customers tried to enjoy their lattes and Frappuccinos.

A mentally disturbed man in a black trench coat talked to himself and screamed obscenities at the communal mirror near the bathrooms for 30 minutes. “There’s a guy over by the bathrooms making people really uncomfortable” one customer told an employee behind the counter. Two police officers one of whom carrying a riot shield eventually removed him without incident.

There’s also the foul odor and garbage build up at the location — newspapers food wrappers and empty coffee cups litter the indoor patio. “Nothing like the smell of BO and urine with your morning coffee” a Nextdoor user commented in response to a photo that showed snoozing squatters lying in a booth surrounded by trash tote bags and luggage.

On Friday EMTs were called to assist a man who had passed out on the steps blocking an exit. He regained consciousness and entered the ambulance with the help of the paramedics.

Once Manhattan’s largest Starbucks — now outsized by the 23000 square foot Starbucks Reserve and Roastery in Chelsea — the Astor Place location is a go-to spot for the destitute said Dave a 28-year-old homeless man from Boston.

“They’ve got phone chargers and nice couches” he said. “Ever since those black guys were arrested at one in Philadelphia a few years ago nobody really wants to touch you. Employees might come over and very quietly ask sleeping people to wake up and move on but then those same guys go right back to sleep. The cops will only show up if someone is dangerous.”

Critics say it’s Starbucks’ own fault its shops have been commandeered by derelicts drunks and dope pushers after they made their bathrooms public and even put syringe disposal boxes in some of them.

“They allow anybody to use their restrooms which sounds like a good idea but when you’ve got a country that uses public space as homeless shelters and mental health wards that assures having people shooting up heroin in the bathrooms and halfway moving into them” said Kevin Williamson a political commentator.

The java giant has taken some major blows this summer.

Starbucks recently announced it would shutter 16 profitable stores two of which are unionized across Seattle; Los Angeles; Philadelphia; Washington DC and Portland Oregon due to safety concerns violent crime and rampant drug use in and around the shops.

“It has shocked me that one of the primary concerns that our retail partners have is their own personal safety. And then we heard the stories that go along with it about what happens in our bathrooms” CEO Howard Schultz said during an internal meeting that was first reported by the Post Millennial in July. “We are facing things in which the stores were not built for. So we’re listening to our people and closing stores. This is just the beginning. There are going to be many more.”

A Starbucks spokesperson said individual locations have the authority to change hours or go “drive-thru only” as a way to “do what they need to create a safe environment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdW5pY29ybnJpb3QubmluamEvMjAyMi9yZWNlbnRseS11bmlvbml6ZWQtbWlubmVhcG9saXMtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXdvcmtlcnMtY29uZHVjdC10d28tZGF5LXN0cmlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recently Unionized Minneapolis Starbucks Workers Conduct Two-day Strike - UNICORN RIOT,"Minneapolis MN – The corner of 47th Street and Cedar Avenue in Minneapolis was quiet for the first time after spirited drumming and chants of “What’s disgusting? Union busting!” filled the air from July 31-August 1. Employees of the Cedar Avenue Starbucks had returned to work after a two-day strike in protest of the company’s refusal to bargain with the newly formed union as well as what the workers say are backhanded attempts to undermine union efforts.

Baristas and shift supervisors united to raise grievances against the manager of the location and Starbucks corporate for difficult working conditions and low pay. In a letter posted on the front door of the store workers addressed their manager:

“Direction only from the top is an unjust system we refuse to participate in. You are complicit in that system. Perhaps you see yourself as a better manager than others for doing the bare minimum of legally required actions to aid our union but we aren’t unionized to ask for the bare minimum. We unionize because we demand a living not survival. We demand a genuine and honest discussion between corporate and union representatives and we demand a better store environment NOW.” Letter from Starbucks’ workers

Below are pictures of the ‘Strike Notice’ that was posted on the front door of the Minneapolis Starbucks by the unionized workers.

Understaffing and inconsistent scheduling practices have been a recurring issue at the store according to workers though they say it has escalated in recent months. Kasey Copeland a Starbucks barista and trainer of three years said:

“Generally when we’re really busy we have two to three partners on the bar. There have been several days that someone has been the only person on the bar. Imagine one barista making every single drink for every single person that comes here for hours. It’s exhausting. We’re burnt out.” Kasey Copeland barista and trainer

Copeland and her colleagues alleged that Starbucks continually expects each employee to pick up the work that used to be allocated to multiple people often leaving them with no choice but to stay past the end of their shift while Starbucks sidesteps the bargaining structure required by U.S. labor law.

Unionization Wave Reached Minneapolis Location in May

The Cedar Avenue Starbucks joins a fast-growing number of unionized Starbucks locations jumpstarted by the first unionized store in Buffalo N.Y. in December of 2021. Since then 318 stores nationwide have filed to unionize through Starbucks Workers United an SEIU affiliate. Two hundred and nineteen of those stores voted to approve the union 46 have rejected it and the rest have elections in progress.

In May the Cedar Avenue store voted 14-3 to unionize. Shortly thereafter workers said the conditions declined even further from what they had come to expect in terms of staffing numbers and scheduling issues. The store’s opening was shifted 30 minutes later on weekends after most of the morning shift employees joined the organizing committee shortening the morning shifts. Certain employees were taken off the schedule outright for days at a time.

Though similar unilateral decisions from management have gone uncontested before the difference this time is that workers had a newfound familiarity with their protections under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). In the wake of their unionizing effort as Copeland said “Maybe it’s just a coincidence but it’s a lot of coincidences you know?”

Additionally as outlined in the NLRA it is the responsibility of both employers and employees to “confer in good faith with respect to wages hours and other terms and conditions of employment.” Once the employees are represented by a labor organization Starbucks may not make unilateral decisions around things like store hours and hiring practices without a bargaining process actions which employees at the Cedar Avenue store say have continued and even escalated since the union formed.

The strike was planned to last only two days because of Starbucks’ retaliatory responses to organized stores during the union push of the past several months. Emily Mahoney a shift supervisor who has worked with the company for five years said the main reason behind the strategy of a contained strike is to avoid firings:

“We don’t want anybody to get fired. Legally if we say we’re striking over an unfair labor practice—here’s where we’re starting here’s where we’re ending—that’s just less retaliation against everybody. We’ve seen other folks get fired in more high profile stores and that makes people a little nervous.” Emily Mahoney shift supervisor

National Anti-Union & Anti-Worker Policies

Starbucks founded in 1971 is currently led by CEO Howard Schultz who has a net worth of $4 billion and a decades-long record of anti-union business practices. The store in Buffalo NY was not the first to move towards unionization. The company fought union drives in the past: Seattle in 1985 New York City in 2004 Philadelphia in 2019.

In 2019 workers at a Philadelphia Starbucks location began a union drive only to be discharged from their positions after the company “closely monitored their public social media activity attempted to gauge employees’ support for the employees’ efforts and unlawfully spied on protected conversations one of the employees initiated with coworkers” according to a 2021 NLRB ruling in favor of the baristas. Though the company was penalized for unlawful union retaliation in the 2019 effort this most recent wave of worker organizing has faced more subtle pushback from Starbucks Corporate.

In October 2020 Unicorn Riot reported on a Starbucks at 1900 Market St. in Philadelphia where an employee filed a complaint with the NLRB alleging she was punished with a reduction in hours for organizing a strike and was told not to discuss working conditions with her coworkers.

Schultz said in a town hall this spring that Starbucks is “being assaulted in many ways by the threat of unionization” and that employees should have no need for a union at a company that listens so well to their needs.

“Schultz refers to the union as like an outside force that’s coming in” Copeland said. “Actually it’s your five year your ten year partners who are out here saying enough is enough. The longer people have been here the easier it is to convince them.”

Starbucks has started to close down stores in several major cities that are in various stages of organizing including Washington D.C. and Seattle. The company cites safety concerns as the reason behind the closures though many workers and union representatives say that the move is a thinly veiled attempt to discourage union activity.

To further subdue union efforts Starbucks announced in May that all tenured employees will receive a wage increase and enhanced training. However because the NLRA prohibits unilateral decision-making at unionized stores the company said these benefits will not apply to union employees without a bargaining process.

Starbucks is currently facing complaints of over 200 violations of the NLRA including one from a Minneapolis location 5351 Lyndale Ave S. filed on July 18 alleging coercive actions and statements restricting employees’ right to self-organization.

For now workers at the Cedar Avenue store said all their energy is focused on bringing Starbucks management to the negotiating table to sign a contract that will ensure sustainable working conditions and equitable pay. “It’s hard to even fathom a world where we won’t all be struggling for money anymore” Copeland said.

“Ideally we won’t be flat broke every week on Saturday after our check came out Friday because we had to pay all of our bills. And that’s definitely a longer and bigger fight. But I think this is an important step. I do think that forcing [Schultz] to pay people at least enough that they can afford to live would be ideal. It’s the bare minimum that they owe us at this point. Honestly we make them all of their money.” Kasey Copeland barista and trainer

Even with their tightly focused demands both Copeland and Mahoney said that the scope of the movement they have entered is important to them. “When the next strike happens whoever it is we will show up because they’ve all shown up for us like you see today with all these people out here” Copeland said.

In the days since the strike ended workers say that they have seen very little change. The new store schedule has remained in effect and they still struggle to adequately fill the shifts. Copeland said that their manager reached out to them to address the week that they were removed from the schedule directly following the strike claiming it was an accidental oversight. Still they said tensions with the store’s manager and corporate Starbucks are running high as a result of how they handled the strike along with the continued poor daily working conditions.

Mahoney said that while the days on the picket line brought hope and inspiration for what is possible to the members of their union workers are prepared for a scenario in which the initial strike is not enough for Starbucks to negotiate for a fair contract. “I think it’s going to take a couple more [strikes]” she said. “There are a few more stores in the country that are on strike right now. All of us working together on that really large scale is what is going to help.”

Copeland added “I’m hoping Starbucks makes the right choice and comes to the bargaining table. But so far my hopes have been in vain. I imagine we might end up out here again.”

It hopes to be like Starbucks.,"A Trader Joe’s in downtown Minneapolis became the second unionized location in the US on Friday less than a month after a Massachusetts location became the first. One in Boulder Colorado could be next bringing the effort to unionize the grocery chain across the country. There will likely be many more in between.

This could be the start of a mass union effort at Trader Joe’s in which victory leads to victory and unions become a reality for America’s retail and hospitality workers who are among the lowest paid.

In other words Trader Joe’s could be the next Starbucks.

After a Starbucks in Buffalo New York became the first company-owned location to unionize last December more than 215 other stores around the country have done the same. That initial win set off a chain reaction of Starbucks workers working together to share notes on how more locations could organize. Workers explained the unionization process shared tips with their colleagues and told would-be union members what anti-union tactics to expect from the company. The strategy seems to be paying off as more Starbucks employees join union ranks every week.

“That’s our vision. That’s what we want” Sarah Beth Ryther a worker at the Minneapolis Trader Joe’s told Recode last week ahead of the union vote. “We really and truly are interested in creating a larger movement because we are all going through the same things.”

Trader Joe’s a California-headquartered grocery chain known for outfitting employees in Hawaiian shirts and offering higher-end goods at lower-end prices has more than 500 locations in more than 40 US states. Workers at the two newly unionized locations say they’ve heard from peers interested in unionizing in every state where there’s a Trader Joe’s.

There’s a reason workers say that more than 50 years after Trader Joe’s was founded three separate stores all got the idea to unionize pretty much at once. The company’s retail employees nationwide are facing the same issues regarding worker safety pay that’s no longer competitive and benefits that aren’t as good as they used to be.

“Trader Joe’s earned the reputation they have for being a good place to work by taking care of us and listening to us” said Woody Hoagland who’s been at Trader Joe’s for 14 years and whose store in Massachusetts was the first to unionize. “Then it started to slowly get chipped away and it really took a pretty precipitous fall during the pandemic.”

Hoagland explained that making $24 an hour which is near the maximum he can get at a Trader Joe’s store in his area still makes it very difficult to pay rent on an apartment for himself and his two kids. As the cost of goods has risen much faster than wages he says Trader Joe’s is no longer offering a living wage. Meanwhile in recent years the company has minimized its retirement benefits and raised requirements to receive health care while their jobs have become more dangerous thanks to the pandemic.

The other big reason Trader Joe’s is unionizing now of course is the organizing activity at Starbucks. The recent spate of successful unionizations at the coffee giant showed workers at Trader Joe’s that it was possible for them too. And there are a lot of similarities between the two companies.

As people have historically done at Starbucks many came to work for Trader Joe’s because of the reputation it had for being a good place to work. Like Starbucks workers Trader Joe’s employees became inadvertent front-line workers who forged tight bonds with coworkers over their shared experiences working in person during the pandemic. Trader Joe’s and Starbucks organizers both say they’re trying to hold their companies to the higher standard the companies themselves have set lest they become just as bad as other retailers. Even their demands are similar: better pay better benefits more safety precautions and a bigger say in how the store is run.

“While we are concerned about how this new rigid legal relationship will impact Trader Joe’s culture we are prepared to immediately begin discussions with their collective bargaining representative to negotiate a contract” a Trader Joe’s spokesperson said in an email to Recode. “Trader Joe’s offers all of its Crew Members across the country an industry-leading package of pay benefits and flexible working conditions. We are committed to responding quickly when circumstances change to ensure we are doing the right thing to support our Crew.”

Workers at Trader Joe’s and Starbucks also say they need unions to claw back worker protections that eroded as the highly unionized manufacturing economy gave way to the low-paying service industry. The pandemic brought an already bad situation to a boiling point and spurred workers to fight back. A tight job market means workers have more leverage now than they have had in recent history. And pro-union sentiment makes now as good a time as any to change things.

Some 70 percent of non-union workers said they’d join a union at their primary workplace in a new survey by career services site Jobcase. Of these skilled and hourly workers 41 percent said they’re more likely to do so now than they would have been three years ago. A Gallup poll last year found the highest approval rate for unions in nearly 60 years. And union filing petitions were up 57 percent in the first half of fiscal year 2022 compared with 2021 according to the National Labor Relations Board.

It’s a long journey though from filing for a union to actually getting one. First a majority of workers at a particular store need to vote in favor of a union which itself isn’t an easy task since the company can use workers’ time on the job to convince them otherwise. And if the workers organizing do win the vote the union and company then have to negotiate a contract which both have to agree to — a process that can be lengthy if it happens at all.

And while Trader Joe’s bears many similarities to Starbucks — both progressive companies that have resorted to union-busting tactics their employees say — there are differences too. Trader Joe’s stores are typically much larger than Starbucks. The unionized Trader Joe’s locations for instance have about 80 employees while a typical Starbucks has around 25. Union organizers say it’s much easier to organize small groups because it’s more intimate and easy to connect one-on-one.

The first two Trader Joe’s unions have organized under an independent union Trader Joe’s United similar to how Amazon workers in Staten Island founded their own union. That independent status helps avoid criticism that these union movements are being forced from the outside. (The Trader Joe’s location in Boulder has joined forces with a much larger existing union the United Food and Commercial Workers). Meanwhile Starbucks stores are unionizing under the umbrella of Workers United an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union. Still these Starbucks employees say their union is very much worker-led even if it leans on another union for help.

The differences however aren’t stopping Trader Joe’s and Starbucks workers from trying to support each other’s efforts. Unionized workers at a nearby Starbucks showed up to support Minneapolis Trader Joe’s workers at their rally last week and Trader Joe’s United has been broadly supportive of Starbucks’ organizing efforts.

“They showed up for us and we’ll show up for them” Ryther said.

More importantly Trader Joe’s workers around the country are reaching out to one another offering advice exchanging tips and hoping their union effort catches on as fast as Starbucks’.

These Trader Joe’s victories are one of several high-profile union wins this year at places people don’t normally expect unions. Stores as far afield as Apple stores or outdoor apparel retailer REI are taking advantage of a unique point in time to eke out better conditions for American workers.

Of course their leverage might only last as long as hiring remains difficult and the economy is good. But for now it’s looking strong.

Update August 15 9 am: Updated with a statement from Trader Joe’s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2YuZWF0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvOC8xMy8yMzMwNDIxMy9zdGFyYnVja3Mtc3RyaWtlLXNhbnRhLWNydXrSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Workers in Santa Cruz Just Went on Strike,"On Saturday August 13 workers at a unionized Starbucks store in Santa Cruz will go on a three-day strike. Organizer Joe Thompson a Starbucks shift supervisor who remains a member of the Starbucks Workers United union says the stoppage is due to alleged unfair labor practices: Starbucks announced “unilateral changes to hours” denied wage and benefit improvements based on union membership and disturbed the union’s ability to distribute pro-union materials Thompson says. Rallies will be held at noon Saturday outside of 745 Ocean Street Starbucks location as the Ocean store is the only location participating in the strike. Starbucks workers have held strikes in at least 17 states and two Santa Cruz locations became the first California shops to unionize in May.

Thompson anticipates the majority of the staff will strike from the beginning 5:30 a.m. to the end of the stoppage on Tuesday August 16 at 5:29 a.m. The organizer says there was no singular inciting incident for this work stoppage citing instead a “generally hostile environment.” Thompson says the 24 unionized employees all voted unanimously to stop work. “We’ve received a lot of support from community partners first responders and it feels amazing to have everyone’s resources behind us” Thompson says.

The NLRB is currently processing numerous labor practice charges against Starbucks. The mega company has been the subject of negative press for its dubious behavior regarding the union during the past year. For the partners in Santa Cruz and Thompson specifically it’s about remaining in the fight. Intermittent striking is illegal so Thompson says the staff will follow guidelines and continue to demonstrate accordingly on behalf of worker rights. “Labor law in the United States is terrible” Thompson says. “The majority of workers who voted to go on the three day also voted to go on an indefinite strike. If we need to strike over something again we have support from our employees.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbW9udGNsYWlybG9jYWwubmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4L2NodXJjaC1zdHJlZXQtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWluLW1vbnRjbGFpci11bmlvbml6ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church Street Starbucks In Montclair Unionizes,"Montclair’s Starbucks at Church and South Park Streets became the fourth Starbucks in New Jersey to unionize.

In October 2021 the parent company of the world’s most popular social media platform decided to change its name from Facebook (FB) to Meta Platforms (META) as part of an ongoing shift to the metaverse.

As a result the corporation created a new business unit called the “Reality Labs” that will be in charge of developing this virtual realm.

META stock shed 62% of its value in 2022 as the compnay grappled with poor financial performance and macro woes. It seems that some of Facebook’s backers have fled the scene in fear that this pivot could threaten to derail the firm’s financial performance in the future.

Who are Facebook shareholders at the moment and why should investors care? In this article we share the details about who owns the most shares of Facebook and what influence they might have on the future of the business.

What is Meta Platforms (META)?

Meta Platforms is the name of the company that was formerly known as Facebook. Founded in 2004 by a group of Harvard students including its current CEO Mark Zuckerberg after they created a social app called The Facebook.

Since then Facebook has grown to become the world’s largest social media platform with approximately 2.9 billion monthly active users. In addition the parent company acquired two widely successful mobile apps Instagram and WhatsApp whose results are now being reported under the segment Family of Apps.

As per the latest quarterly report Meta Platforms’ Family of Apps had a combined monthly active people (MAP) of 3.65 billion – almost half of the world’s population.

On 28 October last year Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms. The new name is considered to be a better reflection of the business’s aim to become a leading player in the up-and-coming metaverse industry. The ticker symbol assigned to the company’s Class A common shares was changed from FB to META.

In 2022 Meta Platforms generated a revenue of over 116 billion U.S. dollars a slight decrease on the previous year. The majority of Meta’s profits come from its advertising revenue which amounted to 113.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. Meta Platforms employs over 80000 people.

The groups share price rose in February when it beat analysts estimates for its Q4 earnings release with earning per share coming in at $1.76 and revenue at $32.17bn vs $31.53bn expected according to Refinitiv.

Facebook biggest shareholders: What is Mark Zuckerberg’s stake?

Who are the stakeholders of Facebook? According to Meta Platform’s latest annual report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Mark Zukerberg owns over 800000 Class A Shares and over 300000000 Class B Shares. The next biggest share holders are the groups CFO Susan Li and Chief Product Officer Christopher K. Cox.

3258 stockholders of record held the company’s Class A common stock by the end of December 2022.

Other 5% shareholders inculde BlackRock FMR LLC and Vanguard.

As of 31 March 2023 Meta had 2215650705 shares of Class A common stock and 350578831 shares of Class B common stock outstanding.

Holders of Class B META shares are entitled to have 10 votes for every share they own while Class A stockholders only have one vote per share. These votes can be cast during any stockholders’ meeting to decide on the company’s affairs.

The annual report also disclosed that there were 2.3 billion Class A common stock of Meta Platforms in circulation by 28 January 2022 along with 412.86 million Class B common stock.

This information is important for Meta Platforms shareholders and prospective investors. All decisions concerning the company’s vision future and strategy will have to be approved by Zuckerberg as he holds the majority of the company’s voting power.

According to data compiled by Refinitiv as of June 2022 other top executive holders of the company’s stock include Michael Todd Schroepfer David Wehner David Fischer Jennifer Newstead and Peter Thiel.

Today that number is closer to 120.

You can find 16 of those 60 lost beds in one of their West End campus' transitional care cottages once a haven for Montana's golden generation now shuttered.

Seven other entire Treasure State nursing homes have been forced to close in 2022: three in western Montana and one each in Bozeman Malta Red Lodge and Hardin (Hi-Line Retirement in Malta transitioned from a nursing home to an assisted living facility.) And reduced beds in almost every one of the state's remaining homes is the equivalent to closing another dozen.

MTN News Seven Montana nursing homes have closed in 2022 with more expected in the second half of the year.

The reason is twofold: One there are not enough trained professionals to staff the buildings; and two Medicaid reimbursement rates set by the state legislature are nowhere near high enough to keep these businesses afloat.

""We're living in a totally different time over the last six years"" said David Trost President and CEO of St. John's.

In reality Trost started to notice changes much longer ago - around 1997 when the Federal Government repealed the Boren Amendment.

""There were laws in place to require states to reimburse nursing homes for their cost"" Trost said. ""Those laws were repealed which allowed states to pay nursing homes whatever they were willing to accept.""

Trost who was a nursing home administrator at the time of the repeal said St. John’s nursing home wing was losing about $500000 a year back then a number they could cover. But now?

""Today those numbers are over $3 million for St. John’s alone"" he said.

CASEY CONLON / MTN News A transitional cottage at St. John's United has sat empty for two years because of the inability to find staffing.

So six years ago St. John’s started to change their model reducing their number of beds in hopes to better allocate their shrinking resources. The empty cottage was closed as a COVID management tool midway through 2020 but when the facility went to re-open their was no staff - and no money to pay for that staff - to do it.

""We’re competing with the types of businesses we didn’t compete with before"" said Rose Hughes executive director of the Montana Healthcare Association. ""If you can earn $15-20 in a restaurant that might be an easier job physically mentally emotionally than taking care of nursing home residents.""

A lot of employees are being poached by nursing agencies which charge facilities up to three times more.

""We're paying certified nursing assistants $40 $50 an hour"" Trost said ""but we’re having to pay some travelers to travel to Montana to serve us $110 an hour"" Trost said.

""Most businesses can raise prices to accommodate paying their workers more"" Hughes added. ""With nursing homes it all comes back to the fact that 70% of people are on Medicaid.""

Medicaid is the principal payment source for long-term care in America especially for low-income and elderly individuals. State legislatures determine what rate they will pay a nursing home for daily care of each patient.

""For St. John’s in 2020 our cost report said our daily costs were $320 a day"" Trost said. ""Our reimbursement was around $208 a day. That’s where our deficit of $3 million comes from.""

MTN News

St. John’s latest rate for fiscal year 2023 - $214.13.

When asked why rates have not been raised to meet inflation costs Montana’s Department of Health and Human Services said there were no current plans to add funding.

“The department has been clear about our intentions to address Medicaid provider rates in collaboration with the Legislature"" DPHHS told MTN in a statement. ""The reality is the Legislature has not authorized additional supplemental funding for DPHHS to address rates at this time.”

Montana’s current administration says declining nursing home populations over the last decade show the current model isn’t working especially in rural areas and DPHHS has told providers to explore alternative models such as assisted living. But those facilities are only able to accept Medicaid patients through a waiver system and most limit the amount they take.

""Why?"" Hughes asked. ""Because rates for assisted living aren’t what they need to be either. (DPHHS' study) shows those rates are 20% too low.""

PAUL HUMPHREY / MTN News A resident at a St. John's United transitional care cottage reads a newspaper in the building's common area.

The state has a legal obligation to re-home Medicaid nursing residents of closed facilities but as more and more close those residents get farther and farther from the most important things in their life.

""When you separate them from their family care will go down"" Trost said. ""Care is not just what we're able to medically provide our patients. It’s about our ability to connect with people who are a part of their support system. If they are moved away from them (residents) will decline at a much faster rate.""

Ultimately providers say this disturbing trend will continue unless the state allocates significantly more funding to keep facilities open.

A repair technician for St. Paul Public Schools Thompson emerged as a prominent activist while protesting the 2016 police shooting of a friend and coworker Philando Castile. In 2020 he won a seat representing St. Paul’s East Side in the Minnesota House of Representatives pledging to fight for criminal justice reform affordable housing and free public transportation.

Thompson seemed no more attached to political niceties this past week as his tenure in the Minnesota House of Representatives neared its end. On Tuesday night the St. Paul politician suffered an overwhelming loss to Liz Lee in the primary election.

Lee a former congressional staffer secured 89 percent of the vote in her victory against Thompson who gathered 11 percent of the vote.

Having entered the house with a bold agenda Thompson 50 spent the past year responding to a series of scandals: a late-night traffic stop and a run-in with a St. Paul police officer; questions about his residency; and the release of police reports describing allegations of domestic violence. House Democrats voted last September to expel Thompson from the DFL caucus.

Despite his loss in the primary Thompson sounded animated and unbowed on Thursday when he spoke to Sahan Journal by phone.

“I feel good. I’m still living breathing and talking. I’m blessed and highly favored” Thompson said. “I’m not going to go in this closet and hide.”

Thompson said he wasn’t surprised by the results of Tuesday’s primary. But he did express surprise that St. Paul voters cast their ballots for Lee–someone he said he had never heard of before the primary—in such considerable numbers.

“Where was she at post-Philando? Where was this woman at post-Jamar Clark?” Thompson asked referring to Black men fatally shot by police. “Check her address” he added—a reference to questions that surfaced about his Wisconsin driver’s license.

Liz Lee 33 grew up in public housing on St. Paul’s East Side with her parents and four siblings.

“I’m not bitter about Liz Lee” Thompson continued. “I hope she does well. I hope she wins by the way because she ain’t won nothing yet. I don’t think that they actually put up a good fight. They actually just came in and put a lot of money in.”

He paused to count–aloud–the 30 Liz Lee and Betty McCollum mailers that he said arrived at his home over the past few weeks. The DFL outreach effort did not impress him.

“This party is full of shit” he said.

A turbulent and controversial term

Thompson highlighted a few accomplishments from his term. He mentioned investments in his district: “I brought almost $7 million in investments to the East Side my freshman year” Thompson said.

But then he pivoted back to the moments of controversy: “They don’t want to talk about that. They want to talk about me bullying police officers.”

In Thompson’s nearly 45-minute phone conversation with Sahan Journal he seemed more keen on airing grievances than discussing points of pride from his work in office.

During his term Thompson addressed his original campaign pledges to uplift the Black community in St. Paul. He introduced legislation to provide reparations to descendants of enslaved people in Minnesota prohibit qualified immunity for police officers and fund business developments in the East Side–something he hoped would “take the economic noose off” his community’s neck. These measures did not pass the legislature.

Thompson maintains that the various allegations that derailed his career were untrue and made in bad faith.

“Name one Black man who fought for human rights who hasn’t been slandered” Thompson said. He then drew a parallel between his experiences and both Melvin Carter’s run for office and the Biblical Jesus.

“Jesus’ Black life–they still slandered Jesus’ name” Thompson said.

Thompson ran as an independent in this week’s primary. In his conversation with Sahan Journal he compared his ostracization from the Democratic Party to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till the Black Mississippi teenager who was lynched after a white woman alleged he’d harrassed her in a grocery store.

“I remember who pointed out Emmett Till and got him killed. The attack never changed just the faces” he said. “We got to silence this Black man because he’s telling too much of the truth” he continued.

Republicans and top Democrats including Governor Tim Walz and Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan called for Thompson’s resignation last year following controversies that began with a traffic stop.

After pulling over Thompson for a missing front license plate a police officer discovered that the state had revoked Thompson’s driving privileges for failing to pay child support. Thompson accused the officer of racial profiling.

“You pulled me over because you saw a Black face in this car brother” Thompson said in body camera footage of the traffic stop.

The officer also found that Thompson carried a Wisconsin driver’s license that he had last renewed after his election to the Minnesota legislature. This discovery raised questions about Thompson’s eligibility for office.

In the search for more information about Thompson’s residency Fox 9 surfaced five police reports detailing domestic violence allegations against Thompson. Thompson and his lawyer denied the allegations.

The controversy surrounding Thompson posed a moral quandary for many racial and gender justice activists. While many Democrats have pushed for a zero-tolerance policy on gender-based violence some progressives worried that Thompson was being singled out while white politicians avoided censure.

“I believe survivors every single time” Asma Mohamed advocacy director at Reviving the Islamic Sisterhood for Empowerment told Sahan Journal last July. “And I also know Black men are being held to a different standard. And I think John Thompson is being held to a standard we would not expect of anyone else.”

Thompson said that bad-faith accusations rather than his own actions led to his loss in the primary. “There’s no way you’d beat John Thompson without slander. You can’t” he said referring to himself in the third person.

‘I refuse to conform’

Thompson didn’t think that his time in office allowed him to effect the sort of change that he’d wanted.

“Here I am right now in 2022 and we’re talking about police reform. Police will never be reformed” he said. Thompson noted that Americans have been discussing police reform for decades.

“They’d rather see these cookie cutters who’ve never been through any type of adversity. If we get Scott Jensen if we get Governor Walz we get the same thing: a white man running the state.”

He placed the blame in part on the homogeneity of politics. “They’d rather see these cookie cutters who’ve never been through any type of adversity” Thompson said. “If we get Scott Jensen if we get Governor Walz we get the same thing: a white man running the state.”

His term in office he said was his chance to break the mold.

“I was never doing this for the money or the fame or the accolades. I was actually doing this for our people who don’t have a voice at the state capitol” Thompson said. “I refuse to conform because the system won’t conform for my people.”

What comes next?

Thompson’s vocal activism around police shootings and racial justice thrust him into the political limelight. But he now sounds less sure of himself and what his future holds. Before taking any next steps he said that he needed to talk with his loved ones first.

“I don’t make any decisions without my family” he said.

The representative didn’t mince words when asked what he learned from his term.

“I learned that politics is full of shit” he said laughing. “And that some of our favorite politicians are the same way–full of shit. And you can quote me on that. I mean that in the most disrespectful way.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXNzbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4L21hc3NhY2h1c2V0dHMtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLWZvci1oYW1wZGVuLWhhbXBzaGlyZS1hbmQtZnJhbmtsaW4tY291bnRpZXMtYXVndXN0LTE0LTIwMjItZWRpdGlvbi5odG1s0gGjAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvbWFzc2FjaHVzZXR0cy1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtZm9yLWhhbXBkZW4taGFtcHNoaXJlLWFuZC1mcmFua2xpbi1jb3VudGllcy1hdWd1c3QtMTQtMjAyMi1lZGl0aW9uLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Massachusetts real estate transactions for Hampden Hampshire and Franklin counties August 14 2022,"Agawam

Primary neuron cultures were prepared from Wistar rats (P0–P2) according to the guidelines of the Italian Animal Welfare Act and the European Union guidelines for animal care (d.1.116/92; 86/609/C.E.). Their use was approved by the Local Veterinary Service the SISSA Ethics Committee board and the National Ministry of Health. Both hippocampal and cortical neurons were used for the experiments. Hippocampus and cortex isolated from the brain were subjected to enzymatic digestion with a solution containing NaCl 136.9 mM KCl 4.9 mM Na 2 HPO 4 7 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) 25.2 mM NaHCO 3 4.2 mM Kinurenic Acid 200 μM and D(-)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) 25 μM (all from Sigma-Aldrich® St. Louis MO). Neurons obtained from hippocampus and cortex digestion were then plated on 15 mm glass coverslips (Menzel-Glaser cat. no. CB00150RA1) previously coated with Poly-l-Ornithine (Sigma-Aldrich® cat. no. P4957) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml and cultured in Neural Basal-A Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA Cat. no. 21103049) supplemented with GlutaMAXTM Supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. 35050061) Gentamicin solution 10 mg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich® Cat. no. G1272) and B27TM Supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. 17504044) at 37 °C 5% CO 2 .

Human Astrocytes (HAs) (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. N7805100) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with GlutaMAX™ supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen Life Technologies Gaithersburg MD cat. no. 31966047 and ECS0180L) 1% PenStrep (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. 15070063) and N2 Supplement 100X (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. 17502048). Once 70–80% of confluence was achieved the cells were re-plated. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C 5% CO 2 and the medium was replaced every 3 days. HA-derived exosomes were used as a control to verify the specificity of the effect of the U87 exosomes.

Human U87 GBM cells (Sigma-Aldrich® cat. no. 89081402) is a cell line with epithelial morphology originally isolated from a malignant glioma of a male patient. U87 cells were cultured in DMEM with GlutaMAX™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen Life Technologies) 1% PenStrep (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin Thermo Fisher Scientific). The medium was replaced every 3 days. Once 70–80% of confluence was reached cells were re-plated.

To obtain glioma-associated stem cells (GASCs) human GBM samples were collected by the Neurosurgery Department of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria of Udine. The local Ethics Committee Comitato Etico Unico Regionale del Friuli Venezia Giulia approved this investigation (protocol number 718345 opinion 196/2014/Em). Briefly tissue samples were mechanically/enzymatically dissociated and single-cell suspensions were cultured in adhesion on fibronectin-coated dishes as previously described [12]. All cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination.

Exosome isolation

When cells reached 70–80% confluence FBS was substituted with 1% exosome-depleted serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. A2720803) is contained in the culture medium; cells were then left in culture for an additional 24 h (HA and U87 cells) or 48 h (GASCs) before collecting media to perform exosome isolation. After centrifugation at 2000 × g for 30 min to remove cells and debris the supernatant was transferred into new tubes and subjected to exosome isolation using Total Exosome Isolation reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies cat. no. 4478359) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly 0.5 volumes of the reagent were added to the supernatant and the solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C. After ultra-centrifugation at 10000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C the supernatant was removed and the exosome pellet resuspended in 150 μl of PBS and stored at −80 °C. To treat control samples each type of culture medium used for incubation to isolate exosomes which was never been in contact with cells was subjected to the same protocol of exosome extraction. Cortical and hippocampal neurons were treated using 4.2 × 103 particles (exosomes) per cell for 24 h at two different stages of maturation: 4 DIV and 7–12 DIV.

Exosome characterization

NanoSight

Isolated exosomes were analyzed using a 405 nm (violet) laser at the NanoSight LM10 (Malvern Panalytical) to verify their size and concentration.

Atomic force microscopy

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measures were performed to visualize and further characterize exosomes. AFM images were acquired using a commercially available microscope (MFP-3D Stand Alone AFM from Asylum Research Santa Barbara CA) in dynamic AC-mode in liquid using commercially available silicon cantilevers (BL-AC40TS- C2 Olympus Micro Cantilevers nominal spring constant 0.09 N m −1 and resonant frequency 110 kHz). For the preparation of the sample: a freshly cleaved muscovite mica sheet (Ruby Muscovite Mica Scratch Free Grade V-1 Nanoandmore GMBH USA) was incubated with a drop of poly-l-ornithine solution 0.01% (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Subsequently the excess poly-lysine was removed by performing five washes with Milli-Q water. A 15 µm drop of exosome suspension was then applied to the poly-ornithine-coated mica surface at RT for 15–30 min to allow the vesicles to bind the surface via electrostatic interactions. Samples were then washed with PBS 5 times and transferred to the AFM microscope. For each sample 3–5 images with 10 × 10 µm of scan size and with a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels (pixel size ~10 × 10 nm) were acquired. The AFM images were analyzed with the Gwyddion® software to extract vesicle heights and diameters.

Exosome markers expression

The expression of exosome markers was evaluated by Western Blot. Exosomes isolated from cell culture medium were resuspended in CHAPS Cell Extract Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology Danvers MA USA cat. no. 9852S) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. 78430). 4X Laemmli buffer was added to the samples and after denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min 30 µg/lane were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond® ECLTM nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences cat. no. LC2000) by the semi-dry system Trans-Blot® TurboTM Transfer System (Biorad cat. no. 1704150) at 1.3 A and 25 V for 1 h. After blocking in 3% BSA (Bovine serum albumin Sigma-Aldrich®) for 1 h at RT membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Flotillin 1 (Abcam Cambridge UK 1:500 cat. no. ab41927) rabbit polyclonal anti-TSG101 (Abcam 1:500 cat. no. ab133586) and mouse monoclonal anti-Alix (1:1000 Cell Signaling Technology cat. no. 2171) were used as exosome markers while rabbit monoclonal anti-GM130 (1:1000 Cell Signaling Technology cat. no. 12480) was used as Golgi apparatus marker. After three 5 min washes in TBS with 0.1%Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich® cat. n. P9416) membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Agilent Palo Alto CA USA cat. no. P0449 and P0447) for 1 h at RT washed three times as previously incubated for 3–5 min. in Immobilon® ECL Ultra Western HRP Substrate (Sigma-Aldrich® cat. no. 42029053) and analyzed with the transilluminator NineAllianceTM (Uvitec Cambridge UK).

Calcium imaging

In order to perform Ca2+ imaging experiments and observe intracellular Ca2+ transients after exosome treatment 1.0 × 105 hippocampal or cortical neurons were cultured on 15 mm glass coverslips. On the day of the experiment cells were first incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with 4 μM membrane-permeable Ca2+ dye Fluo-4 AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. F14201) and 0.1% (v/v) Pluronic F-127 (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. P3000MP) in Ringer’s solution (145 mM NaCl 3 mM KCl 1.5 mM CaCl 2  1 mM MgCl 2  10 mM glucose and 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4); after three washes in Ringer’s solution for 20 min each the coverslips were transferred to a 35 mm µ-Dish for high-end microscopy (Ibidi Gräfelfing Germany cat. no. 81156). Recordings were performed at 37 °C for 10 min using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U inverted microscope equipped with a piezoelectric table (Nano-ZI Series 500 μm range Mad City Labs) an HBO 103W/2 mercury short arc lamp (Osram Munich Germany) a mirror unit (465–495 nm excitation bandpass filter 505 nm dichroic 515–555 nm emission bandpass filter) and an Electron Multiplier CCD Camera C9100-13 (Hamamatsu Photonics Japan). Images were acquired using the NIS Element software (Nikon Japan) with a S-Fluor ×20/0.75 NA objective at a sampling rate of 0.3 and with a spatial resolution of 256 × 256 pixels. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software (Rasband W.S. ImageJ U.S. National Institutes of Health Bethesda MD USA) and a custom-build MATLAB code (The MathWorks Inc. Natick MA USA https://www.mathworks.com as previously described [53]. To avoid image saturation excitation light intensity was attenuated by ND4 and ND8 neutral density filters (Nikon Tokyo Japan).

Extracellular electrophysiological recordings

Commercial MEAs (Multichannel Systems GmBH Reutlingen Germany) were used to monitor the extracellular electrical activity in cortical neuronal cultures. Each MEA contains 120 titanium nitrate (TiN) microelectrodes with a diameter of 30 μm and an inter-electrode distance of 100 μm arranged as a 12 × 10 regular layout. MEA’s electrodes detected extracellular action potentials from neurons located in their proximity. We employed an electronic multichannel amplifier (MEA2100-Mini-120-System Multichannel Systems GmBH Reutlingen Germany) with 10–10000 Hz bandwidth and an amplification factor of 1. Recordings were performed inside of a (dry) incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 (C150 Binder GmbH Tuttlingen Germany). Evaporation was strongly reduced by sealing MEAs with PDMS caps and controlled over 24 h recording sessions by direct measurements: changes in osmolality did not exceed 10% after 24 h. Extracellular raw electrical signals were sampled at 25 kHz/channel and digitized at 16 bits of resolution by the MEA2100–Mini USB interface. The raw voltage traces were analyzed with custom scripts written in Julia as previously reported [54] to extract the time of occurrence of action potentials at each MEA microelectrode. Briefly for each recording channel a threshold for peak detection was set adapted depending on the background electrical noise [55]. The Pearson correlation coefficients between spike times in different channels were computed and averaged across 10 s time windows using Matlab codes.

Immunofluorescence staining

For immunofluorescence experiments cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 on 15 mm glass coverslips and cultured for either 3 or 6–11 days after which 4.2 × 103 exosomes per cell were added for 24 h. Subsequently primary cultures were rinsed three times in PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT and kept at 4 °C until staining was performed. For the immunofluorescence staining fixed cultures were rinsed three times in PBS to remove PFA then a glycine solution (glycine 1 mM in PBS) was added for 5 min to reduce autofluorescence. To perform immunostaining of intracellular proteins an additional step with TritonTM X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich®) (0.2% in PBS) of 5 min was added. Cells were then treated with a blocking solution to saturate unspecific binding sites composed of 10% Normal Goat Serum (Sigma-Aldrich® cat. no. NS02L-1ML) 0.1% TweenTM 20 Surfact-AmpsTM detergent solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 5% BSA at RT for 45 min.

Incubation with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-Actin-related protein3 (Arp3; Abcam 1:200 Cat. no. ab4967) polyclonal chicken anti-β3 tubulin (Abcam 1:500 cat. no. ab41489) guinea pig polyclonal anti-vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (VGLUT1; Thermo Fisher Scientific 1:2000 cat. no. AB 5905) polyclonal rabbit anti-postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95; Abcam 1:500 cat. no. ab18258) mouse monoclonal anti-vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT; Synaptic Systems 1:200 cat. no. 131011) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Gephyrin (Genetex 1:250 cat. no. 109734) was conducted at 37 °C for 1 h. The following secondary antibodies were used for the detection: goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen Life Technologies 1:600 cat. no. A11029) goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen 1:600 Cat. no. A11037) donkey anti-chicken Biotin conjugated (Invitrogen 1:600 Cat. no. SA1-72003); streptavidin Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen 1:250 Cat. no. S21374) was used for the detection of biotinylated secondary antibody.

For image acquisition an inverted Nikon A1R confocal microscope (Nikon Japan) was used. Images were acquired using the NIS Element Advanced Research Software (Nikon Japan) with either a ×40/0.95 NA or a ×60/1.40 NA oil-immersion objective and a 3-fold zoom with a spatial resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels. Quantification of fluorescence intensity was measured in regions of interest using the ImageJ software (NIH). Quantification of colocalization was measured with the ImageJ software through the Coloc2 plug-in.

Intracellular electrophysiological recordings

Primary neurons were plated at a density of approximately 1 × 105 on 15 mm glass coverslips and cultured for 6–11 days after which 4.2 × 103 particles per cell were added for 24 h. The electrophysiology experiments were performed in the whole cell patch clamp modality. Hippocampal neurons at 4 DIV were transferred to a recording chamber with a continuous Ringer’s perfusion visualized in an inverted microscope Olympus IX70 equipped with ×20 and ×40 objectives. Neurons were identified by characteristic morphology. Patch pipettes were made of borosilicate glass (WPI Sarasota FL USA) with a PP-830 puller (Narishige Tokyo Japan) and had a resistance of 3–5 MΩ. Voltage recording data were done with an Axopatch 1D amplifier controlled by Clampex 9 via a Digidata 1332A (Axon Instruments Union City CA USA) low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz.

Patch pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution contained (in mM) 140 KCl 4 MgCl 2  10 HEDTA and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. Extracellular Ringer’s solution was composed of 140 NaCl 5 KCl 1 CaCl 2  1 MgCl 2  10 HEPES and 10 mM glucose pH 7.4. Patching pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries (WPI) with a Narishige PC-10 puller and had resistances of 5–10 MΩ. Electrophysiology recordings were obtained using an Axoclamp 700b amplifier controlled by Clampex 10.6 via a Digidata 1550B (Molecular Devices) and filtering with 5 kHz low pass. Recordings in the current clamp were performed in current equal 0 or follower voltage mode. Cells in voltage clamp experiments had a holding potential of −70 mV. Liquid junction potentials were calculated using pClamp 10.6 and a value of 14 mV was obtained (based on ref. [56]); the applied voltages were corrected offline in every trace. Both of the experiments were recorded in continuous gap-free by 2 min. Only neurons that had a stable resting membrane potential showed spikes activity and stable access resistance were included in the statistical analysis. The IGOR Pro software (Wave metrics) was used to create all the electrophysiological figures and to perform statistical tests. Analyses were performed on traces that showed frequencies of action potentials higher than 0.2 Hz. For Total inter-burst time calculation we considered a burst as a train event of at least 4 consecutive action potentials with <4 s ISI. The times among bursts were added and reported as total inter-burst time.

Statistical analysis

Results are shown as mean ± SEM. All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism v.6 (San Diego CA) and MATLAB (The Mathworks Natick USA). The two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used to compare two normally distributed sample groups and equality of variances was tested through the F test while the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare two or more than two non-normally distributed sample groups respectively. When more than two groups were compared one-way ANOVA or repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc multiple comparison tests were performed to assess significance as indicated in figure legends and equality of variances tested through the Brown–Forsythe’s and Bartlett’s test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. No predictive statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes; however we adopted sample sizes (indicated in figure legends) in the same range as those previously reported in the literature for similar experiments. The ROUT method with Q = 1% was used to identify outliers for exclusion from analysis. No randomization method was followed to allocate samples/animals to the various experimental groups. Investigators were not blinded to group allocation but were blinded when assessing the outcome of the experiments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGx0b2RheS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2NvbGxlZ2UvaWxsaW5pL2NoYXNlLWJyb3duLWEtbG9vay1hdC10aGUtaWxsaW5vaXMtZmlnaHRpbmctaWxsaW5pLWZvb3RiYWxsLXJ1bm5pbmctYmFjay9jb2xsZWN0aW9uX2E5YzVkMjg1LTdmZWQtNTdkYy1hYTUwLTNhNzYwMDM2NDZkMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chase Brown: A look at the Illinois Fighting Illini football running back,Illinois football had more offensive yards in its season opener than it did in any game in 2021.

To look at how cellular networks will support the metaverse let’s look at how cellular networks are supporting metaverse efforts today.

Telefónica TIM Group and Deutsche Telekom (DT) collaborated with DoubleMe to create HoloVerse based on TwinWorld DoubleMe’s extant metaverse platform. Their efforts focused on testing edge-based 5G telco cloud network infrastructure for its metaverse suitability. The three carriers operating in Spain Italy and Germany respectively collaborated under the aegis of the GSMA as part of the Telco Edge Cloud consortium to carry out tests on HoloVerse through the end of 2021.

David Moro Telefónica’s head of network service platforms said his company’s goal was to create a new communication service based on the concept.

“Using the TwinWorld platform we can test the possibility of a real-world metaverse in 5G telco edge cloud” Moro added.

The focus of finding performant telco edge cloud network architecture to drive metaverse experiences is telling because central to the metaverse story is the demand for lower network latency and not just by a few more milliseconds. Meta (née Facebook) wants “an order of magnitude” less network latency than users can now expect from “single to low double-digit milliseconds” according to Meta VP Dan Rabinovitsj.

Meta also wants symmetrical bandwidth as well as the development of a common framework for metaverse networking metrics which don’t yet exist. Meta has some big assumptions for how metaverse technology has to work to provide an immersive experience and the “metaverse” concept in general is casting a wider net than just Meta’s interpretation. Meta also readily admits there won’t be only one metaverse nor will it control the others.

So your metaverse mileage may vary at least when it comes to the cellular networks powering the metaverse.

Metaverse networking emerges as a gradual iterative process

There’s plenty of room for more headroom from cellular networks metaverse notwithstanding. Most mobile customers today connect using LTE or 5G NonStandalone (NSA) networks. More bandwidth lower latency orders of magnitude higher device density support and network slicing are all features that await once 5G Standalone (SA) is ready to deploy – all foundational to getting next-generation tech like the metaverse to work the way it’s being envisioned. But so far network operators have been slow on the uptake.

Limited user equipment a smaller base of users and fewer use cases have put a damper on 5G SA rollouts. Market research from Dell’Oro Group suggested in a July report that supply chain challenges growing inflation Russia’s war in Ukraine and increasing revenue pressure from telcos were all working against the deployment of 5G SA networks.

South Korean telco SK Telecom (SKT) isn’t waiting for a common framework or other industry consensus it’s forging ahead with the development of its 5G metaverse platform called Ifland. The company launched the service in 2021 aiming it squarely at Millennial and Gen Z-aged users that it thought would be most receptive to the concept. Ifland lets users create their own virtual environments populated with hundreds of different avatars with customizable appearances. It’s off to a modest start: SKT revealed during its Q2 2022 financial results call with analysts that Ifland which recently reached its first anniversary had garnered 1.63 million monthly active users (MAU) and 8.7 million cumulative downloads. But SKT has bolder plans for Ifland than just as a virtual playground for its own customers. SKT is licensing the tech for other telcos to use too.

“We are also working for gradual expansion into the global market in the second half of the year through close cooperation with leading telecom companies in major regions including Europe North America the Middle East and Asia” said Jin-won Kim SK Telecom CEO.

The company has already found a partner in DT fresh from its HoloVerse testing with TIM and Telefónica. DT and SKT announced a deal in May that will bring Ifland to German customers. They’re creating a virtual version of a real German city. Live trials of the new service are expected to launch before the end of 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL3lvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWJ1eS1hLW5ldy1waG9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This is the year you need to buy a new phone — here's why,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL3lvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWJ1eS1hLW5ldy1waG9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1cnJlbnRhZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8yMDIyLzA4L3doYXQtYXJlLW91ci1waG9uZXMtZG9pbmctdG8tdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What are Our Phones Doing to Us? Current Affairs,"Let’s consider a few data points on America’s relationship with the smartphone. First a recent survey published by SellCell a cellphone price comparison company found that 54 percent of Americans answered “yes” to the question “Would you rather spend time on your phone than in your partner’s company?” with 71 percent reporting that they do in fact spend more personal time with their phone than their partner. Another survey conducted by independent reviewing site Reviews.org found that 41 percent of Americans “say they’d rather give up sex for a year than give up their phone for a year.” Should one doubt the methodological rigor of SellCell gold-standard research firm Pew found in 2021 that over half of Americans say their partner is often or sometimes distracted by their phone when they are trying to have a conversation with them and that nearly one in three adults now says they are “almost constantly” online. It is not difficult to find plenty more troubling statistics: most people now sleep next to their phones never turn their phones off report a sense of panic when their battery is low check their phones within minutes of waking up are uneasy leaving their phones at home touch their phones thousands of times a day and use their phones while using the toilet.

Most 18-year-olds admit to having texted while driving. Nearly half of people sometimes text others who are in the same house. A similar number consider their phones their most valuable possessions and polls have found anywhere between half and three-fourths of Americans confessing to phone addiction. Nearly half of Americans reported spending 5-6 hours a day on their phones. Furthermore the number of people who don’t have smartphones is growing smaller and smaller: 85 percent of Americans now report having a smartphone while 97 percent own a cellphone of some kind.

The reports about the way smartphones have impacted romantic relationships are perhaps the most disquieting. Though arguably sexual desire and love for one’s partner aren’t drives quite as biologically basic as the will to stay alive there is no disputing the fact that for the vast majority of people love and sexual desire are—or until relatively recently were—extraordinarily deeply entrenched aspects of their identities. (Indeed even the small number of Americans who are asexual and who thus experience little to no sexual attraction to others are often still willing partners in romantic relationships.)

One might be tempted to attribute many of the extraordinary recent findings to the coronavirus pandemic which temporarily made everyone much more online. But reports of the replacement of relationships with phones began streaming in years ago. (NBC News 2011: “Survey: One third would rather give up sex than phone”; CNBC 2013: “Sex or Smartphone? Women Prefer the Gadgets”; Bloomberg 2015: “Give Up Sex or Your Mobile Phone? Third of Americans Forgo Sex.”) Furthermore the decline in sexual frequency is well documented. A study in the Archives of Sexual Behavior found that “American adults had sex about nine fewer times per year in the early 2010s compared to the late 1990s.” That might not sound like too much of a difference but the numbers are particularly extreme among younger people as another study in the same journal showed: “Between 2009 and 2018 the proportion of adolescents reporting no sexual activity either alone or with partners rose from 28.8 percent to 44.2 percent among young men and from 49.5 percent in 2009 to 74 percent among young women.” One of the study authors Tsung-chieh (Jane) Fu of the Indiana University School of Public Health explained that “for young people computer games increasing social media use video games—something is replacing that time.”

What the existing data points seem to show is that vast swaths of the U.S. population would prefer to spend time with their personalized high-tech gadgets rather than attempt to foster meaningful human relationships and/or engage in one of life’s most biologically basic activities. Is this healthy? We might be tempted to dismiss the trends as benign or the product of individual choices to maximize happiness. But as journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote in a 2020 article called “The Social Fabric of the U.S. is Fraying Severely if Not Unravelling “there are “very troubling [new] data that reflect intensifying pathologies in the U.S. population—not moral or allegorical sicknesses but mental emotional psychological and scientifically proven sickness.” Greenwald cited a 2020 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) survey which assessed the mental health of American adults. Among other discoveries the report found that 10.7 percent of American adults equating to roughly 20 million Americans had “seriously considered suicide” in the past 30 days—that is “not fleetingly considered [suicide] as a momentary nor thought about it ever in their lifetime” as Greenwald elaborated “but seriously considered suicide at least once in the past thirty days.” Among younger Americans the figures were even more disturbing: more than a quarter (25.5 percent) of American adults between the ages of 18-24 and 16 percent of adults between the ages of 25-44 had thought seriously about taking their own lives during the previous month. Greenwald commented:

“In a remotely healthy society one that provides basic emotional needs to its population suicide and serious suicidal ideation are rare events. It is anathema to the most basic human instinct: the will to live. A society in which such a vast swath of the population is seriously considering it as an option is one which is anything but healthy one which is plainly failing to provide its citizens the basic necessities for a fulfilling life.”

It is certainly possible to point to the pandemic to explain some of the increase in anxiety and depression. But as U.S. News & World Report documents among children “anxiety depression and behavioral problems appear to be on the rise while the amount of time kids spent being physically active or getting preventive care has been on the decline” plus “parental emotional well-being and mental health … [were found] to be suffering in tandem.” The magazine notes that “that was all pre-pandemic” with the pandemic making an already bad situation worse. A 2018 article in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) notes that “Sociologists have observed the decline in various measures of psychosocial well-being in the United States for some time” and “alarming declines in measures such as trust have been documented for decades.” Happiness trust sex frequency and life expectancy have all been in decline while despair has increased which leads the AJPH researchers to conclude that “the United States has experienced what amounts to a social crisis that dates back to at least the 1980s.”

In the context of this social crisis we should be cautious about what we attribute to technology alone. We must also disentangle cause from effect: has addiction to phones torn us apart or has an already-suffering society turned to the narcotic of smartphones to relieve the pain? (The same caution applies when trying to analyze the opioid epidemic and understand the degree to which the drugs are a cause rather than a symptom of other problems in people’s lives.) We do know that material deprivation is clearly a major part of the story—the AJPH cites rising medical costs as a major culprit in declining mental health. But it’s also worth appreciating just how monumental a shift in our living patterns we have undergone as smartphones have become ubiquitous. It is a fact that most of us now spend a significant portion of our day that would once have been spent around physical human beings in an artificial world (there are those in Silicon Valley who even anticipate that we will soon live almost full-time in a dystopian place they call the Metaverse). Surely the switch of huge portions of daily activity from in-person to online has significant effects on us. Smartphone use appears to have a played a major role in reshaping the “internal environment” of the human individual: in particular it appears to have radically restructured what we take to be most important in life—a restructuring which at least prior to the smartphone era many of us would have regarded as overwhelmingly negative.

In fact many Americans seem to recognize the current state of affairs as inherently problematic. According to one survey 73 percent of Americans said that they would be “happier if they spent less time” on their phones with only slightly fewer (70 percent) admitting that smartphones are adversely impacting their relationships with those closest to them. Smartphone use has been credibly linked to a variety of mental and physical afflictions including anxiety depression loneliness short attention spans reduction in reading ability reduced in-person socializing stunted childhood growth general lower intelligence obesity poor eyesight and even suicide. Indeed there is little doubt that smartphone use has in many ways exacerbated and reinforced many of the pathologies confronting contemporary American society. In a country in which for instance more than three-fifths of the population report being lonely (with the figure rising to four-fifths for Gen Z) it is not difficult to understand how spending one’s time on one’s phone addictively scrolling through social media as opposed to forming and sustaining meaningful human relationships is unlikely to alleviate and indeed is much more likely to exacerbate such feelings of desperation. U.S. children now spend a lot of time online (the overwhelming majority of young children spend more time in front of a screen than experts recommend). Parents certainly don’t have terribly high opinions of smartphones. Technology is the number one factor parents cite as making parenting harder today than it used to be and Pew research found that 71 percent of parents think “smartphones will hurt [their] children’s abilities to develop healthy friendships and learn social skills” and the “potential harm [of smartphones] outweighs the potential benefit.”

This does not mean that the parents are necessarily right of course. We also have to acknowledge that even though Americans worry about their addiction to smartphones they also like their phones. One Gallup study found that 70 percent of smartphone users say that smartphones have “made their lives better.” Many may well recognize they are addicted but feel it’s an addiction they’re happy to live with. On this interpretation maybe people really do prefer to be on Instagram rather than spend time with loved ones. Given the choice between having or sustaining a meaningful human relationship and being on their phones they would willingly choose the latter over the former without regrets.

Not all of the smartphone’s effects on human society have been negative. Indeed according to a 2019 Pew poll a significant majority of people in developing countries report that their lives have improved enormously as a result of acquiring cellphones (due to for instance online banking). These results however should be juxtaposed with the fact that the same poll found that significant majorities of people in emerging economies believe that mobile phones “have had a bad influence on children in their country” as well as by the fact that the people in the developing world who actually manufacture smartphones typically work in abominable conditions. Moreover even in the developed world smartphones have certainly made life more convenient in various ways: they allow us to instantly look up an elusive fact at a moment’s notice to almost instantly order food and transport and yes occasionally to talk to loved ones on the other side of the globe. The question is: at what cost?

Johann Hari’s book Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention and How to Think Deeply Again is a useful addition to the conversation around technology addiction and social crisis. Hari’s first book Chasing the Scream focused on the science of addiction and the War on Drugs. His second Lost Connections examined depression. Stolen Focus addresses our current “attention crisis”: according to data cited by Hari a typical office worker today focuses on tasks for just three minutes at a time; college students fare even worse switching tasks on average every sixty-five seconds.

Hari’s interest in the subject is personal as well as scientific. He describes his own experience:

“The sensation of being alive in the early twenty-first century consisted of the sense that our ability to pay attention—to focus—was cracking and breaking. I could feel it happen to me—I would buy piles of books and I would glimpse them guiltily from the corner of my eye as I sent I told myself just one more tweet. I still read a lot but with each year that passed it felt more and more like running up a down escalator.”

This mixture of scientific and personal curiosity—as in Chasing the Scream and Lost Connections—leads Hari on a journey all over the world “from Miami to Moscow from Montreal to Melbourne” interviewing more than 250 experts on human attention. His conclusion is that there are twelve “deep forces” responsible for harming our attention. His goal in the book is to explain what they are and what we need to do to “get our attention back.”

Hari does not attempt to dispel or even downplay the significance of the obvious candidate responsible for our attention crisis namely modern technology: smartphones email social media and more specifically Facebook Google and other tech platforms’ contemporary model of “surveillance capitalism” the term used to describe the capturing and analysis of user data in the service of user manipulation and monetization. Indeed Hari spends large portions of the book emphasizing just how debilitating much of modern technology has been both for individual consumers and for wider society: it has arguably made us (mentally) unhealthier angrier and more politically divided than at any point in modern human history.

But Hari draws a clear distinction between the technology itself and the incentive structures underlying them. It is the latter he notes which constitute the real fundamental problem:

“The arrival of the smartphone would always have increased to some degree the number of distractions in life to be sure but a great deal of the damage to our attention spans is being caused by something more subtle. It’s not the smartphone in and of itself; it is the way the apps on the smartphone and the sites on our laptops are designed […] It’s not just the internet: it’s the way the internet is currently designed—and the incentives for the people designing it. You could keep your phone and your laptop and you could keep your social media accounts—and have much better attention if they were designed around a different set of incentives.”

As is well known the current incentive structures of platforms such as YouTube Facebook and TikTok aim to optimize things like time spent on a given platform number of clicks and number of advertisements seen. Their skilful efforts to maximize our use of the platforms are clearly a large part of why we’re so often incapable of removing our dazed stare from our smartphones’ screens. At one point in Stolen Focus Hari interviews Israeli American tech designer Nir Eyal the author of a book called Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life. Eyal himself recommends individualist solutions to the attention problem showing people tips for getting their tech addictions under control and encouraging a “personal responsibility” approach to smartphone use. But Hari points out that Eyal is also the author of a book called Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products which Eyal calls a “cookbook” containing a “recipe for human behavior.” Eyal describes the techniques of “mind manipulation” used to “create a craving” for a product such as implanting an “internal trigger” in the user’s psychology an uncomfortable emotional state that can only be relieved by the product and that will keep them coming back over and over. As Hari comments:

“In Hooked [Eyal] talks about using ferociously powerful machinery to get us ‘fiendishly hooked’ and in ‘pain’ until we get our next techno-fix. Yet in Indistractable he tells us that when we feel distracted by this machinery we should try gentle personal changes. In the first book he describes big and powerful forces used to hook us; in the second he describes fragile little personal interventions that he says will get us out.”

As Hari indicates the addiction-producing incentives built into tech are far from inevitable. As he puts it:

“[Y]ou could design [technology] … to maximally respect people’s need for sustained attention and to interrupt them as little as possible. You could design the technology not so that it pulls people away from their deeper and more meaningful goals but so that it helps them to achieve them.”

Thus not only is Hari surely right to conclude that “banning surveillance capitalism” is an absolutely necessary step toward reclaiming our attention”—people who are being hacked and deliberately hooked [on tech platforms] can’t focus” as he neatly puts it—but he is also similarly correct in his suggestion that we should want more: we should want technology to be aligned with our interests rather than being merely not-misaligned with them. We should as tech ethicist James Williams has put it want technology not simply to get off our backs but to be actively on our side

Hari also goes beyond technological causes. Indeed much of Stolen Focus’s originality and in fact one of its great strengths is that it does not restrict itself to a discussion of the attention-sapping nature of modern technology but rather emphasizes how other crucial factors like our chronic lack of sleep worsening diets and increasingly polluted cities have also harmed our ability to focus. He shows how these factors work together to create the attention problem. Take Hari’s beautifully succinct explanation for the measurable decrease in children’s attention spans:

“We don’t let [children] play freely; we imprison them in their homes with little to do except interact via screens; and our school system largely deadens and bores them. We feed them food that causes energy crashes contains druglike additives that can make them hyper and doesn’t contain the nutrients they need. We expose them to brain-disrupting chemicals in the atmosphere. It’s not a flaw in them that as a result they are struggling to learn attention. It’s a flaw in the world we built for them.”

The ultimate solutions Hari offers for “healing our attention” are in my view extremely reasonable. Some are proffered at the individual level for instance “pre-committing” to individual tasks getting at least eight hours of sleep every night and taking regular time off social media. Hari himself estimates that as a result of these individual changes to his life his own attention was boosted by about 15-20 percent. However he is clear that such individual solutions can only take you so far; they will not—indeed cannot—constitute a satisfactory long-term solution. On this point he quotes a telling remark from Williams who notes that “digital detoxes” and other individual methods are “not the solution for the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week isn’t the answer to pollution. It might for a short period of time keep at an individual level certain effects at bay. But it’s not sustainable and it doesn’t address the systemic issues.”

Thus Hari believes that it is at the societal level that substantive change must ultimately be made. In particular other than banning surveillance capitalism Hari also suggests introducing a four-day work week (to combat physical and especially mental exhaustion) and encouraging children to play freely from the very earliest stages of childhood. Moreover he makes a persuasive point about how in the absence of a resolution to our attention crisis a host of our societal problems will likely remain including (but not limited to) the climate crisis and the rise in authoritarianism around the world:

“Solving big problems requires the sustained focus of many people over many years. Democracy requires the ability of a population to pay attention long enough to identify real problems distinguish them from fantasies come up with solutions and hold their leaders accountable if they fail to deliver them. If we lose that we lose our ability to have a fully functioning society. … People who can’t focus will be more drawn to simplistic authoritarian solutions—and less likely to see clearly when they fail.”

Or to quote Williams: “In order to do anything that matters we must first be able to give attention to the things that matter.” Indeed I would be tempted to go further still: to the extent that we are unable to focus we are plausibly unable to meaningfully exist.

One central inescapable fact remains: for huge numbers of people smartphones are having a seriously deleterious impact across many aspects of their lives. Not only are they causing mental or physical illness but by users’ own admission they are addictive and seem to have radically skewed how people spend their time and their conception of what they should consider important in life. But if we conclude—as I think we should—that the costs of smartphone use outweigh the benefits an obvious question arises: what should we do?

We can answer that question at both the individual and the societal level. At the individual level the simplest response—which I personally would recommend—would be to get rid of your smartphone. Simple “flip” phones are far less distracting and typically also far cheaper than your average smartphone—and what’s more they still allow you to call and text your loved ones. Other useful suggestions for minimizing your smartphone use include changing your screen to grayscale downloading ad blocking software and even—in the most extreme cases—buying a phone timer “lock box.”

Such individual solutions however will not—indeed cannot—constitute a satisfactory long-term solution to the problem because the devices in question are being designed specifically to overcome human willpower. As Williams remarked in his 2018 book Stand Out of Our Light: Freedom and Resistance in the Attention Economy:

“What we have … is on one side an entire industry spending billions of dollars trying to capture your attention using the most sophisticated computers in the world and on the other side … your attention. This is … akin to a soldier seeing an army of thousands of tanks and guns advance upon him and running in a bunker for refuge.”

Thus it is at the societal level that we must respond. We can first imagine what the most draconian solutions would look like; for instance regulation of smartphone use in a manner comparable to cigarette use. People could be restricted from using their smartphones except in certain designated areas (comparable to “smoking rooms” at airports). If we followed the cigarette model warning labels and images would be placed on phones (featuring perhaps a helpless child desperately trying to get the attention of their smartphone-addicted parent?) just as some countries place images of dying or deceased smokers on cigarette packets.

Civil libertarians like myself are wary of measures that intrude on freedom like trying to ban smartphones outright. A more sensible response is possible: we—that is activists concerned citizens relevant NGOs etc.—could pressure policymakers and businesses to radically overhaul the perverse incentive structures governing the design of these products’ software: those designs which are specifically designed to “hook” the user to the product through the use of features like randomized variable rewards (essentially the same process underlying slot machines) as a means of optimizing metrics like time spent on a given platform number of clicks number of advertisements seen etc. A different set of incentives needn’t have such a deleterious effect on us. More specifically these designs and underlying incentive structures could be redesigned so as to align more with users’ actual interests and concerns (which might include things like reading more learning a new language or fostering genuinely meaningful i.e. mostly offline interactions with friends and family members). To quote Williams again: “No one wakes up in the morning and thinks ‘How much time could I possibly spend on social media today?’”

In the absence of any such societal response however the onus will be on each individual separately to determine for him or herself what they should do. It is not easy. Anyone uncomfortable with their phone addiction must fight a difficult fight to free themselves from it. But in addition to trying to bring our own personal habits in line with our true values and desires those of us who believe the social effects are seriously damaging have a responsibility to try to convey our position effectively to those who disagree. We need to make the case persuasively that the increases in convenience and our occasional use of smartphones to (meaningfully) connect with people are absolutely not worth the cost of addiction depression and perhaps most importantly a fundamental rewiring of what makes us human.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vc29jaWFsLWNoYW5nZS9tb2JpbGUtaG9tZXPSATRodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVldGhpbmsuY29tL3NvY2lldHkvbW9iaWxlLWhvbWVzP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Debunking stereotypes about mobile homes could make them a new face of affordable housing,"When you hear the words “trailer park” or “mobile home park” what comes to mind? Crime? Poverty? Vulnerability to natural disasters? These negative images reflect the stigma reinforced by popular culture that many U.S. residents assign to manufactured home parks – the official name for these dwellings under federal standards adopted in 1976.

Over 20 million Americans live in manufactured housing – more than in public housing and federally subsidized rental housing combined. Yet many people including urban planners and affordable housing researchers see manufactured housing parks as problems. In contrast we see them as part of the solution to housing crises.

We are urban planning scholars who study climate vulnerability community economic development and equity in urban land use. Our research suggests that misguided stereotypes blind scholars and policymakers to the possibility that mobile homes can help address the affordable housing crisis and climate change. Here are some misperceptions about this widespread form of housing.

Building more #manufacturedhousing can be a huge part of solving the affordable #HousingCrisis.https://t.co/72HoPnfhTf — Family Promise (@fpnational) July 5 2022

Stereotype 1: Manufactured housing is shoddy

Many people think manufactured homes are poorly built even though these structures unlike site-built houses have had to meet federal safety standards since 1976. These safety standards have been periodically updated often in response to disasters. Today new well-installed factory-built homes are comparable to site-built homes when it comes to standing up to wind fire and other disaster threats.

Compared to homes built on-site manufactured housing costs half as much per square foot – partly because it’s easier more predictable and cheaper to build homes in factories. Many quality problems associated with manufactured housing arise from home installation park maintenance and infrastructure issues. No matter how well-built homes are residents can suffer if they are installed on unstable foundations or if park owners allow water sewer or power utility infrastructure to crumble.

Stereotype 2: Manufactured housing parks are always exploitative

While many manufactured housing residents own their homes they may not own the land the homes sit on. This can leave them at the mercy of predatory park owners and investors. Moving manufactured homes is difficult and expensive despite the “mobile” label so residents of manufactured home parks can’t easily relocate when park owners allow conditions to deteriorate raise rents or evict residents.

But there are alternatives. Residents at over 1000 manufactured housing parks in the U.S. have jointly bought their land creating Resident Owned Communities.

This cooperative model gives residents control over their homes and neighborhoods. Resident-owned parks preserve affordability and help residents address their own problems including vulnerability to climate-driven disasters.

Stereotype 3: Manufactured housing parks aren’t urban or dense

Manufactured home parks are often dismissed as rural and low-density and therefore irrelevant to urban housing needs. However 61% of all manufactured housing is located in a metro area and 8% is in urban centers.

The density of these communities typically eight to 15 homes per acre is often greater than nearby neighborhoods. In Houston for example many manufactured housing parks are located in suburban areas close to the central business district. If anything local zoning in many cities limits the density of manufactured housing parks.

Stereotype 4: Manufactured housing parks are uniquely disconnected

Critics often assert that manufactured housing parks are disconnected from surrounding neighborhoods. In reality this pattern applies to most U.S. residential neighborhoods built since World War II including gated communities and cul-de-sacs. Residents of these communities value the privacy safety and neighborhood cohesion their street patterns provide.

Biased local zoning regulations also frequently reinforce manufactured housing parks’ isolation by requiring them to be separated and hidden behind tall privacy fencing. Where fragmented street networks create problems for residents like reduced walkability they can be retrofitted by reconnecting streets.

The real challenges

While these stereotypes often don’t reflect reality manufactured housing communities face real challenges.

Local governments and park owners often are eager to convert parks to what they describe as “higher and better uses” which frequently means evicting residents for commercial development or more expensive housing. Private equity investors pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are buying up manufactured housing parks which they view as reliably profitable investments. When owners redevelop parks they can evict residents with little recourse.

Residents of manufactured home parks are also increasingly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Biased zoning rules have forced many of these communities to locate on less desirable land including flood-prone sites industrial areas and highway fringes. In a 2021 review we found that 22% of manufactured housing parks across nine states were located within current 100-year floodplains – zones with a 1% chance of flooding every year.

Manufactured housing is especially common in hurricane-prone regions like Florida Louisiana and Texas. While updated building standards have substantially improved safety increasingly ferocious storms still pose a real threat.

Aging manufactured home park infrastructure including sewer water and electricity systems is highly vulnerable to extreme heat wind drought flooding and wildfires. And since residents typically have lower incomes they have fewer resources to respond when extreme events strike.

Manufactured housing resilience and justice

With economic political and technical support evidence shows that manufactured housing can overcome these challenges.

To date 20 states have adopted laws that help residents purchase the manufactured home parks where they live. These policies have helped ROC USA a nonprofit social venture create a network of over 280 cooperatively owned limited-equity resident-owned communities that are home to over 18000 households.

ROC USA provides low-cost loans to resident cooperatives to buy land and make needed capital improvements such as upgrading water sewer and electric systems. Their network of regional housing experts then works with communities for at least a decade to develop and sustain their ability to manage their parks.

Over three decades no ROC USA community has ever defaulted on a loan or sold their park. A growing number have adopted climate-responsive measures such as building storm shelters and community centers upgrading drainage infrastructure and providing emergency post-storm tree clearance and other forms of mutual aid. Other resident-owned communities are investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs for their residents.

Policymakers are paying attention. The Biden administration’s 2022 housing plan includes extensive support for manufactured housing parks.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for increasing state funding to preserve manufactured housing parks as affordable housing. The U.S. Department of Energy recently adopted more ambitious efficiency standards to reduce energy costs for residents of manufactured housing.

In our view these efforts should be coupled with legislation that protects manufactured housing park tenants and expands the limited-equity ROC model.

Especially when compared to some slab phones on the market...

Let's take a look…





Galaxy Z Flip 4: Is it as compact as you really need it to be?

On the contrary the Galaxy Z Flip 4's primary focus seems to be pocketability . While it's certainly one of the most pocketable phones around I'd argue its overall volume would still be more noticeable when in your pocket compared to something like a mini iPhone or even the compactness factor.



The Z Flip 4 (187g) is also significantly heavier compared to other compact phones like the Asus Zenfone 9 (169g) Samsung's own Galaxy S22 (167g) and especially the iPhone 13 mini (141g). In my experience of switching from a Pixel 6 Pro to an iPhone 13 mini I could say that wight plays a big role when it comes to portability pocketability and prolonged one-handed use.



The Galaxy Flip 4 is still too expensive for a phone with (almost) zero flagship features and a niche-ish audience



Now despite being much less technically impressive than the Fold the Flip is by far the most popular foldable phone on the market if we look at Sure we’re yet to see a rollable phone that’s ready for sale but despite that it feels to me like the Flip form-factor is more likely to stick around while the Fold might be a transitional product before we get something better - whatever that something turns out to be. Like punch-hole cameras and under-display cameras.However this doesn't mean that it's and you realize that when you put it next to an iPhone 13 mini which is a phone that's designed to be light compact and used with one handOn the contrary the Galaxy Z Flip 4's primary focus seems to be.

In my experience of switching from a Pixel 6 Pro to an iPhone 13 mini I could say that wight plays a big role when it comes to portability pocketability and prolonged one-handed use.Now despite being much less technically impressive than the Fold the Flip is by far the most popular foldable phone on the market if we look at sales figures  and make no mistake - pricing has a lot to do with that. Compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 4 which will start at $1800 in the US the Flip 4 looks sensibly priced at ""only"" $1000. However that's very far from making it ""affordable"".









This time around both the Fold 4 and the Flip 4 will actually be getting more expensive in some markets outside the US like in the UK where Samsung's new foldables will cost £50 more compared to their predecessors. Inflation might be to blame although the price hike does feel a bit unfair to British buyers given the fact that prices in the US are staying the same.



The Galaxy Z Flip 4 carries a flagship price but no flagship features?

But the biggest concern with the Flip 4's price seems to be that this seemingly niche-ish device that's compact only when it's in your pocket is that phones like the Galaxy S22 Ultra iPhone 14 Pro and Google Pixel 7 Pro exist or... will exist.



The Flip 4 won't give you the best camera system on the market the biggest battery the fastest charging the best display or the best… anything really. And that's a lot of sacrifices to make for a phone that's just compact in your pocket and still feels like a normal (big) phone when you use it in its unfolded form.



Why wouldn't you get the latest greatest and most durable Samsung phone out there which now costs just as much? Or the best iPhone? Or the best Pixel? Although I do have strong reservations when it comes to recommending Google phones which we haven't tested extensively.



Galaxy Z Flip sales figures are positive but the Flip is still a tough sale: Can Samsung do something about it?



It was a few months ago when we first heard If you recall Samsung's whole self-assigned mission with the Flip and Fold 3 series was to make them more accessible to the masses. The Galaxy Z Flip 5G (effectively the Flip 2) launched at $1400 while the Flip 3 dropped to $1000.This time around both the Fold 4 and the Flip 4 will actually be getting more expensive in some markets outside the US like in the UK where Samsung's new foldables will cost £50 more compared to their predecessors.

Or the best iPhone? Or the best Pixel?It was a few months ago when we first heard rumors about a more budget-oriented Galaxy phone that folds. That makes me question whether Samsung should turn the Flip into a more affordable mid-range device in order to make it more appealing to the masses. Isn't that the entire goal of the Flip at least as of right now anyway?









Perhaps Samsung can make the Galaxy Z Flip A / Galaxy Z Flip Lite out of hard plastic rather than Gorilla Glass; use a mid-range Qualcomm chip and do away with some RAM in order to get the Flip down to $700. This would make it much more appealing to the masses and maybe even make me view it from a different perspective and not as a device that's competing with the Pro and Ultra flagships.



For now and for me the big challenge when it comes to getting fully on board with the flagship-priced and compact Galaxy Z Flip 4 is that it isn't really a flagship phone and it's not all that compact when unfolded. But that’s not to say that there isn’t an audience for it.



In the end not everyone needs a set of flagship cameras and perhaps many will like the fact that unfolding the Flip gives you a properly big screen on which you can enjoy content. In fact I know two people who’ve already asked me about the Flip 3 and will certainly be interested in the new Flip 4 - my mum and aunt. So despite my own reservations the love for the Flip is real.



Speaking of reservations you can pre-order the brand new Galaxy Z Flip 4 now  and enjoy a great deal of discounts including incredible trade-in options. Samsung has some of the best trade-in deals I’ve ever seen. I’ll give them that. By doing so Samsung would also more easily justify going for a Flip that costs… $700 over a Galaxy S23 Ultra which will be way more expensive. For the record Samsung isn't expected to bring a ""budget foldable"" to the market until at least 2024-2025 at least according to rumors . That might be because making a foldable phone isn't very cheap to begin with.Perhaps Samsung can make the Galaxy Z Flip A / Galaxy Z Flip Lite out of hard plastic rather than Gorilla Glass; use a mid-range Qualcomm chip and do away with some RAM in order to get the Flip down to $700.

After a series of high-res leaks and tons of rumors the brand new Galaxy Z Flip 4 has finally launched now (alongside its bigger brother the Fold 4). In case this is the first story about the Flip 4 that you've come across not much has changed compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 3.As it stands we still need to do some more testing before we're ready to deliver our full review but my guess would be that the biggest improvement to the Galaxy Z Flip 4 will be in the area of battery life. That'd be thanks to the more efficient Snapdragon 8+ Gen1 chipset and the slightly bigger 3700mah cell (vs 3300mah on the Flip 3). That might not seem like much but it might help the Flip 4 get to you through a full day of use - something that the Flip 3 struggled to do.The rest of the changes to the Flip 4 are small refinements over the previous generation but won't necessarily make the experience of using the Flip any different. You can find out more in our Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 Hands-on Review What I'd like to focus on in this story are a fewsuch as my opinion that the Galaxy Z Flip 4 is the foldable phone that makes more sense (compared to the Fold 4) but still doesn't seem to be as good of a value and as compact and as affordable as it's supposed to be.To make one thing clear from a long-term perspective the Galaxy Z Flip 4 or clamshell foldables as a whole make more sense than the Fold 4 or foldable mini tablets which might eventually be replaced by something more practical like rollable phones."

Vanguard’s active mutual funds had their bloodiest first half ever data indicates even as its passive products enjoyed inflows.

Investors pulled $54.3bn from the firm’s 71 active mutual funds during the first six months of 2022 the most of any fund complex according to Morningstar Direct and the worst it has ever recorded on its database which goes back to 1993. Vanguard active mutual funds had $1.2tn in assets at the end of June a huge increase on the $77bn such vehicles held in 1993.

Around half of the manager’s first-half outflows came out of five mutual funds the database shows including from the $46bn International Bond Index Fund which shed $24.1bn and the $73.4bn Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt Fund which leaked $9.93bn.

Vanguard’s passive mutual funds which had $3.2tn in assets as of June 30 garnered $3.1bn in net inflows during the first half according to Morningstar Direct and its $1.8tn ETF line added $103.2bn during the period.

This article was previously published by Ignites a title owned by the FT Group.

Across all its US products — which include ETFs mutual funds collective investment trusts and stable value funds — the firm pulled in $77.1bn in net inflows during the first half according to data provided by the company.

“Vanguard has some of the biggest active funds out there so you would expect that just on a plain dollar basis they would have some of the biggest outflows” said Daniel Wiener chair of Adviser Investments and editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors.

Only American Funds and Fidelity have more assets in active mutual funds according to Morningstar.

Another factor that may have played a role in the net outflows from Vanguard’s active funds is the fact that there is a limited opportunity for new flows to come in said Alec Lucas a strategist on Morningstar’s manager research team. Vanguard’s $64bn Primecap Funds for example has been largely closed off to new investors. “The most attractive options in this suite of actively managed funds have limited to no availability for new flows” Lucas said.

A Vanguard spokesperson declined to comment.

Industry-wide active mutual funds recorded redemptions of $454.2bn during the first half Morningstar data shows. Only five of the 50 largest providers of actively managed mutual funds recorded net inflows during the first half according to a recent Ignites analysis.

Together the five asset managers which suffered the greatest outflows in descending order — Vanguard Fidelity Pimco Franklin Templeton and T Rowe Price — recorded $164.6bn in net redemptions during the six-month period according to Morningstar.

Fidelity which had $1.2tn in active mutual funds at the end of June recorded $35.5bn in net outflows from its active funds during the first half Morningstar’s data shows. Nearly all of those flows $31.3bn came out of the Boston-based firm’s US equity funds which account for more than 51 per cent of its total net assets in active mutual funds.

“Only actively managed funds offer investors the opportunity to outperform the market over time while most index funds underperform the market net of fees” a Fidelity spokesperson said. “We also believe that investors want access to a diverse set of investment styles capabilities and low-cost investment vehicles.”

Fidelity’s passive mutual funds which had $876bn in assets as of June 30 added $50.5bn in net inflows during the first half according to Morningstar. Its $28.8bn ETF line meanwhile added $1.2bn.

T. Rowe Price had $22.7bn in net outflows from its active mutual funds in the first half but added $131mn to its suite of ETFs which are actively managed strategies. The firm reported $7bn in assets shifting to from mutual funds to other vehicles such as collective investment trusts during the period.

Instacart filed paperwork to go public earlier this year and while there was no timeline for it to happen The Wall Street Journal recently said the third-party delivery app was looking for its initial public offering to occur before the end of the year.

While there are headwinds to face in going public Instacart was reportedly profitable in the second quarter on a GAAP basis something most third-party delivery stocks have found difficult to do on a regular basis. Yet its peers have not lived up to their pre-public debut hype and there are doubts about Instacart's own valuation.

Although Instacart was once the market leader in grocery delivery by far let's see whether it can still deliver the goods for investors if it goes public or if you should steer clear of a potential car wreck.

Market devaluation

This is a difficult market to go public in. Data from FactSet says there was $317 billion raised by 1073 companies IPOing in the first half of 2021 but only 92 companies have IPO'd over the first six months this year raising just under $9 billion.

Instacart itself is having difficulty coming up with a valuation that could be satisfactory to the market with Bloomberg reporting the delivery service slashed its own estimates this past May from $39 billion to $24 billion -- a 38% drop but not enough to please its investors.

Capital Group went even further and cut its valuation of the delivery app to just $14.7 billion or $45.84 per share down from $119.96 per share in March. Fidelity Investments cut its valuation to $48.43 per share at the end of May a 25% devaluation from its $64.85 per share price applied just a month earlier.

T. Rowe Price Group another investor still has a $96 per share valuation that it set in March. These investor groups bought shares in Instacart through private placements over the past few years.

Slowing growth

Instacart isn't alone in getting thrashed by the market. Uber Technologies (UBER -1.38%) is down 26% so far in 2022 while DoorDash (DASH -1.15%) has seen its stock cut in half. And JustEatTakeaway.com (TKAY.F 0.91%) which owns Grubhub has lost nearly three-quarters of its value this year.

It's because grocery delivery growth is slowing. Market researchers at Brick Meets Click e-grocery dropped about 13% from the first tto second quarter this year.

While inflation higher energy costs and rising interest rates are taking a toll on consumers delivery actually represents a somewhat larger percentage of the total sales because retailers are providing more ways to receive their orders. It's a problem for services like Instacart as the field is a crowded one.

That helps explain why its growth has slowed after the boom of the early pandemic era. According to Bloomberg's Second Measure Instacart's year-over-year sales growth has steadily declined every single quarter since the first quarter of 2021 as average sales per customer have fallen even though they remain above pre-pandemic levels.

No room to move

It's hard to recommend the Instacart IPO. The IPO market is not favorable right now so there will be a lot of money left on the table and because even its internal valuations are so elusive it's possible investors will be burned right out of the gate.

Because grocery delivery growth is so anemic Instacart (and its rivals) have had to resort to branching out into other areas such as launching Instacart Platform to give retailers a suite of tools and services. It also delved deeper into advertising allowing other consumer product brands to market their products but at a time when advertisers are reining in their spending.

Instacart has also launched a line of clothing and accessories as if someone would want to be a walking billboard for a food delivery app.

While anything can change by the time Instacart finally lists its shares an IPO for the food delivery stock right now looks like one that investors should avoid at all costs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vY2FwaXRhbC5jb20vZmFjZWJvb2stc2hhcmVob2xkZXItd2hvLW93bnMtdGhlLW1vc3QtbWV0YS1zdG9ja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook Shareholders | Who Owns The Most META Stock?,"Who are the biggest Meta Platforms shareholders? – Photo: rafapress / Shutterstock

In October 2021 the parent company of the world’s most popular social media platform decided to change its name from Facebook (FB) to Meta Platforms (META) as part of an ongoing shift to the metaverse.

As a result the corporation created a new business unit called the “Reality Labs” that will be in charge of developing this virtual realm.

META stock shed 62% of its value in 2022 as the compnay grappled with poor financial performance and macro woes. It seems that some of Facebook’s backers have fled the scene in fear that this pivot could threaten to derail the firm’s financial performance in the future.

Who are Facebook shareholders at the moment and why should investors care? In this article we share the details about who owns the most shares of Facebook and what influence they might have on the future of the business.

What is Meta Platforms (META)?

Meta Platforms is the name of the company that was formerly known as Facebook. Founded in 2004 by a group of Harvard students including its current CEO Mark Zuckerberg after they created a social app called The Facebook.

Since then Facebook has grown to become the world’s largest social media platform with approximately 2.9 billion monthly active users. In addition the parent company acquired two widely successful mobile apps Instagram and WhatsApp whose results are now being reported under the segment Family of Apps.

As per the latest quarterly report Meta Platforms’ Family of Apps had a combined monthly active people (MAP) of 3.65 billion – almost half of the world’s population.

On 28 October last year Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms. The new name is considered to be a better reflection of the business’s aim to become a leading player in the up-and-coming metaverse industry. The ticker symbol assigned to the company’s Class A common shares was changed from FB to META.

In 2022 Meta Platforms generated a revenue of over 116 billion U.S. dollars a slight decrease on the previous year. The majority of Meta’s profits come from its advertising revenue which amounted to 113.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. Meta Platforms employs over 80000 people.

The groups share price rose in February when it beat analysts estimates for its Q4 earnings release with earning per share coming in at $1.76 and revenue at $32.17bn vs $31.53bn expected according to Refinitiv.

Facebook biggest shareholders: What is Mark Zuckerberg’s stake?

Who are the stakeholders of Facebook? According to Meta Platform’s latest annual report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Mark Zukerberg owns over 800000 Class A Shares and over 300000000 Class B Shares. The next biggest share holders are the groups CFO Susan Li and Chief Product Officer Christopher K. Cox.

3258 stockholders of record held the company’s Class A common stock by the end of December 2022.

Other 5% shareholders inculde BlackRock FMR LLC and Vanguard.

As of 31 March 2023 Meta had 2215650705 shares of Class A common stock and 350578831 shares of Class B common stock outstanding.

Holders of Class B META shares are entitled to have 10 votes for every share they own while Class A stockholders only have one vote per share. These votes can be cast during any stockholders’ meeting to decide on the company’s affairs.

The annual report also disclosed that there were 2.3 billion Class A common stock of Meta Platforms in circulation by 28 January 2022 along with 412.86 million Class B common stock.

This information is important for Meta Platforms shareholders and prospective investors. All decisions concerning the company’s vision future and strategy will have to be approved by Zuckerberg as he holds the majority of the company’s voting power.

According to data compiled by Refinitiv as of June 2022 other top executive holders of the company’s stock include Michael Todd Schroepfer David Wehner David Fischer Jennifer Newstead and Peter Thiel.

Institutional Facebook shareholders

What happens when you push a small snowball down a hill… And what does this have to do with growing wealthy?

When you push a small snowball down a hill it continuously picks up snow. When it reaches the bottom of the hill it is a giant snow boulder.

The snowball compounds during its travel down the hill. The bigger it gets the more snow it packs on with each revolution. The snowball effect is a metaphor for compounding. It explains how small actions carried out over time can lead to big results.

The Power of The Snowball Effect

Before we discuss how to harness the power of the snowball effect we must understand the power of compounding.

The snowball metaphor visually shows the power of compounding.

“The most powerful force in the world is compound interest”

– Attributed to Albert Einstein

Here’s the power of compound interest:

Imagine you invested $1 that compounded at 1% a day. In 5 years your $1 would grow to over $77 million. You would be the richest person in the world by year 7.

Keep in mind that compounding is not a get rich quick scheme. It takes time – and lots of it. There are no investments that compound at 1% a day in the real world.

The stock market has compounded wealth (adjusting for inflation) at ~7.1% a year over the long run. At this rate an investment in the stock market has historically doubled every 10.1 years.

It takes more time to compound wealth in the real world – but that doesn’t make the principles of compounding any less powerful.

Take Warren Buffett as an example. Warren Buffett is worth over $100 billion. Warren Buffett’s wealth comes from the tremendous benefits of the snowball effect through time.

Warren Buffett compounded his wealth through a specific type of investment.

Specifically Buffett invests in:

Shareholder-friendly businesses With strong competitive advantages Trading at fair or better prices

“All there is to investing is picking good stocks at good times and staying with them as long as they remain good companies.”

– Warren Buffett

The next section of this article discusses how to harness the power of the snowball effect by investing in the same type of businesses Warren Buffett does.

Apple has a 0.7% dividend yield

Bank of America has a 2.7% dividend yield

American Express has a 1.4% dividend yield

Chevron has a 3.4% dividend yield

Investing in this type of business is the surest way to benefit from the snowball effect.

The good news is you don’t even have to search for these businesses. There is a list of 44 businesses with 50+ years of consecutive dividend increasescalled the Dividend Kings list.

Nothing says long-term success like 50 or more years of paying rising dividends in a row.

Coca-Cola (one of Buffett’s biggest investments) is a Dividend King. There are many other well-known stocks in the Dividend Kings list including:

Procter & Gamble (PG)

3M (MMM)

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

You may read this and think: “these businesses may have a history of success but isn’t their run over”?

Investors have wasted tremendous sums of money chasing ‘the new hot stock’. You cannot benefit from the snowball effect by investing in businesses that are unproven. Steady dependable results lead to wealth multiplication.

What would happen if you had invested in some of the most well-known Dividend Kings in 1990?

The 7 example businesses below all had 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases by the end of 1990. They were well-known blue-chip stocks in 1990.

It didn’t take a genius to buy and hold them…

But the results speak for themselves. Five examples of the snowball effect in action are below. All examples assume dividends were reinvested.



Example #1: The Coca-Cola Company (KO)

Coca-Cola compounded investor wealth at over 14% a year (including dividends) over the last 30 years. Coca-Cola was the largest soda brand in the United States in 1990… And had a 98 year operating history at the time. It was not a start-up.

Coca-Cola stock ended 1991 at a share price of $4.94 per share adjusted for splits and reinvested dividends. The stock closed at $58.76 per share on December 31st 2021. That means the stock generated annualized returns of 8.6% per year over the 30-year period from 1991-2021.



Example #2: Lowe’s Companies (LOW)

Lowe’s is the second-largest home improvement store in the United States behind only The Home Depot (HD). In 1991 Lowe’s was one of the largest home improvement stores in the United States. It had a dividend history of over 25 consecutive years of increases even then.

Investors in Lowe’s 30 years ago have done very well…

Lowe’s ended 2021 trading at an adjusted price of $256.59. With an adjusted price of $0.76 to end 1991 (accounting for stock splits and reinvested dividends) Lowe’s stock delivered compound annual returns of 21% per year over the past 30 years.

This means a $1000 investment 30 years ago would be worth just over $336000 to begin 2022.

Example #3: Procter & Gamble (PG)

Procter & Gamble was just as well-known in 1990 as it is today. The company has an iconic brand portfolio with names like Tide Bounty Gillette and Charmin (among many others).

The company was founded in 1837. In 1990 Procter & Gamble had been around for 153 years… Not exactly a young company.

Still long-term investors in Procter & Gamble have done well. The stock has produced 30-year annualized total returns of 11.9% a year.

Example #4: Colgate-Palmolive (CL)

Colgate-Palmolive traces its history back to 1806. Both the Colgate and Palmolive brands are easily recognized.

In addition to these brands Colgate-Palmolive owns the Speed Stick Soft Soap and Hill’s brands (among many others).

Colgate-Palmolive has paid dividends since 1893. The company has paid increasing dividends for over 50 consecutive years. In 1991 the company had a streak of 28 consecutive dividend increases.

How did 1991 investors do?

Colgate-Palmolive generated a compound annual returns of 11.5% during this 30-year period.

Example #5: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Johnson & Johnson is currently the largest health care corporation in the world. The company is one of the most stable businesses in the world as well.

This stability is reflected in Johnson & Johnson’s long history of dividend payments to shareholders. This ‘slow and steady’ business has been a boon for shareholders over the long-run.

The company generated compound returns of 11.2% a year for shareholders during this time period.

The company’s low stock price volatility only adds to its appeal. Investors have historically generated excellent returns with Johnson & Johnson stock without as many gut-wrenching ups and downs as compared to other stocks.

Snowball-Effect Stocks For The Next 25 Years

All 5 examples above trounced the market despite being well established businesses with long dividend histories.

But…

What stocks will be the next snowball effect compounders?

There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Anyone holding the serial compounders above should continue to do so.

For those looking to enter into new positions in snowball effect stocks should look for the following:

Above average dividend yield Below average price-to-earnings ratio Long dividend history

The biggest constraint of the 3 is the long dividend history. We will start by selecting only from the Dividend Aristocrats List.

To be a Dividend Aristocrat a stock must have 25+ years of consecutive dividend payments and be in the S&P 500. There are currently 65 stocks that match this criteria.

Out of the 65 Dividend Aristocrats we will screen for:

A dividend yield above the S&P 500’s 1.7% yield A price-to-earnings below the S&P 500’s ratio of 18.8

We will then sort these by expected total return. Total return is the expected earnings-per-share growth rate plus the current dividend yield as well as the net impact of any positive or negative changes in the price-to-earnings multiple.

The 10 highest expected total return Dividend Aristocrats with above market dividend yields and below market price-to-earnings ratios are listed below:

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK): Expected return of 19.9%

V.F. Corp (VFC): Expected return of 17.1%

3M Company (MMM): Expected return of 17.0%

Lowe’s Companies (LOW): Expected return of 15.3%

T. Rowe Price Group (TROW): Expected return of 14.8%

Target Corporation (TGT): Expected return of 14.7%

Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): Expected return of 14.5%

Pentair plc (PNR): Expected return of 14.3%

Franklin Resources (BEN): Expected return of 14.2%

Leggett & Platt (LEG): Expected return of 12.2%

The 10 stocks listed above best match the criteria to best take advantage of the snowball effect.

‘Snowball stocks’ have strong and durable competitive advantages. Evidence of their competitive advantages is seen by their long operating history and consistent dividend increases.

Long-term investing in great businesses with shareholder-friendly managements at fair or better prices will very likely produce compound wealth gains over time.

Remember the snowball effect when choosing your investments.

Nearly four years after launch Red Dead Redemption 2 has achieved powerful sales figures across all platforms. As of June 30 2022 during Take-Two Interactive's Q1 FY23 period Rockstar's cowboy epic has sold 45 million copies combined across digital and physical channels.

Popular Now: Scientists use supercomputer to find out when humanity will perish

These gains are up 1 million units quarter-over-quarter and 7 million units year-over-year and continue RDR2's trends of selling 1 million units between Q4 and Q1 periods. These sales may punctuate a sunsetting of Red Dead franchise content for some years to come; Rockstar has effectively stopped updating Red Dead Online with new meaningful content so it can focus almost exclusively on Grand Theft Auto 6 and RDR2's campaign is practically set in stone with no expansions in sight.

The latter I spent hours attempting to complete but couldn’t. For a while I assumed I was the problem and not the game. I was wrong.

Family Guy Video Game! is a licensed video game that seemed good on paper but was a mess once executed. Regardless there’s plenty to enjoy from the hit TV series’ first video game but you'll need to squint to find it.

Upon Take-Two Interactive getting the rights to Family Guy their subsidiary 2K Games appointed developer High Voltage as the studio that would work on the game version of the beloved animated sitcom. Gamers and fans alike received their first glimpse of the game at E3 2006 with mixed reactions. Those mixed feelings would continue as the Family Guy Video Game! inched closer to its Q4 2006 release date.

Gameplay with Stewie. Source: XTG.

Three's a crowd

In Family Guy Video Game! you follow the plots and play as Stewie Brian and Peter Griffin whose animations are reminiscent of the show but who all have different play styles. Stewie’s levels comprise platforming and shooting. Unfortunately the game's fixed camera made these mechanics challenging and the shooting of enemies quite difficult. Stewie has a lock-on system but with the fixed camera you aren’t sure if you’re shooting or missing the target. In addition a few segments with Stewie are a hassle to get through such as the swimming portions where Stewie only moves at one speed and has imprecise movements.

Another important note: Stewie needs to upgrade his ray gun. Throughout the level there are yellow bolts you can pick up to upgrade your weapon to maximum power.

After the game introduces you to Stewie you move on to Brian. In his missions he sneaks and hides with stealth mechanics to find out why they framed him for impregnating dog race champion Seabreeze. I won’t lie Brian’s sections are tedious. You’re unaware if enemies will spot you and thus his segments become an exercise in trial and error which would feel much simpler if the game didn’t make you restart the segment each time you failed. Not even the invisibility Brian gains during a mini-game can save him.

And speaking of mini-games they’re akin to the couch gags in the game but interactive. Most of the mini-games are jokes from the show and it’s nice to see them in game form but High Voltage could’ve come up with original material for Family Guy Video Game! (each time I spell out the title it makes less sense). The developers have all the original voice cast reprising their roles; they can write new material. Regardless with some of the new material we get it’s only a picture of a stick figure with a button press.

Gameplay with Brian. Source: GameGrin.

Moving on to Peter his levels encompass beat ’em ups where he attacks and pile-drives kids and the elderly only because he believes ’80s character Mr. Belvedere has corrupted everyone in Quahog. Peter beating up innocent people is entertaining but it wears out quickly.

Out of the three characters Peter is the most challenging to use. You aren’t sure when he will register a hit leaving you fighting the enemy until the game decides you should defeat them. Further Peter uses the same fight style and moves throughout the game making the levels tiring and repetitive. Peter has a meter that can expand once he picks up food floating from the ground or beats it out of pedestrians.

The gameplay may be challenging but what about the comedy? Again like the TV show the jokes are hit and miss. One of the notable jokes is a mime covering an invisible wall and the hospital sections have jokes of questionable taste that are otherwise hilarious.

With all that said Family Guy Video Game! may keep you entertained for a few hours or you may chuck your remote at the TV after ten minutes of in-game time.

The worst of them all

Since I played this game as a kid I didn’t realize my disdain for it. I always viewed it as a weird game which sometimes made me laugh but not one of the worst video games ever.

Now that I’m older I realize that Family Guy Video Game! is subpar. The levels are a tad bit enjoyable but become lackluster in parts. The sections with Brian will get on your nerves given the flimsy stealth mechanic. I can say the same about Peter as you’re unsure if your attacks will register. By far Stewie has the best segments in-game. The developers can build on this framework and improve the predecessor for future installments. Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse adds those elements and was a better game for it.

In the end how much you enjoy the show will dictate how much of the game you can tolerate playing. If you're not a fan of the series you’ll be hard-pressed to enjoy the game. Yet if you’re a fan perhaps some amusement will come your way and let you put up with the poorly aging graphics and difficult gameplay mechanics.

The events following Elon Musk announcing his plans to buy Twitter in April have been quite a fiasco. Earlier this month Musk said he was backing out of the US$44 billion bid leading to Twitter suing him over the deal. It surely was an interesting turn of events after Twitter imposed a “poison pill” strategy against Musk’s potential takeover in April. Back then Musk proposed taking the company private at US$54.2 per share which was 38% higher than Twitter’s stock value before the announcement of the plan.

The poison pill move was widely seen as a direct shot across the bow of the Tesla CEO who has been a vocal critic of the social media platform. It stipulates that other shareholders can acquire additional shares at cheaper prices if someone holds beneficial ownership of at least 15 percent of Twitter’s outstanding common stock without the board’s authorization. This would have limited Musk’s access to control through share purchases.

Poison pills are common in the business world to fend off buyout attempts. In 2012 Netflix imposed one to foil the takeover plan of Carl Icahn Founder of Icahn Enterprises after he had purchased a 10% stake in the company. In 2018 Papa John’s Pizza went for a poison pill against John Schnatter the founder of the pizza chain and former chairman. He still owned 30% of the company after resigning his post for using a racial slur during a conference call. Other big corporations like Yahoo and Sotheby’s have also turned to this move as well. Read on to learn more about this strategy and the different types of poison pills.

What is a poison pill?

Devised in 1982 by a mergers and acquisition lawyer in New York Martin Lipton the poison pill also known as the shareholder rights plan is a defense strategy that a company utilizes to prevent or discourage a hostile acquisition. This technique makes the company seem less appealing to prospective acquirers. It became popular in the 70s during a wave of hostile takeovers raiding corporate boards by financiers like T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.

It was first tested in a lawsuit filed by oil firm General American Oil to prevent the attempted takeover by T. Boone Pickens. Lipton advised the company’s Board of Directors to dilute Pickens’ stock purchases by flooding the market with new shares. The board turned down the offer due to concerns over the strategy’s legality and Philips Petroleum bought it out last-minute. It was not after the 1985 landmark ruling of the Delaware Supreme Court in Moran vs. Household International Inc. that the “poison pill” became famous for fighting off unwanted takeover attempts.

Two common types of poison pills

Flip-in poison pill

A flip-in poison pill which Twitter used against Musk’s buyout is a type of tactic which allows all shareholders (except for the acquiring company) to buy additional shares of the target company at a discounted price before the success of a takeover bid.

Although this gives the shareholders immediate profits the new shares will dilute the shares owned by the acquiring firm or investor making it more difficult and costly for the acquirer to gain control. The flip-in tactic is only implemented when the acquirer has acquired at least 20–50% of outstanding shares.

Another company besides Twitter that adopted this was PeopleSoft Inc a company founded by David Duffield and specialized in human resource management systems. In 2004 PeopleSoft implemented the flip-in poison pill tactic against software giant Oracle Corporation allowing new shares to flood the market. It also established a “customer assurance program” under which it promised to reimburse customers up to five times the software costs if the company stopped developing its products after acquisition.

Although PeopleSoft was eventually acquired by Oracle in December 2004 its anti-takeover strategy paid off for its shareholders. Oracle purchased PeopleSoft for US$10.3 billion doubling its initial offer.

Flip-over poison pill

Meanwhile a flip-over poison pill strategy allows existing shareholders of the target company to purchase the acquiring company’s shares at a discount if/when the takeover attempt is successful.

Such a strategy will discourage the acquirers as the shares of the acquiring firm’s existing shareholders become diluted with the purchase. This kind of provision intends to transfer money from the stakeholders of the acquiring firm to those of the target firm.

In most situations the flip-over approach does not completely prevent a takeover. Usually it results in the acquirer canceling its hostile takeover plans to avoid stock dilution and coming up with a more friendly proposal.

Is a poison pill worth it?

While it appears that a poison pill plan can work in deterring hostile coups it is not 100% effective and risk-free. In some cases the strategy can backfire.

When new shares are issued at a discount the stock’s value is altered forcing existing shareholders to purchase more shares in order to keep their original stake. Additionally implementing a poison pill may be both time-consuming and costly in terms of the actual strategy and the company’s reputation. Moreover poison pills can discourage investments from institutional investors like Foreign Direct Investors (FDIs) and Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs).

At the end of the day a poison pill is a last resort strategy that requires thorough consideration. The outcome can be rather complicated such as in the case of Musk’s Twitter buyout deal. Although the plan seems to be off the table now both parties will likely to be in the headlines for a while until the legal battle between them is settled with Twitter reportedly hiring Lipton’s firm to sue Musk.

Amid the ongoing war between Moscow and Kyiv Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday issued a warning by saying that security forces would target any Russian troops who fire at the besieged Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Addressing the nation’s citizens during a night speech Zelenskyy said ""Every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant or shoots under the cover of the plant must understand that he is becoming a special target for our intelligence for our secret service for our army.""

The Ukrainian leader further stated that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is being used by the occupants in an 'extremely cynical' way to intimidate people. In a bid to launch attacks on the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets Russians actually conceal themselves behind the plant he said while accusing Moscow of provoking Ukraine by shelling nuclear power plant land and sending more of their soldiers to threaten Ukraine and the free world.

Russia's nuclear industry would be completely cut off by the new sanctions: Zelenskyy

Speaking about shelling on Zaporizhzhia NPP he said: “Every day of the stay of the Russian contingent on the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and in the neighboring regions of our country increases the radiation threat to Europe so much that even at the peak moments of the confrontation during the Cold War this did not happen.” He even called for more sanctions against Russia and said diplomats from Ukraine and its alliance partners will use every effort to get Russia's nuclear industry completely cut off by the new sanctions.

Zelenskyy appreciated all those who stand up for this approach resist pressure from Russian terrorists and guard Ukraine and the rest of the globe from the nuclear menace posed by the invaders. He has been grateful to all of his energy employees who help the Zaporizhzhia plant and Ukraine's energy infrastructure run smoothly.

Meanwhile according to Petro Kotin the President of the state nuclear corporation Energoatom one operational transmission line presently connects the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to Ukraine's electricity grid. Kotin asserted that if Russian forces disrupt the transmission cable the facility would enter ""blackout mode"" Interfax reported. According to him during the bombardment Russian forces damaged the lines supplying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility with energy posing a ""great threat"" to it. He emphasised that the nuclear plant's link to Ukraine's electrical infrastructure through a single line is extremely hazardous for the facility.

It is important to mention that the high-voltage line was damaged by Russian troops' shelling which forced one of the three operational power units to be disconnected from the network. In a statement posted on Telegram Energoatom warned that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant continues to operate with a potential for radiation and fire safety violations.

The Fiji Pine Limited has set an unprecedented planting target of 7300 hectares for this year.

Chief Executive Vimlesh Kumar says this will be covered by all the six Stations which they aim to achieve by this year.

Kumar says so far they have already planted 2757 hectares.

Article continues after advertisement

He says over the past two years Fiji Pine has revived forest stations engaged several planting gangs and built a new nursery at Drasa in Lautoka to assist their planting operations.

“This nursery was built during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic struck we were significantly affected our sawn timber demand actually crashed but we as a responsible employer decided we will find alternative work for our factory workers.”

Kumar says this has also created around 30 new jobs which the landowners have taken on.

He highlighted the key aspect of having nurseries at the six locations is for them to have a sustainable forest resource.

This is because it takes 25-30 years for pine trees to mature for harvesting.

Since 2011 the pine company has planted a total of 19611 hectares and last year they recorded the highest planting target ever of 4300ha.",,,,,,

Tesla broke ground on a lithium refinery in Texas earlier this year with Governor Greg Abbott in attendance.

Tesla has made over three million cars CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Sunday. Of that total Tesla's Shanghai factory has made one million cars according to the tweet.

""Congrats Giga Shanghai on making millionth car! Total Teslas made now over 3M"" Musk tweeted.

Musk's announcement comes after months of lockdowns and parts shortages in China that threatened Tesla's vehicle production and suggests that Tesla's Shanghai factory is producing a significant number of new vehicles after opening in 2019 and subsequent years of investment.

The total vehicles achievement celebrated by Musk on Sunday comes after Tesla's reported deliveries the closest approximation for sales have been rising in recent quarters. In July Tesla said that it delivered 254695 vehicles in the second quarter a 26.5% rise year-over-year.

But the milestone also highlights how small Tesla is compared to automotive giants. For example Toyota delivered over 10 million vehicles in 2021 alone. Tesla said earlier this year it plans to increase vehicle deliveries by 50% annually.

In addition to its Shanghai plant Tesla produces cars at factories in Fremont California; Austin Texas; and near Berlin in Germany. Musk said in July that the Fremont factory the company's first had made 2 million cars.

In June Musk said he wanted to get the Shanghai plant ""back in the saddle"" and lamented that Tesla's Berlin and Austin factories were ""money furnaces"" losing ""billions of dollars"" because of supply chain and production issues.

Tesla stock is down nearly 25% in 2022 as investors have been reassessing fast-growing companies in the face of inflation and macroeconomic concerns.

Tesla’s Model 3 Long Range configuration is sold out for 2022 according to the company’s Online Design Studio.

The Model 3’s webpage on Tesla’s website has an updated delivery timeframe for each trim level. While the Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Performance configurations are still available and scheduled for deliveries from October to December the Long Range trim level is not available until 2023.

Tesla is feeling considerable demand for the vehicle according to CEO Elon Musk who said the waitlist for this configuration in specific is too long.

Waitlist is too long. Will enable again as we ramp production. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 13 2022

Tesla has battled supply and demand issues for several years only solidifying Musk’s thoughts which are “Tesla has a supply problem not a demand problem.” The automaker has been battling with extended order logs for both the Model 3 and Model Y the company’s two mass-market vehicles. The addition of two new production facilities in Austin Texas and Brandenburg Germany are helping supplement Tesla’s production issues globally. Both factories when fully ramped will add another million units of capacity to Tesla’s manufacturing footprint.

Of course supply issues are not specific to Tesla. While the company has struggled with keeping up with the demand for its vehicles it has done a better job than most of remaining resilient despite difficult market conditions.

Tesla delivered over 254000 electric cars in Q2 with over 238500 units being either Model 3 or Model Ys.

Last year CEO Elon Musk disclosed that Gigafactory Shanghai has now surpassed Fremont Factory in production capacity and Tesla has made the Chinese factory its new main export hub.

Gigafactory Shanghai is a significant success story for Tesla.

The factory went from beginning construction in December 2018 to starting production in December 2019.

Within just two years of starting production it became the biggest/most productive electric vehicle factory in the world by a wide margin.

It finished 2021 with an annualized production rate of over 800000 vehicles it is still growing.

Today CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai has now produced its 1 millionth electric car:

Congrats Giga Shanghai on making millionth car! Total Teslas made now over 3M. pic.twitter.com/2Aee6slCuv — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 14 2022

As Musk highlighted Tesla disclosed just earlier this month that it produced its 3 millionth electric car.

Fremont factory Tesla’s first factory announced that it produced its 2 millionth electric car just a few week prior.

Gigafactory Shanghai’s 1 millionth vehicle came fast but its second millionth vehicle is going to come a lot faster as Tesla recently upgraded the plant to achieve a production rate of 1 million vehicles per year.

The production rate is expected to be achieved later this year.

Gigafactory Shanghai currently only produces Model 3 and Model Y vehicles but the factory is expected to expand to more vehicles next year.

The automaker is aiming to increase its production capacity to 20 million cars per year by the end of the decade.

With the success of Gigafactory Shanghai it’s likely that Tesla will invest more in China to achieve that goal. But in the short term Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas are expected to be the ones adding more production capacity for the automaker.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGF0ZXNsYWFwcC5jb20vdGVzbGEtcmVmZXJlbmNlLzkxMy90ZXNsYS1pbnN1cmFuY2UtYS1sb29rLWF0LWl0cy1jb3N0LWFuZC13aGljaC1zdGF0ZXMtaXQtcy1hdmFpbGFibGUtaW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Insurance: A look at its cost and which states it's available in,"Subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on the latest Tesla news upcoming features and software updates.

You can also read more about how Tesla determines your Safety Score which is used to set your insurance premium.

There are many factors that determine your insurance premium. If you're new to Tesla or haven't shopped around in a few years we recommend getting a free quote from Tesla to see whether Tesla Insurance would save you money.

We've seen scenarios where Tesla Insurance saves someone hundreds of dollars a month but we've also seen it cost significantly more than its competitors.

Big reason to own a Tesla in the states where they offer insurance. next month insurance will be $60/month down from 88 because of a 98 safety score maintained. Best car ever @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/fROEsx3Wfa

According to Tesla ""An average driver could save between 20% to 40% and the safest drivers could save between 30% to 60%.""

Every insurer has different factors to determine their costs and their customers' likelihood of getting into an accident. While Tesla Insurance could save you money it could also cost more than alternatives available in your state.

Tesla Insurance users make monthly payments based on their driving behavior rather than factors typically used by other insurance providers such as credit age gender claim history and driving records.

The insurance premium also factors in the vehicle model the insuree's location and the distance the vehicle is driven.

This data is then used to help determine the driver's insurance premium.

Unlike other insurance products Tesla does not require an additional device to be installed in the vehicle. Instead Tesla uses features already included to determine how often the vehicle is driven and how often the driver follows too closely or stops harshly.

Tesla collects data from the vehicle that helps assess how the vehicle is being driven.

Like other insurance companies there are a variety of plans with varying levels of coverage depending on your needs.

With Tesla Insurance you can view documents billing payment details and make claims all from the Tesla app.

However Tesla Insurance is currently limited to vehicles and Tesla does not offer home insurance or other types of insurance policies.

Tesla Insurance will not only cover Tesla vehicles but also any other vehicles you may own.

If you've recently placed an order for a Tesla you will need to wait until a VIN is assigned before ordering Tesla Insurance.

New and current Tesla owners can purchase an insurance policy in the Tesla app by tapping the profile icon located in the top-right corner and selecting ‘Get Tesla Insurance.’

Tesla Insurance is currently available to Tesla owners in the following states:

The service is currently only available in select U.S. states but it continues to expand to additional states. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says it will also expand to Canada in the future.

It also puts you in control since your insurance premium is in part based on your driving habits.

Tesla has a unique understanding of its vehicles technology safety features and repair costs which help eliminate some fees associated with traditional insurance carriers. Tesla Insurance provides a convenient monthly payment and the ability to manage claims and coverage directly through the Tesla app.

These vehicles will receive access to 2024.8 features such as one-time charge limits ultra-wideband phone key support for the new Model S and Model X and various undocumented changes such as updated turn signal icons new WiFi and Bluetooth menus and more.

For vehicles already on FSD v12 with update 2024.3.25  they’re also eligible for this update which won’t include any improvements to FSD but it’ll include the vast amount of new features in update 2024.14 as well as the features that were on update 2024.8 that they’re skipping over.

The rollout has just started so in typical Tesla fashion it'll slowly roll out to more and more vehicles. 2024.14.6 has so far only been released in the U.S. and appears to focus on getting users onto FSD v12. It's currently available to about 1% of the Tesla fleet. Keep a close eye on our 2024.14.6 rollout statistics page to see when new waves go out.

FSD v12 came with a free one-month trial which started going out last month however vehicles on 2024.8.x weren’t eligible for FSD v12 and therefore weren’t eligible for the free trial. With update 2024.14.6 these vehicles will finally be eligible for FSD v12 and should receive their one-month trial of the software.

FSD v12 was previously based on branch 2024.3 and since Tesla doesn't allow vehicles to roll back in software versions it meant that FSD v12 was only available to vehicles on update 2024.2 or older. This became an issue for vehicles already on update 2024.8.x which included FSD v11.

Tesla has finally issued an update that will give owners on Tesla update 2024.8.x access to FSD v12. Yesterday Tesla released update 2024.14.6  which includes FSD v12.3.6 the latest version of FSD. FSD v12 is also available on update 2024.14.5 however this release appears to have stopped going out. FSD v12.3.6 is the same version that FSD owners have with update 2024.3.25 .

The latest Tesla update 2024.14 is full of exciting features including a fresh design an updated media player full-screen visualizations and so much more. This number of features in this update rivals holiday updates when Tesla usually releases the biggest features of the year.

Below you’ll find photos and videos of each of the major new features in this Tesla update.

High Fidelity Autopark

With update 2024.14.5 we're seeing the Park Assist Upgrade which creates 3D versions of the vehicle’s environment in real-time added to vehicles with ultrasonic sensors (USS) for the first time.

Vehicles without USS received this feature as part of the 2023 holiday update.

Parked Visualization

One of the biggest upgrades of Tesla OS v12 is the new visuals while parked. This feature is available on the Model 3 and Model Y with the AMD-powered infotainment center.

While parked the vehicle is displayed beautifully front and center while also displaying a snippet of the map in the top right corner. At the bottom of the screen you have the ‘Navigate To’ module and the media player.

New Media Player

Tesla says the new media player is also part of the visual upgrade in v12 and therefore will only be available on AMD vehicles however we think it may become available on Intel-based vehicles in the future.

The new media player makes commonly used actions easily accessible instead of having to expand the media player. Options such as shuffle repeat and search are now one tap away instead of having to expand the media player to access these features.

The new media player is a vast improvement. It now features a more obvious progress bar and a translucent background letting the vehicle visualizations shine through. For a full run-down of the new media player including its new minimized version and a video of the player in action check out our in-depth look at Tesla’s new audio player.

Full-Screen Visualization

Full-screen visualizations are no longer tied to FSD and are now available outside of North America for the time. The visualizations themselves are also improved but don’t display the full plethora of visualizations available with FSD. More vehicles are now visualized and additional features such as turn signals are now displayed.

The full-screen visualization view which is accessible by dragging the edge of the visualization to the right offers several improvements over the FSD version available in North America. The new media player and navigate to box will now always be present centered on the screen. A small view of the navigation maps is also displayed in the corner similar to the visualization while parked.

Although full-screen visualizations are available on Intel-based vehicles with FSD in North America Tesla marked this feature as AMD Ryzen-specific although that could change in the future.

Here’s a look at the updated driving visualizations that will come standard with Basic Autopilot on every Tesla after the spring update! 👀😎



Absolutely mindblowing! 🤯@tesla @elonmusk @WholeMarsBlog pic.twitter.com/TMmgXdXLVG — Dominic BRNKMN (@DominicBRNKMN) May 8 2024

Audible

Tesla has added the Audible audiobook service with update 2024.14. The media player has useful buttons to skip forward and back 15 seconds as well as adjust the playback speed. Tesla is also expected to launch Amazon Music in the future.

Hands-free Trunk

A pleasant surprise in this update was the ability to open your trunk hands-free. The feature works by having you stand directly behind the vehicle for a couple of seconds the vehicle will then sound chimes as a warning before opening the trunk for you.

The feature takes advantage of the newer ultrawide band (UWB) protocol which allows for low energy and extremely high precision location tracking. With UWB Tesla can accurately tell where the person is in relation to the vehicle and how much they’re moving. The only vehicles that include ultrawide band are the redesigned versions of the Model S and Model X the new Model 3 and the Cybertruck however the feature hasn't been implemented in the Cybertruck in this update.

The video below shows how the hands-free trunk works and tests it out in a variety of cases.

Preview of Sentry Mode

Another long-awaited feature is the ability to view Sentry Mode footage from your phone. In update 2024.14 Tesla will now send you a notification whenever there is a Sentry Mode event. Attached to the notification and accessible through the app is a short video clip of the Sentry Mode event.

Trip Progress

The trip progress bar sees a nice improvement that was previously available in China. Not only can you now see a visual representation of your trip's progress but the timeline of the trip is also color-coded to show you traffic density along your trip.

This is useful to let you know about potential traffic later on on your trip. The entire module has also been refreshed to have a more modern design. Some information has been moved around such as your ETA and distance to your destination are now the two bits of information at the top of the module.

Wiper Controls

Tesla automatic wiper controls have always been problematic but Tesla is at least now giving us more intuitive wiper controls that let you easily switch the wiper speed.

After this update there are two new ways to change the wiper speed. You can press the wiper button on the left stalk or the wiper button on the new Model 3 and then use the left scroll wheel to scroll up and down to adjust the wiper speed. This was available before but previously required you to tilt the scroll wheel left and right.

You can now also tap the wiper button on the stalk multiple times to go up to the next speed.

Full-Screen Browser

A small but very useful feature that is buried in the release notes is the internet browser's new ""full screen"" button. This new feature is only available while you're parked but it gives you the ability to easily view any website full-screen. This is especially useful when streaming video in your vehicle while parked and not being limited to the choices in Tesla’s Theater app.

Tesla update 2024.14 includes the ability to make the browser full screen.

Rear Screen Updates

The rear screen is also receiving a couple of upgrades. The first is that there will now be a status bar along the top of the screen that displays the current time temperature and estimated time of arrival to your destination so that rear passengers can easily stay up to date on relevant information.

In addition to this new information Tesla will now turn off the rear screen when there is no one seated in the rear seats helping improve the vehicle's efficiency.

Improved Cybertruck Frunk

The Cybertruck is the first Tesla vehicle to receive an auto closing frunk. While it received some criticism when it was first released around potential dangers when auto closing Tesla is now addressing this issue with this update. The frunk is now a lot more sensitive to objects that may be in the way however as one video shows us you probably shouldn’t put your finger in it.

New Tesla Cybertruck update claims to make the powered frunk safer. This is 2024.14.3



Otherwise known as the spring Tesla update.



I tested this out BEFORE and AFTER the update to see if there really is a big difference.



I was actually shocked. pic.twitter.com/bfiVSY7ShI — Jeremy Judkins (@jeremyjudkins_) May 1 2024

Auto Shift

Auto Shift is getting two upgrades with this update. The first is a redesign to the feature which now makes it more compact leaving additional room for the gear indicator and the media player instead of going from top to bottom on the left side of the screen.

The Model S and Model X are also receiving improvements to the auto shifting functionality. The vehicle will now be able to shift automatically from Drive to Reverse and from Reverse to Drive in some situations instead of just auto shifting out of Park.

This feature is expected to arrive for the new Model 3 and the Cybertruck in the future as well.

Average Speed Zones UI

Average speed zones which are used to control speeds over certain periods of roads are now supported in Teslas as well. In countries where this type of speed limit is used the vehicle will keep track of your average speed and let you know when the average speed zone section started and when it will end.

New Lock Sounds for Exclusive to the Cybertruck

The Cybertruck has received nine exclusive features in this update including new lock sounds that are unique to the vehicle.

To use a lock sound instead of the standard honk when you lock your vehicle go to the Toybox and navigate to Boombox. You can also create your own custom lock sound by putting it on your USB drive. You can browse our huge list of custom lock sounds to find the perfect one.

While far from an in-depth review this is an insightful brief comparison between the 2 vehicles.

Barely over a minute into the video Alex finds out why driving a Tesla is so different – even compared to other quick cars he’s driven before the “Sport” mode acceleration is “mindboggling” as he puts it. The “Chill” mode on the other hand is more gradual.This also plays into customizing the driving experience from acceleration and steering all the way to stopping – which Tesla seems to be great at versus his VolkswagenNow the display is used for pretty much everything with a Tesla (even opening the glove box) so it’s no surprise it’s the main attraction here."

DCM Data Products though a part of a large industrial group operated like a startup from a garage and spawned new firms most notably Hindustan Computers Limited (HCL) founded by Shiv Nadar and others. Narendra Patni who conceived the idea of shipping data conversion work from America to India in what later came to be recognised as offshoring founded Patni Computer Systems which in turn nurtured a group of young programmers led by N R Narayana Murthy. This group broke off and formed Infosys. Azim Premji scion of the Western India Products Limited branched off to form Wipro Information Technology Limited which was incubated at the Indian Institute of Science. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) expanded its business with the Tatas also teaming with Burroughs. All these firms benefited from the vast Indian market which was looking to shift from mainframes and data processing to mini and microcomputers after the exit of IBM in 1978. Software services exports in the form of on-site development also began in a modest way by the end of the 1970s.,,,,,,

This study includes samples of anonymized formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human tissue samples from ovarian carcinomas that were collected under local ethical guidelines with informed consent (as stipulated by the Declaration of Helsinki) and approved by the Ethical Committee from Centro Hospital de São João (CHSJ) (Ref.86/2017) with permission to publish data generated.

Cell culture and tissue sections

All cell lines were cultured in standard conditions (37 °C 5 % v/v CO 2 ) in a humidified incubator and were grown in complete medium (i.e. medium supplemented with 10% FBS) unless in starvation and/or stimulation conditions in which case the medium was supplemented with either a very low percentage of FBS or no FBS at all (referred to as starvation medium).

HaCaT and BJ-hTERT cells were cultured in Dulbecco′s Modified Eagle′s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with GlutaMAX™-I and 10% (v/v) Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (all from Thermo Fischer Scientific). MCF7 cells (ECCAC 86012803) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (EMEM) with additives: 2 mM Ala-Gln 1% Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA) and 10 % (v/v) FBS all from Sigma-Aldrich. AGS cell stable clones (E-cadherin WT and V832M a kind gift from Raquel Seruca University of Porto) were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (all from Sigma-Aldrich) and supplemented for selection with 10 ng/µL blasticidine (Gibco) renewed every 3-4 days. U2OS cells were purchased from ECACC (cat no: 92022711). They were cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 2 mM Ala-Gln (all from Sigma-Aldrich).

For the PDIA3 silencing assay Silencer Select siRNA (ThermoFisher) was used to transfect HaCaT cells seeded at a density of 150.000 cells/ml. Either siPDIA3 (ThermoFisher s6228) (“PDIA3 knock-down” condition) or Silencer™ Select Negative Control No.1 siRNA (“control” condition) were used in a final concentration of 100 nM. Briefly either type of siRNA was used to transfect HaCaT cells for 72 h using siLentFect™ Lipid Reagent for RNAi (BioRad) according to BioRad’s instructions. Afterwards either whole-cell lysate was prepared with LDS sample buffer (ThermoFischer NP0007) for testing of silencing efficiency via Western blot or cells were fixed in 3.7% PFA on ice for IF in situ PLA and MolBoolean staining. For an example of presentation of full scan blots see Supplementary Information.

For the disruption of cell-to-cell adhesion assay (Fig. 5a) HaCaT cells were either stimulated with 2 ng/mL TGF-β1 in DMEM starvation medium (0% FBS) for 48 h with fresh medium replacement after 24 h (“treated” condition) or grown in DMEM starvation medium (0.5% FBS) (“control” condition).

For the Clathrin–PDGFR-β assay as described in ref. 37 BJ-hTERT cells were starved overnight in DMEM starvation medium (0.2% FBS) and then either stimulated with 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB in for 15 min (“treated” condition) or left untreated in the same medium (“control” condition).

Anonymized formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human tissue samples from ovarian carcinomas were collected under local ethical guidelines with informed consent (as stipulated by the Declaration of Helsinki) and approved by the Ethical Committee from Centro Hospital de São João (CHSJ) (Ref.86/2017). Anonymized FFPE tissue blocks for all other tissues were purchased from a commercial biobank (Asteand Biosciences/BioIVT) and used in agreement with the terms and conditions of sale. Glass slides with the tissue sections were deparaffinized by 3 × 3 min washes in xylene (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by one wash in 100% xylene and 99.9% ethanol in 1:1 ratio for 3 min and 2 × 3 min washes with 99.9% ethanol as well as 1 × 3 min 96% ethanol 1 × 3 min 70% ethanol and 1 × 3 min 50% ethanol. The tissue slides were rinsed in deionized water and antigen retrieval was performed with Tris-EDTA pH 9 (DAKO) in a pressure cooker at pressure 2 atm at 95 °C for 40 min.

In situ PLA

All in situ PLA experiments were performed with the Duolink® In Situ Red Starter Kit Mouse/Rabbit (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief PFA-fixed cells on 8-well Nunc™ Lab-Tek™ II CC2™ Chamber Slides (Sigma-Aldrich) or deparaffinized FFPE sections that had undergone antigen retrieval (for details see Cell culture and tissue sections) were encircled with ImmEdge Hydrophobic Barrier PAP Pen (Vector Laboratories) to ensure the reaction mixes in the next steps will cover the cells/tissue. The cells were then permeabilized in 1× TBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 0.2% v/v Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min followed by 2 min wash with 1× TBS. Blocking was done with Odyssey blocking buffer (LiCor) for 1 h in a humidified chamber and afterwards the cells were incubated with either a mixture of two primary antibodies against the respective proteins of interest raised in different hosts (mouse or rabbit) or with either one of these antibodies (to serve as omitting controls). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by 3 × 5 min wash in 1× TBS and an incubation with a mix of the Duolink® In Situ PLA® Probe Anti-Rabbit PLUS Affinity purified Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) and Duolink® In Situ PLA® Probe Anti-Mouse MINUS Affinity purified Donkey anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) (all from Sigma-Aldrich) in the concentrations recommended by Sigma-Aldrich. Next followed hybridization and ligation with the Duolink® Ligation mix and finally RCA and signal detection were performed using the Duolink® In Situ Detection Reagent Red. Nuclei were labeled with Hoechst33342 (1:250 Thermo Fisher Scientific). The slides were then mounted with SlowFade Gold antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and images were acquired with Zeiss AxioImager M2 with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63x NA 1.4 oil objective and deconvolved with Huygens Essential (Scientific Volume Imaging the Netherlands http://svi.nl) using the Deconvolution Wizard option. Quantification and colocalization analyses were performed with the CellProfiler50 software on the deconvolved but otherwise unaltered images.

IF staining

PFA-fixed cells or FFPE tissues (for preparation see Cell culture and tissues) were stained using standard immunofluorescence techniques. Permeabilization was performed as for in situ PLA and subsequently both cells and tissues were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LiCor) for 1 h. After blocking the primary antibodies of interest were diluted in blocking buffer and applied to the slides overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber and afterwards washed in 1× TBS for 3 × 5 min. Next fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies and Hoechst33342 (1:250 Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 1× TBS-Tween-20 wash and mounting with SlowFade Gold antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired with Zeiss AxioImager M2 with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63x NA 1.4 oil objective and then deconvolved with Huygens Essential (Scientific Volume Imaging the Netherlands http://svi.nl) using the Deconvolution Wizard option.

MolBoolean sequence design

All MolBoolean oligonucleotide sequences (Table 1) were designed by hand and tested in Nupack53 (nupack.org) for the formation of secondary structures and hybridization at different concentrations temperatures and salinity.

Table 1 DNA design for MolBoolean Full size table

Padlock probes

We designed padlock probes (see Table 1) as previously described17. Each probe is 99 nt long out of which 25 nt in the 5′ end and 24 nt in the 3′ end are complementary to the MolBoolean arms. Hybridization to the arm will bring the 5′- and 3′ end together and act as a template for ligation. The 5′- and 3′ ends of the padlock probes are joined by a 50 nt linker.

Circle ligation

The circle parts 1 and 2 (Table 1) were ligated by using 0.02 U/μl T4 ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in T4 DNA ligase buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at room temperature. Non-ligated oligonucleotides were removed via digestion with a mixture of 2 U/μl exonuclease I 0.5 U/μl lambda exonuclease and 0.5 U/μl T7 exonuclease (all from New England Biolabs) in 1× exonuclease I reaction buffer (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C overnight followed by heat inactivation of the enzymes at 80 °C for 30 min and subsequent validation by gel electrophoresis.

NHS-ester conjugation of MolBoolean proximity probes

The antibody components of the probes were concentrated to a minimum of 2 μg/μl using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (Sigma-Aldrich). Succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazine (SANH) Crosslinker (Solulink) was added at a 25-molar excess to the antibodies and incubated under gentle agitation for 2 h at room temperature protected from light. Each conjugation reaction underwent a buffer exchange to 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 (Sigma-Aldrich) 150 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich) pH 6 with the use of Zeba Spin Desalting Columns 7 K MWCO (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Activated antibodies were incubated in 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 150 mM NaCl pH 6 with a 3-molar excess of aldehyde-modified arm A (for anti-mouse IgG) or B (for anti-rabbit IgG) and 10 mM aniline (Sigma-Aldrich) as a catalyst. The reactions were incubated protected from light and with gentle agitation for 2.5 h in room temperature before a buffer exchange to 1× PBS (Thermo Fischer Scientific) followed by size-exclusion purification.

oYo-Link conjugation of primary MolBoolean proximity probes

For preparation of MolBoolean probes using direct conjugation of primary antibodies to arm oligonucleotides A and B respectively 100 µg of anti-mouse E-cadherin (AMAb90862 Atlas Antibodies) and 100 µg of anti-rabbit β-catenin (AMAb91209 Atlas Antibodies) primary antibodies (Table 2) in PBS formulation were used. The next steps were performed according to the recommended protocol for oYo-LinkTM conjugation (AlphaThera). In brief 5′-oYo-Link-modified arms A and B (Table 1) were ordered from AlphaThera via the oYo-Link Oligo Custom option and each arm was resuspended in 100 µL of nuclease-free water in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Each antibody was then mixed well with the corresponding arm (1 µg of antibody per 1 µL of oYo-modified arm) centrifuged and subjected to Light-Activated Site-Specific Conjugation (LASIC) under 365 nm black light for 120 min on ice in order to achieve covalent binding of oligo to antibody. Size-exclusion purification followed.

Table 2 Antibodies used for MolBoolean experiments Full size table

Size-exclusion purification

The conjugated probes were purified from unconjugated antibody and oligonucleotide by ÄKTA Pure chromatography (GE Healthcare) using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). Successful purification was confirmed by separating the conjugates on a Novex TBU 10% gel (Life Technologies) at 150 V for 60 min in a water bath pre-heated to 50 °C. DNA was visualized using SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Life Technologies) and protein was visualized using Coomassie brilliant blue stain (Bio-Rad). The gel was imaged on Odyssey Fc with the Image Studio Lite v5.2.5 software (LI-COR Biosciences).

In solution specificity tests

All reagents were diluted to concentrations corresponding to those used in situ in proportion to the reaction volume. Unhybridized MolBoolean oligonucleotides were used as size references (Supplementary Fig. 1 wells 1 through 5 on the gel represent the ligated circle arm A arm B tag A and tag B respectively). To demonstrate the specificity of the nickase we prepared a 2x Digestion Master mix (0.25 U/mL Nt.BsmAI in water and 2x NEBuffer CutSmart (both from New England Biolabs)) and mixed it with circle in a final concentration of 0.1 µM. A quarter of this reaction mix was set aside and the rest was divided into three equal parts to which we added as follows: arm A at a final concentration of 0.2 µM; or arm B at a final concentration of 0.2 µM; or arms A and B at a final concentration of 0.2 µM each. The resulting four digestion reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then at 65 °C for 20 min in order to heat-inactivate Nt.BsmAI according to the manufacturer’s instructions (shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 wells 6 through 9 respectively). Next we proceeded by preparing five ligation reaction mixes on the basis of the digestion mixes from the previous step. For the reaction mix in Supplementary Fig. 1 well 10 we added tag A at a final concentration of 1 µM to the mixture of nicked circle and arm A. In the same way for the reaction mix shown in well 11 we added tag B to the nicked circle and arm B mix. For the mix in lane 12 we combined both tags A and B and added them to the mixture of nicked circle and both arms prepared at the previous step. In addition for the mixture in well 13 we added tag B to the mix of nicked circle and arm A whereas for the mixture in well 14 we added tag A to the mix of nicked circle and arm B. These five reactions (Supplementary Fig. 1 wells 10–14) all had 1x T4 Ligation buffer and 0.05 U/µL of T4 Ligase (both from ThermoFisher) added after hybridization between tags and arms was allowed for 30 min at 37 °C first. After enzyme addition the five samples were incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C to allow for ligation. Next the ligase in the samples was heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 20 min as per the enzyme’s manufacturer’s recommendations. All samples were loaded on a denaturing Novex TBU 10% gel (Life Technologies) after boiling in 50% urea for 5 min at 95 °C and the gel was run at 130 V for 35 min in a 65 °C water bath. DNA was visualized using SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Life Technologies). The gel was imaged on Odyssey Fc with the Image Studio Lite v5.2.5 software (LI-COR Biosciences).

MolBoolean experimental procedure

Cells were seeded in the desired density on 8-well Nunc™ Lab-Tek™ II CC2™ Chamber Slides (Sigma-Aldrich) and treated according to the experimental condition. Fixation was performed with ice-cold 3.7% PFA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min on ice. The chamber slides were dried and stored at −20 °C until use or used fresh. The wells were removed from the slides and subsequently lined with ImmEdge Hydrophobic Barrier PAP Pen (Vector Laboratories). The cells were permeabilized with 1× TBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 0.2% v/v Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min followed by 2 min wash with 1× TBS. Blocking was done either with Odyssey blocking buffer (LiCor) or homemade blocking buffer (2% BSA w/v (Jackson Immunoresearch) in 1× TBS 0.1% Tween (Sigma-Aldrich) 0.02% sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich)) either one supplemented with 2.5 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. The cells were then incubated with pairs of mouse and rabbit primary antibodies against the proteins of interest diluted in either Odyssey blocking buffer or homemade blocking buffer and were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber followed by 3 × 3 min washes in 1× TBS. The primary antibodies used are shown in Table 2. The cells were incubated with 3 μg/mL of each proximity probe (A and B) diluted in either Odyssey blocking buffer or homemade blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber followed by 1 × 3 min wash in 1× TBS 1 M NaCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 0.05% v/v Tween-20 followed by 2 × 3 min wash in 1× TBS 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T). Subsequently the cells were incubated in 1× T4 DNA ligase buffer supplemented with 0.25 mg/mL BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) with 0.05 μM circle for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber followed by 3 × 3 min wash with 1× TBS-T. Afterwards a mix of 0.125 U/μl Nt.BsmAI in 1× NEBuffer CutSmart (New England Biolabs) and 0.25 mg/mL BSA was added for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber followed by 3 × 3 min wash with 1× TBS-T. For the hybridization of the tag oligonucleotides the cells were incubated in 1× TBS 0.25 mg/mL BSA and 0.5 μΜ tag oligonucleotides A and B (Table 1) for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber and ligated in 1× T4 DNA ligase buffer 0.25 mg/mL BSA 0.05 U/µl T4 ligase for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 1 × 3 min wash with 1× TBS 1 M NaCl 0.05% v/v Tween-20 and 1 × 3 min wash with 1× TBS-T. For the RCA the cells were incubated in 1x phi29 polymerase buffer (Monserate) 0.25 mg/mL BSA 1.25 mM dNTPs (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 U/μl phi29 polymerase (Monserate) for 90 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber followed by 2 × 10 min wash with 1× TBS-T and then incubated in 1× TBS 1 M NaCl 0.05% v/v Tween-20 0.25 mg/mL UltraPure Salmon Sperm DNA Solution Hoechst33342 (1:250) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 0.025 μΜ detection oligonucleotides A and B (Table 1) for 30 min at 37 °C in a dark humidified chamber followed by 1 × 10 min wash with 1× TBS 1 M NaCl 1 × 10 min wash with 1x TBS and 1 × 5 min wash with 0.2× TBS in the dark. Slides were mounted with SlowFade Gold antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions and sealed with Menzel Gläser coverglass #1.5 (VWR). During cell and FFPE tissue section imaging at least three images per well or FFPE tissue section were taken in a single focal plane according to the Nyquist criteria. The microscope images were acquired using either a Zeiss AxioImager M2 (Fig. 4 all IF images) or a Leica TCS SP8 X microscope (all other images) using the Zen Blue 2 or the LasX software respectively. The former was used with a 63x/1.4 oil apochromat (Zeiss) objective lens a Hamamatsu C11440 camera and an HXP 120 V (Zeiss) light source for excitation. The latter was used with a water immersion HC PL APO 63x/1.20 NA motCORR CS2 objective lens (Leica) and the Leica White light Laser. Images were deconvolved with Huygens Essential (Scientific Volume Imaging the Netherlands http://svi.nl) using the Deconvolution Wizard option. Quantification and colocalization analyses were performed with the CellProfiler54 software on the deconvolved but otherwise unaltered images. Adjustments of brightness and contrast were then made on figure images for visualization purposes only. Pseudo-coloring was applied to all images; Hoechst33342 Texas Red and Atto647N are depicted in blue magenta and green respectively.

Data analysis

Deconvolved split-channel images in grayscale.tif format were analyzed using the CellProfiler software version 4.1.354. For MolBoolean analysis a pipeline for signal quantification with slight modifications between assays was compiled with the following modules: IdentifyPrimaryObjects IdentifySecondaryObjects EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures IdentifyPrimaryObjects ExpandOrShrinkObjects CombineObjects MaskObjects MeasureObjectIntensity DisplayDensityPlot ClassifyObjects FilterObjects OverlayOutlines SaveImages MeasureImageAreaOccupied RelateObjects ConvertObjectsToImage GrayToColor and ExportToSpreadsheet. First IdentifyPrimaryObjects was used on the nuclear stain channel to identify nuclei based on their diameter measured in pixels and the application of two-class Otsu thresholding. Thereafter IdentifySecondaryObjects was used to identify the cells by means of expanding the nuclei by distance—N by a certain number of pixels set by user. The images with the RCPs were filtered to remove background with a white top-hat filter through the enhance speckles feature in the EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures module and IdentifyPrimaryObjects was used in both filtered images containing RCPs in order to identify the RCPs within a certain diameter (measured in pixels) using two-class Otsu or global manual thresholding. The identified RCPs were then shrunk to a single point in the ExpandOrShrink module and expanded again by distance—B to a certain number of pixels using minimum cross-entropy thresholding so as to better encapsulate the RCPs using the IdentifySecondaryObjects module. The identified expanded RCPs were merged in the CombineObjects module and any signal outside the defined cells was removed through the MaskObjects module in order to avoid inclusion of unspecific background specks or RCPs from cells that have been excluded from the analysis. The intensity of the RCPs in both channels was measured with the MeasureObjectIntensity module and plotted on a density plot through the DisplayDensityPlot module. In the ClassifyObjects module a manually determined threshold based on the density plot was used for the classification of objects where the aim was to avoid background and include the highest intensity signal. In preparation for downstream analysis the manual thresholds for both images were set to zero. The RCPs were then filtered by means of the FilterObjects module based on their classification as protein complex or free protein and the bins of RCPs generated were saved as images with the nuclei outlines overlaid through the SaveImages and OverlayOutlines modules. Thereafter the RCPs were assigned to cells with the RelateObjects module. In order to get a quality control of the segmentation and classification of the RCPs the classified RCPs were shrunk again to a single point through the ExpandOrShrinkObjects module and converted to binary images through the ConvertObjectsToImage module on which the outline of the RCPs was overlaid by means of the OverlayOutlines module. GrayToColor module was used in order to generate a quality control image consisting of the original images with RCPs as well as the reduced to single point RCPs classified to bins of protein complex and free proteins. The color-coded outlines of the RCPs assigned classification were overlaid to the quality control image through the OverlayOutlines module and the generated images were saved through the SaveImages module. The data were thereafter exported to a CSV file with the ExportToSpreadsheet module and were used for downstream analysis in which data were binned by applying angled thresholds based on the intensities of every class of signal (analysis with description and examples is available at Github: https://github.com/pharmbio/molboolean_code55) and statistics. For an example of specific settings that we used for our CellProfiler pipeline see Supplementary Notes.

For in situ PLA analysis a pipeline for signal quantification with slight modifications between assays was compiled with the following modules: IdentifyPrimaryObjects IdentifySecondaryObjects EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures IdentifyPrimaryObjects MaskObjects RelateObjects and ExportToSpreadsheet. First IdentifyPrimaryObjects was used on the nuclear stain channel to identify nuclei based on their diameter measured in pixels and the application of three-class Otsu thresholding. Thereafter IdentifySecondaryObjects was used to identify the cells by means of expanding the nuclei by Distance - N by a certain number of pixels. The images with the RCPs were filtered to remove background with a white top-hat filter through the enhance speckles feature in the EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures module and IdentifyPrimaryObjects was used in the filtered images containing RCPs in order to identify the RCPs within a certain diameter (measured in pixels) using robust background or two-class Otsu thresholding. Thereafter any signal outside the defined cells was removed through the MaskObjects module in order to avoid inclusion of unspecific background specks or RCPs from cells that have been excluded from the analysis and the RCPs were assigned to cells with the RelateObjects module. The data were thereafter exported to a CSV file with the ExportToSpreadsheet module and were used for downstream analysis and calculations (R code is available at https://github.com/pharmbio/molboolean_code55). For an example of specific settings we used for our CellProfiler pipeline see Supplementary Notes.

Data were quantified as number of single- and dual-colored RCPs either recorded per individual cell (in the case of fixed cell stains) or as detected in an image frame (for tissue stains).

Statistics and reproducibility

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation. Statistical differences were analyzed using nonparametric tests two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test for comparison of two groups or Kruskal–Wallis and two-sided Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction for comparison of three or more groups.

Wine Samples collection

Three kinds of commercial fruit wines (blueberry wine B goji berry wine G and hawthorn wine H) purchased from retail stores in China were used for the establishment of HRMS library. All blueberry samples were with an alcohol content of 12% v/v (percent by volume). Three blueberry wines were received from Beiyushidai including blueberry dry wine produced in 2019 (B1) and 2017 (B2) and blueberry semi-dry wine produced in 2019 (B3). A blueberry dry wine (B4) was produced by Shenghua in 2019. Another blueberry dry wine (B5) produced in 2019 was provided by Yicunshanye. Goji berry semi-dry wine (G1) was produced by Ningxiahong in 2019 with an alcohol content of 7% v/v. Four batches of goji berry dry wine (G2-G5) produced by Senmiao in 2017 were with an alcohol content of 11% v/v. G6 was made by our laboratory in 2016 with an alcohol content of 11% v/v. All hawthorn wine samples were semi-dry wines from Shengbali. H1 and H2 produced in 2019 were with an alcohol content of 12% v/v. The other H3-H5 were produced in 2020 with an alcohol content of 13% v/v from Shengbali.

Preparation of the spiked mixture

The direct liquid introduction method was used to determine the mass spectral information of the target compound. The standard mixtures (Mixture 1 with 24 esters Mixture 2 with 6 carbonyl compounds and 8 lactones and 6 acids Mixture 3 with10 high alcohols and 6 furans and 5 pyrazines Mixture 4 with 5 terpenes and 4 benzenes and 4 volatile phenols and 1 sulfide) were prepared to extract. The mother solution of each compound was dissolved in ethanol at higher concentration. Each standard mixtures were mixed by the mother solution of compounds according to the concentrations (Table 1).The standard mixtures were diluted with dichloromethane to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. 1 μL of each mixture was injected. The split mode was applied with a split ratio of 10:1. The liquid injection was performed using the TriPlus RSH autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific Bremen Germany).

Extraction of volatile compounds in wine samples

Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) was used to extract the volatile compounds from fruit wines. 5 mL of wine samples mixed with 1.00 g NaCl and 10 μL of internal standard (1.077 g/L 4-methyl-2-pentanol) were prepared in a 20 mL glass vial. The sample vials were stirred and heated at 60 °C for 30 min. Then the preconditioned fiber (50/30 μm Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS)) was used to absorb the volatile compounds in the headspace of the sample via for 30 min at 60 °C. After absorption the fiber was inserted into the GC injection port for desorbing at 250 °C for 10 min. Two technical replicates were performed for each sample. Automatic headspace solid-phase microextraction was performed on the TriPlus RSH autosampler.

GC-Orbitrap-MS analysis

A Thermo Scientific Trace 1300 gas chromatography equipped with a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (GC-Orbitrap MS Thermo Scientific Bremen Germany) was used for detection. The spiked mixture was performed under the following GC-Orbitrap-MS conditions. A TG-WAXMS 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm (Thermo Scientific Bremen Germany) was used to separate analytes. Helium was used as the carrier gas (1.2 mL/min). The oven temperature program was set as follows: 40 °C held for 5 min then heated to 180 °C at 3 °C/min finally increased from 180 °C to 240 °C at 30 °C/min and hold 15 min. The wine samples were performed under the following GC-Orbitrap-MS conditions. A DB-WAX 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm (J&W Scientific Folsom CA USA) was used to separate the volatile compounds under a 1.2 mL/min flow rate of helium (carrier gas).The oven temperature program was set as follows: 40°C held for 5 min then heated to 180°C at 3 °C /min finally increased from 180 °C to 250 °C at 30 °C/min and hold 10 min.

The Orbitrap-MS operated in full-scan MS acquisition mode (m/z 33–350). The ion source was maintained at 280 °C with an MSD transfer line temperature of 230 °C. Positive ion-electron ionization (EI) was used at 70 electron volts (eV) in Orbitrap-MS.

Identification of the compounds

Retention indices (RI) were calculated from the retention times of C6-C24 n-alkanes under the same chromatographic and mass spectrometric conditions. The high-solution mass spectrums of volatile compounds were collected in different standard mixtures. Then the qualitative determination of target compounds in fruit wines was performed by the match of the retention time and ion fragments in samples and standards.The experimental design and analysis pipeline are shown in Fig. 1."

The Spartan Races at the Johnson Farm and Lynch’s Woods were a big hit with over 6000 competitors coming to Newberry from across the country and overseas and social media was full of comments praising the venue and Newberry. “Beautiful course” said Michael. “Fantastic venue and great city” said Ryan. “The people in Newberry are just as nice as can be” said Jay. Terri said “In six years we’ve never experienced a location as hospitable and genuinely happy to have us.”

The Spartan Race staff was most complimentary of their weekend in Newberry including posting: “Thank you South Carolina. We had a blast.” We hope they come back.

Newberry’s Donnie “Tankman” Bates opened Tankman’s Garage Tavern in the corner of the Newberry Plaza (behind Hardee’s). Nicknamed Tankman by an aunt when he was toddler Donnie served 21 years in the S.C. National Guard as a mechanic and was deployed to Afghanistan and Poland. He also ran the NCO Club hosting events and dinners for his fellow soldiers. Upon retirement from the Guard Donnie is using that experience at his new tavern aiming to provide a new option in Newberry with good food and drinks and live entertainment Thursday-Saturday nights such as a musician karaoke etc. For a recent lunch I had a Philly steak sandwich that was delicious and look forward to going back to try his popular wings. It opens daily at 11 a.m. and is closed on Wednesdays.

Main Street Connections is now open at 1204 Main Street “offering a unique shopping experience for everyone in the family” says Alice Romanstine-Hall who is an owner along with her husband John Hall and Ernest Shealy. In addition to items in the shop they also offer history tours children’s events and more. “Newberry is a well-kept secret and our desire is to share Newberry with everyone locals and tourists” Alice said.

Huddle House held their ribbon-cutting on July 30 and I like its neighborhood-diner feel. Their menu has much variety including a tasty country-fried steak. And Cookout continues to have its engineers develop plans to build in the front of the Tractor Supply parking lot with hopefully final commitment and then construction coming by late fall.

In city projects Israel Brooks Park on Wise Street has new basketball courts and a new playground and they look great. Wells Japanese Garden renovations have received much praise and the project will get its finishing touches soon. The city also recently resurfaced the Oakland Tennis Courts and the basketball courts at Dr. Julian Grant Park and Dr. Ulysses Gallman Park. And the Gully Washer Splash Park is probably the most popular and happiest spot in Newberry County this summer.

So many good things are happening at Newberry College. The first students of the semester are moving in this week in what the college expects will be a large enrollment. Bulldozers are moving off Evans Street with construction underway for the new Nursing and Health Science Center. And Newberry College and NCMH announced a new partnership to establish a new health clinic to adjoin the new nursing building enabling health care students to gain hands-on experience and giving the college community and the public a new clinic. It will be a significant addition to the Newberry community.

Inflation finally slowed in July a shift that could be due in part to declining fuel prices. That in turn appears to have corresponded to a drop in airfares which are down 7.8% in July compared to June according to the latest numbers released this week from the Labor Department.

Flights from San Diego are $230 cheaper on average than the peak they reached in May according to the travel site Hopper. Flights to Hawaii have dropped $154 and a flight to Prague will cost you about $300 less.

""I feel like it went up but now it's going back to like normal prices"" traveler Sharrie Scott said.

Airline ticket prices peaked in May as pent-up pandemic demand filled planes and fuel prices soared. To find a deal Ranada Young and her mom took a ridiculous detour driving more than a hundred miles to save nearly $400. They flew from Eugene Oregon to Burbank California – instead of going from Portland to Los Angeles. However it still cost Young about double the price she paid last year.

""They were close to reasonable at that time they were $400 for the two of us roundtrip"" Young said.

Haley Berg lead economist for Hopper told CBS News that purchasing airfare right now for domestic trips in September and October will cost travelers an average of $238 down 37% from May.

""If you're looking for a deal on airfare now is the sweet spot"" Berg said.

However she expects the average airfare to again top $300 by November and rise steadily higher as people book for the holidays.

""Though prices have fallen from the peak earlier this summer well over $400 they are still relatively high"" Berg said. ""Prices will probably drop a little bit between now and the middle of October. You will want to book your holiday travel by that second week of October.""

Young is already bargain hunting for her next getaway.

""With the prices coming down on airline tickets I'm actually anticipating us traveling some more in the next year than I initially planned in our traveling budget"" Young said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGIuY29tL25ld3MvZG91YmxlLWEtYXJrYW5zYXMtdG9zc2VzLXNlY29uZC1uby1oaXR0ZXItaW4tMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Double-A Arkansas tosses second no-hitter in 2022 | MiLB.com,"Double-A Arkansas’ second no-hitter of the 2022 season was started by a young arm on his way to the Major Leagues. It was finished off by a pair of veterans working their way back up to The Show. No. 24 Mariners prospect Prelander Berroa struck out a career-high 11 over

Double-A Arkansas’ second no-hitter of the 2022 season was started by a young arm on his way to the Major Leagues. It was finished off by a pair of veterans working their way back up to The Show.

No. 24 Mariners prospect Prelander Berroa struck out a career-high 11 over five brilliant innings on Friday against Northwest Arkansas before giving way to Blake Weiman  Jake Haberer and former Major Leaguers Rob Kaminsky and Braden Shipley for one-inning stints each to seal a 6-0 victory.

It was the second time the Travelers held their opponent hitless this year following Connor Jones ’ seven-inning effort on May 26.

“Berroa set the tone in a big way” Travelers pitching coach Sean McGrath said. “We’ve worked the bullpen pretty well all year so most of those guys are in good spots. The nerves were building as the outs counted down but it was really exciting.”

The 22-year-old struck out nine of 10 batters in an untouchable stretch from the second through fifth innings -- the one exception being a walk that was quickly erased on a caught stealing. Acquired from the Giants in May Berroa posted a 2.41 ERA in 13 starts with High-A Everett before his promotion to the Travelers.

“He just attacked the zone relentlessly” McGrath said. “Obviously he has an incredible fastball and a tremendous slider. When that guy has a really good game plan and is going one pitch at a time you see dominant outings like that.”

Berroa’s path has uniquely converged with those of Kaminsky and Shipley a pair of 2013 first-round Draft picks who briefly saw time with their original organizations -- St. Louis and Arizona respectively -- in the Majors before bouncing around and landing with Seattle. As they work their way back up the pair have also served as de facto mentors for Arkansas’ much younger arms.

“Those guys are selfless” McGrath said. “They’re leaders both by example and in the things they teach the younger guys. It’s been a thrill to have them around.”

The last time Shipley was in Double-A in 2015 he ranked as MLB Pipeline’s No. 39 prospect in all of baseball and found himself in the Arizona rotation the following summer. He has not yet been able to translate his first-round pedigree to the Majors recording a 5.79 ERA in 100 innings over three seasons and bounced around to the Royals and Reds organizations -- as well as a stint in Mexico -- before the Mariners gave him a call this past March.

Working exclusively out of the Travelers bullpen Shipley now 30 years old has a 3.45 ERA in 47 innings including the ninth on Friday.

“I was telling the guys that this year has been interesting for me” he said. “It’s the first time I’ve been back in Double-A and I’ve just embraced it. But it was the first time in a while I’ve been nervous coming into a game. It felt good.”

If anything the nerves signaled the gravity of the moment. After navigating through the exit of the only organization he had known for seven years the pandemic season and three games with the Acereros de Monclova in Mexico Shipley contemplated retirement. But there was more to be done and to find.

“The last few years have been really rough for me” he said. “Mainly it’s been trying to figure out ‘Who am I? Who is Braden Shipley?’ I think with the help of a lot of people -- way too many to name -- they’ve gotten me to where I am today just comfortable with who I am now.”

Shipley jokes that he and Kaminsky throwing partners all season don’t require nearly as many tosses to get their arms loose before games. But after their own work is finished they’ll transition into their other roles.

“Having a lot of failures the last few years has kind of set me up to go out there and pitch with a little bit of freedom and have success but more importantly share my experiences with some of these younger guys. I’ve just been so fortunate to help them advise them whatever I can do. It’s really rewarding and I couldn’t be happier to spend this night with them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvMjAyMi8wOC8xMy9kaXNuZXktYnVkZ2V0LXRpcHMtdGlja2V0cy1ob3RlbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney World budget tips: How to save on tickets hotels and food,"4 Buy your Disney gear and souvenirs elsewhere

The country has adopted a conservation strategy based on high-end low-volume tourism which means it’s free of crowds and mass-market resorts. There is no shortage of expensive lodges: butlers to draw your bath; tasting menus to rival Michelin-star restaurants; well-stocked wine cellars that wouldn’t look out of place in either London or New York. But with some savvy planning Botswana doesn’t have to break the bank.

Here are our top tips to stretch your budget further in Botswana.

Travel to luxury lodges during the safari shoulder season

Good deals are rarer than black rhino sightings during Botswana’s peak season (June and September). Consider traveling in the shoulder season instead (April–May and October–November). This is when you can bag a bargain on accommodations and 4WD car rentals. The weather can be unpredictable as the seasons change from wet to dry and back again but Botswana has no shortage of wildlife action especially around permanent water sources.

Also ensure you check the flight distance of your chosen luxury lodge from Maun. It's faster to fly but the further your lodge the more fuel and the pricier the return ticket. To bring the costs down you can drive to some luxury stays in the southeastern delta and Khwai areas or even ask about boating access between camps.

Embrace the rainy season for a great Botswana deal

Green season (aka the wet rainy season) from December to March is cheaper still as some lodges slash their rates by up to 40% – though some shut entirely especially in the wettest months of January and February. Roads and tracks can become difficult to navigate but the rains bring lush landscapes and the zebra migration commences at Nxai Pan National Park. Areas like Chobe National Park and Moremi Game Reserve in the Okavango Delta are so jam-packed with wild creatures that it really doesn’t matter which time of year you go.

Set off on a self-drive safari and save

If you’re confident behind the wheel of a 4WD a self-drive safari is one of the most wallet-friendly ways to explore Botswana: a week’s rental can cost less than a night in a luxury lodge. As a bonus you can go from desert to delta at your own speed. Want to spend a couple of hours watching a playful pride of lions or staking out a wild dog den? No problem.

You still need to be fully prepared. Plan your route (no driving after dark) and arrange your campsite reservations and national park permits in advance. Download an offline map such as Tracks4Africa and consider renting a satellite phone for any off-the-grid emergencies.

Rent the vehicle from a company such as Avis or pay a bit more for a fully equipped 4WD complete with a rooftop tent and cooking gear from a self-drive safari specialist such as Drive Botswana which can also organize your itinerary and book accommodation for you. The only extra costs will be fuel food drinking water and firewood which you can pick up cheaply in Kasane or Maun.

Join a small-group adventurous mobile safari

Join a small-group 4WD tour and you’ll set up camp in different bush locations while eating under the stars and leaving no footprint. You’ll be surrounded by the wilderness from the moment you unzip your tent and you’ll travel with a top-notch guide who makes wildlife spotting easy.

If you’re happy being hands-on – pitching and taking down your tent washing dishes and helping dismantle and set up camp – a semi-participation safari is the cheapest option. You’ll share your two-person tent the bush toilet and bucket shower; all you need is a sleeping bag.

Otherwise you can upgrade to a fully serviced mobile safari – still a fraction of the price of a high-end lodge – where your walk-in tent comes with a camp bed and an en-suite bathroom. Look into Letaka Safaris’ 10-day Northern Highlights all-inclusive safari (from US$3725 per person during the green season).

Hop onto a mokoro canoe campout from Maun

Most (pricey) luxury lodges in the delta organize mokoro (canoe) trips but you can also arrange your own mokoro adventure from Maun. The Okavango Kopano Mokoro Community Trust is an overarching association for all local polers and operates in the eastern Okavango in the NG32 concession which is roughly an hour's drive north of Maun depending on water levels.

Outings range from day trips (with a round-trip 4WD drive of two to three hours to the point of embarkation) to affordable multi-day camping excursions on islands encircled by floodwaters which makes carefully considered planning an absolute must. Most trips also include guided nature walks so please bring a hat decent shoes and sunscreen.

There are two ways to support these community polers. Book directly with the trust office in Maun and bring all your own gear such as tents food and cooking equipment to overnight in the delta. Alternatively use a mobile safari operator which provides all the camping kit (down to en suite pit latrine ablutions and stretchers for a decent sleep) plus excellent meals so all you have to do is kick back and enjoy the ride.

Board an overland truck to tick off major sights

Group safaris come in all shapes and sizes: if you’re time-rich and cash-poor overlanding in a purpose-built truck is a time-honored way to explore the African continent from Cairo to Cape Town and all points in between.

With companies such as On the Go Tours and Intrepid Botswana is usually teamed up with Victoria Falls Namibia and South Africa for 10-day itineraries and longer. These options are not only cheaper than a small-group tour with campsites meals and some excursions included but they’re also a great way to meet fellow travelers especially if you’re visiting Botswana solo.

Choose a drive-in instead of a fly-in camp

Because of Botswana’s sheer size and the remoteness of some of its parks and reserves some camps can only be accessed by budget-busting charter flights so choose protected spaces and stays that can be easily reached by road such as the wildlife-rich Moremi Game Reserve and Khwai area the easy-to-access Chobe National Park or visit Baines’ Baobabs Nxai Pan National Park.

Focus on one national park or reserve

You don’t have to dip into different national parks and reserves to experience a range of habitats and wildlife and focusing on a single region cuts down on the cost of vehicle rental or transfers.

Decide your priorities: if you’ve got an urge to see elephants head to Chobe. If you’re desperate to see African wild dogs try Moremi Game Reserve. If you want to mingle with meerkats head to Gweta and the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans.

Swap a luxury lodge for a tent

Wild camping is illegal in Botswana but the country has no shortage of brilliant campsites. If you want to be immersed in nature opt for an unfenced area of a national park or reserve and expect to encounter numerous wild visitors. Some sites have a water faucet and a fire pit and they all have an ablution area with shared bathrooms and showers. You need to book a space in advance especially from June through September and make sure you set up camp before it gets dark.

Or you can opt for somewhere livelier to pitch your tent like Planet Baobab and enjoy the open-air bar-cum-restaurant and smart facilities all towered over by statuesque baobab trees that look a lot like the eternally wise Deku Tree from the Legend of Zelda game series.

Save money by basing yourself in the urban jungle

It might not be as atmospheric as wilderness camping but basing yourself in Maun – the gateway to the Okavango Delta Nxai Pans and the Central Kalahari – or Kasane a pebbles-throw from Chobe riverfront will give you access to more wallet-friendly accommodations grocery stores and local restaurants. Use the money you save to splurge on day-long game drives sunset cruises and even scenic flights.

Look out for budget-friendly lodges in five-star locations

If you’d be happier with four solid walls and a roof you can still save money on your trip to Botswana. Savvy travelers should seek out less pricey accommodations in the same vicinity as the super-luxe safari lodges: budget-oriented digs might not have all the bells and whistles sure but they’ll share the same landscapes and wild encounters.

For example Planet Baobab is the cheaper cousin of the renowned Jack’s Camp in the Makgadikgadi Pans. If you don’t want to camp you can book into a rondavel-style room. Game drives will get you up close to desert-adapted lions meerkats and the dazzling zebra migration.

Wildlife watching can be done from the road

With no fences keeping wildlife contained to reserve boundaries wildlife often crosses the major highway routes in Northern Botswana between Nata and Kasane as you drive towards Chobe National Park and also Nata and Maun which passes through the Makgadikgadi National Park. It’s not uncommon to encounter elephants giraffes zebras ostriches sables and even Southern ground hornbills on these tarred roads."

The MVP is meant to be an award for the entire regular season but voters are human and human beings tend to be swayed by recent performance. Moreover some old-school voters might put more weight on production that comes down the stretch during the postseason chase.

Austin Riley Has Earned His Success in 2022

Riley has been one of the best hitters in baseball this season but he still trails Paul Goldschmidt in most offensive categories. He is second to Goldschmidt in both OPS and wOBA. He is third behind Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado in the park-adjusted metric wRC+.

However he outranks both Cardinals sluggers in all of the Statcast metrics that measure quality of contact. He is the only player in the league who ranks in the top three in both wOBA and expected wOBA.

Riley ranks first in the National League in hard hit rate and expected slugging percentage. He is second in barrel rate and fourth in expected batting average.

So not only has Riley has had great success at the plate but according to Statcast he has deserved all of that success.

This is not to say the MVP race should be decided by expected metrics. That’s not how the voters will make their decision nor should it be. Even so the fact that Riley has made such high quality contact is another argument in his favor. It is also a positive sign that he will continue to tear the cover off the ball going forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzZnJlZXByZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvYXVnLzEzL2J1c2luZXNzLWRpZ2VzdC0wODEzMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee appoints Moore to board of directors and more Chattanooga-area career moves,"Contributed Photo by Blue Cross Blue Shield/ Johnny Moore

""An unbelievable drunken karaoke party"" is how the Poison singer put it midway through the Minneapolis stop of the five-band Stadium Tour headlined by '80s hitmakers Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe. Or something resembling Mötley Crüe showed up anyway.

""Unbelievable"" was an apt word. Many of the nearly 50000 attendees — who came from across the Upper Midwest and indeed heavily imbibed along the way — had started to doubt the concert was ever going to happen.

The second-eldest and yet most ageless of the tour's singers at 63 Joan Jett expressed the relief shared by all the vocalists to finally be on the tour which was first announced in 2019 but twice delayed by COVID.

""It's good just to be out!"" she yelled in her unmistakable guttural New York voice. ""It took three years just to make this happen.""

Following opening band Classless Act Jett and her Blackhearts delivered a snappy sometimes snarling overview of her 46-year career including two songs by her first group the Runaways (""Cherry Bomb"" ""You Drive Me Wild"") and audience-accompanied singalongs of her 1980s hits (""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"" ""Bad Reputation""). She also reworked ""I'm Gonna Run Away"" from a new pandemic-spawned acoustic album that made for a refreshing musical change-up.

""Gotta get away from the same old same old"" proved to be an ironic lyric during Poison's set. With carefully tinted hair all that's left of their old glam look the Pennsylvania rockers not only stuck strictly to their old hits but also to their sidelined brand of ""Nothin' But a Good Time"" '80s joviality per the title of their final song.

Michaels proudly boasted of avoiding political commentary before saluting U.S. troops with ""Fallen Angel."" Their set's only bit of drama came before ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"" when he praised drummer Rikki Rockett for beating cancer in the mid-2010s. The singer himself proved resilient too with the strongest voice of the night's three veteran frontmen.

Now a talking point as well-documented as drummer Tommy Lee's exploits with ex-wife Pamela Anderson Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil just does not have a passable singing voice anymore. His performance Sunday was downright painful. As grating as hearing him squawk out the words the 61-year-old survivor also sometimes resorted to voicing vague syllables instead of actual words. The chorus to the band's second song ""Shout at the Devil"" for example sounded something more like ""Shez bed a doobie.""

Not helping matters — or who knows maybe it actually helped? — the Crüe suffered the worst from U.S. Bank Stadium's notoriously echoey and muddy acoustics.

Mick Mars' distinctively devilish guitar work was largely lost to Lee's heavy drumming in old shredders like ""Live Wire"" and ""Looks That Kill."" Backup singers who stupidly doubled as pole-dancers — even the most libidinous men in the audience would've preferred the women stick to covering for Neil on vocals — were barely audible when sorely needed in ""Same Old Situation"" and ""Kickstart My Heart.""

The Crüe did have an impressive hi-fi stage production with a fun use of lasers pyro and old video though. There: something nice.

With a still recognizable if more rugged voice behind the mic and a better-sounding if still bouncy audio mix Def Leppard fulfilled Michaels' comment about the concert turning into a karaoke party.

The British vets opened with a new song ""Take What You Want"" but soon enough the crowd was singing along loudly to the old hits starting with ""Animal"" and ""Foolin'."" Anybody who still knows how to operate an FM radio could have sung through three-fourths of the band's 90-minute set especially the finale trifecta of ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" ""Rock of Ages"" and ""Photograph.""

""The world has been through some [expletive] times but it's 2022 ... and here we are"" singer Joe Elliott said in a serious moment eschewing Michaels' call for nothing but a good time.

Good enough though.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3IudmFuZ3VhcmQuY29tL2FjY291bnRzLXBsYW5zL3Zhbmd1YXJkLWNhc2gtcGx1cy1hY2NvdW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's the Vanguard Cash Plus Account?,"The Fund is only available to retail investors (natural persons).

Roughly one in ten people who moved to Israel from the United States — 333 out of 3480 — made their first home in the West Bank. This compared to the 2.6 percent who did the same from France 1.7% from Russia and 1.6% from Ukraine.

On average 3.2% of all new immigrants including Americans move to settlements upon arriving in the country.

The 333 American immigrants who moved to settlements represent a major increase in real numbers over previous years; in 2020 fewer than 200 American immigrants moved to settlements. But that is due to an overall rise in immigration to Israel from the US in 2021 not a change in the overall trend.

Last year was a banner year for immigration to Israel from the US with some 4000 people making the move the highest number since 1973 according to the Immigration and Absorption Ministry. This was in part due to a backlog created the year before because of the coronavirus pandemic. The ministry counted more arrivals as immigrants than the CBS because it uses slightly different criteria to determine who qualifies as a new immigrant.

Yet the share of new American immigrants moving to settlements has remained relatively consistent over the past decade or so with roughly 10-15% ultimately opting to move to the West Bank according to Sarah Hirschorn associate professor of Israel studies at Northwestern University who has extensively researched the role of American Jews in the settlement enterprise.

“The percentage moving to settlements — we don’t know the exact number — that’s been very consistent over the past decade” Hirschorn said.

The precise number is not clear as the Central Bureau of Statistics is able to track the first place where new immigrants chose to settle not where they ultimately end up. So if a family immediately arrives in Jerusalem but then moves to the Neve Daniel settlement after a few months this would not appear in the CBS figures.

In her book “City on a Hilltop: American Jews and the Israeli Settler Movement” Hirschorn estimates that American citizens represent 15% of the overall settlement population a significantly disproportionate figure based on a variety of data sources. Less than 200000 US citizens are estimated to live in Israel or roughly 2.2% of the total Israeli population.

Hirschorn attributes this inflated presence of American Jews in the West Bank to a combination of ideology and the natural draw of the settlements to English-speaking religious immigrants.

Immigration to Israel or aliyah from the US is overwhelmingly a matter of personal preference. Unlike Russian Jews escaping an increasingly totalitarian regime or French Jews fleeing antisemitism American Jews are running to Israel not away from the US.

“American aliyah — despite the current rise in antisemitism — is still an aliyah of choice. The French and Russians are trying to get the hell out of dodge because they perceive a threat” Hirschorn said.

The majority of the American Jews making that choice are Orthodox a group that is more likely to support the settlement enterprise she said.

“Living in settlements has become normalized within the Orthodox community in the United States. The political nature of that act has become erased or at least toned down” Hirschorn said.

Alongside these ideological drives there are also practical motivations drawing American immigrants to settlements.

“It’s familiar to many Americans. Just like Jerusalem is full of anglos” — the commonly used term for English-speaking Israelis — “so is Efrat and Neve Daniel” she said referring to two settlements popular with American immigrants in the Etzion bloc outside Jerusalem.

Indeed while roughly 10% of American immigrants move to settlements a full half move to Jerusalem compared to 21.7% of French immigrants and 3.4% of Russians in 2021.

Settlements in the Etzion bloc offer American immigrants a chance to live just outside of Jerusalem — a 25-minute drive to the center of the city without traffic — in a suburban setting.

“Most of these Americans are going to nice neighborhoods with family homes or large apartments that are on the level of what they might have had in the US” Hirschorn said.

The existing outsized number of American citizens living in settlements perpetuates itself as immigrants tend to seek out fellow countrymen to ease their transition into a new country. It also explains why immigrants from other countries even people who may politically support settlements are more likely to settle elsewhere.

“Immigrants tend to surround themselves with other kinfolk until they integrate into society” Hirschorn said. “For French and Russian Jews that’s not the settlements.”

French Russian and Ukrainian immigrants tend to move to cities with already large expat populations.

For French immigrants this means the coastal city of Netanya where roughly a third of them wound up in 2021 and Tel Aviv where a quarter did. Russian and Ukrainian immigrants spread out more evenly between Tel Aviv Haifa and the central southern and northern districts according to the CBS figures."

In an email sent to customers Uber explains that users can still earn points until the end of August and that the last day to redeem points is October 31st.

“Thank you for being part of Uber Rewards” the email reads. “It’s been a great ride but we’ve decided to end Rewards soon as we shift our focus to our new Uber One membership program.”

The email sent to Uber Rewards users. Screenshot: Uber via Michael Konen

Uber has since posted an update about the loyalty program’s imminent shutdown which will take place on November 1st 2022. Launched in 2018 Uber Rewards is a free program that lets you rack up points for every dollar you spend when hitching a ride or ordering food through Uber and Uber Eats. You can then use these points to earn discounts on future rides or deliveries. The more points you earn the better perks you get — earning 7500 points for example unlocks the highest Diamond tier which comes with benefits like premium customer support complimentary ride upgrades better drivers and three free Uber Eats deliveries.

But now that’s all going away. Uber isn’t offering a replacement for the program and there isn’t another way to consistently earn perks and discounts unless you pay for an Uber One subscription which Uber launched as a replacement for Eats Pass last year. A $9.99 / month (or $99.99 / year) subscription comes with perks like free food deliveries up to 10 percent off of “eligible” Uber Eats orders and 5 percent off on rides from top-rated drivers.

Uber’s giving existing Rewards members a free one-month subscription to Uber One but you’ll still have to pay after that. As a frequent Uber Eats user (who refuses to pay for an Uber One subscription) it’s a bit upsetting to see Uber taking away a free and easily accessible loyalty program something that’s becoming much harder to find these days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC91YmVyLXRvLXN1bnNldC1mcmVlLWxveWFsdHktcHJvZ3JhbS1pbi1mYXZvci1vZi1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb24tbWVtYmVyc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber to sunset free loyalty program in favor of subscription membership,"Ride-hailing giant Uber is shutting down its free loyalty program Uber Rewards so it can focus on its subscription-based Uber One membership.

Uber first launched the rewards program in 2018 as a sort of frequent flyer scheme that allowed riders to earn points for every dollar spent on rides or Uber Eats deliveries. Those points could then be used to get discounts on future rides or deliveries. In November 2021 Uber began introducing Uber One which for $9.99 per month or $99.99 annually allows members perks like 5% off certain rides or delivery orders and unlimited $0 delivery fees on food orders of over $15 and grocery orders of over $30.

In an email sent to customers that was picked up by The Verge Uber said users can still earn points via the legacy rewards program until the end of August and that they can redeem those points until October 31. Uber Rewards will officially shut down on November 1 2022 according to an update posted by the company.

The Uber Rewards program allowed users to earn 1x point for every Uber Pool dollar spent 2x for every UberX dollar spent and 3x for every $1 spent on Premium. The number of points accumulated would put members into different castes of loyalty from Blue to Gold to Platinum to Diamond the latter of which comes with benefits like access to highly rated drivers free delivery on three Uber Eats orders access to better customer service and free upgrades.

While phone support will continue for Diamond users now the only way to get additional perks with Uber will be to shell out for a subscription. Existing Rewards members will get a free one-month subscription to Uber One but then will be charged for access. If you’re someone who orders Uber Eats more than twice a month you can easily break even with the Uber One subscription but plenty of users might not see the money saving benefits in the switch.

Uber did not respond immediately for clarity as to why it is shutting down the Rewards program in favor of the Uber One membership. Perhaps the company did not see the returns and user loyalty that it would have expected from the program and thinks a subscription offering will provide better returns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3ViZXItZHJvcHMtZnJlZS1yZXdhcmRzLXByb2dyYW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Makes a Change That Will Upset Riders,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/uber-drops-free-rewards-program on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3ViZXItZHJvcHMtZnJlZS1yZXdhcmRzLXByb2dyYW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvdWJlci1yZXdhcmRzLWVuZGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sad: Uber Rewards Loyalty Program Ending,"Uber has announced that it’s going to end its loyalty program this fall.

Uber Rewards program ends October 31 2022

The Uber Rewards program will be ending as of October 31 2022 as the ride sharing giant claims to instead be focused on its Uber One membership program.

Uber Rewards members can continue to take advantage of benefits and redeem points through October 31 2022 but at that point the program will cease to exist. Uber is also offering many Uber Rewards members one free month of Uber One with the catch that it will auto-renew so presumably many people will forget to cancel it.

For those not familiar with Uber Rewards the program offers 1-3x points for Uber spending including on rides and food delivery orders. Those rewards can then be redeemed for certain perks like discounts on rides discounted food deliveries etc. Uber Rewards also offers elite status with perks like being matched with top-rated drivers flexible cancelation and more.

Uber had already devalued the program multiple times prior to this announcement of it being discontinued so I guess this shouldn’t be much of a surprise.

My take on Uber ending its loyalty program

First of all I find it disappointing that Uber is ending its loyalty program with such little notice. Uber customers have been qualifying for “status” which is supposed to offer value in the future but now those perks are being taken away. It’s one thing to say that you can’t earn status in the future but to take away status that has already been earned is disappointing. Unfortunately consumers probably don’t have much recourse here.

Second of all loyalty programs generally work really well which is why they’re so common especially in retail and travel. On some level this probably reflects that Uber has limited global competition. Yes in the US Lyft is a major competitor but that’s not the case internationally. Outside the United States Uber mostly competes with regional ride sharing apps.

Lastly I hate to say it but big picture I can kind of understand why Uber is ending its loyalty program. Uber is trying to promote the Uber One membership program. For $9.99 per month you receive many of the same perks that Uber Rewards potentially offers including being connected with top-rated drivers discounted food deliveries discounts on rides and more.

Uber is essentially going the Amazon route. Amazon doesn’t have a loyalty program but the paid Amazon Prime service almost tries to accomplish the same thing and makes people loyal. I can appreciate how there might be confusion between Uber One and Uber Rewards especially when both have some overlapping benefits.

Bottom line

The Uber Rewards loyalty program will be ending as of October 31 2022 so if you have any points make sure you redeem them before then. I find it disappointing how Uber is going about this essentially taking away the elite perks that people have earned.

The company is now shifting its focus to Uber One as clearly the company thinks it can use its paid membership service to create loyalty among customers rather than giving out rewards for “free.”

Article Hero Image

Ride-hailing service Uber is closing down its loyalty program Uber Rewards with users being urged to sign up for the Uber One subscription to get regular Uber and Uber Eats discounts.

Since 2018 Uber Rewards provided users with discounted rides and food deliveries by earning points from spending money on the service. The free-to-join loyalty program is now being wound up in favor of a paid alternative.

In an email to Uber Rewards users seen by The Verge and an update to support pages users are warned that Uber Rewards is ending on November 1 2022. Participants will continue to earn rewards points until August 31 and will have until October 31 to redeem any points in their account against any applicable rewards.

Uber won't be replacing Uber Rewards directly but instead is nudging users in the direction of Uber One. All Uber Rewards users will be able to try out the Uber One membership free for a month according to the email.

Rather than requiring users to earn rewards Uber One instead works from a monthly fee of $9.99 or $49.99 per year. For that fee users get to place Uber Eats orders without paying a delivery fee get up to 10% off eligible Uber Eats deliveries and pickup orders 5% off Uber rides from top-rated drivers and other bonuses.

The closure of Uber Rewards may be unwelcome to high-volume users of the service since they would also be high points earners.

At a growing number of stores it also has mini Ulta Beauty shops with prestige brands.

As prices creep up some people have decided against getting a new outfit delayed big purchases like TVs or cancelled Netflix accounts.

But for now they're still splurging on beauty.

For retailers the beauty category has become a rare bright spot as people pull back on spending amid surging inflation. Often seen as an affordable luxury it is the only discretionary retail category with rising unit sales in the first half of the year according to The NPD Group which tracks categories including clothing tech and toys as well as beauty products at specialty and department stores.

""You may not be able to go out to eat out as much but you can buy yourself a lipstick"" said Olivia Tong an analyst for Raymond James.

This spring Target called out the strength of its beauty sales even as it twice cut its profit outlook for the year. Walmart is also investing in the category and rolling out new beauty displays to hundreds of stores despite its warnings that shoppers are skipping over discretionary categories like apparel.

Other factors work in the industry's favor too. Weddings and parties have picked up again. More people are heading back to the office and can no longer hide behind their Zoom filters. And during the pandemic some people got in the habit of pampering themselves at home with face masks hair treatments and other beauty products.

Larissa Jensen a beauty analyst for NPD called it the return of the ""lipstick index"" — a term made famous by Leonard Lauder chairman of the board of Estee Lauder  to explain climbing sales of cosmetics during the recession in the early 2000s.

As consumer sentiment has fallen lipstick sales volume has climbed Jensen said. That increase has carried over to other beauty products. Makeup sales including lipstick are up 20% skincare is up 12% fragrance is up 15% and hair care is up 28% for the first half of the year — and they are all growing in units as well as dollars she said.

Much of the beauty category's growth is coming from households that earn over $100000 a year and Jensen said discounters may have a tougher time capitalizing on the trend. Still beauty's resilience could provide some cushion for big-box retailers in a slowdown − if they can figure out how to cash in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS90YXJnZXQtbWFrZXMtc3RyaWRlcy10by1iZXR0ZXItc2VydmUtYmxhY2stY3VzdG9tZXJzLWFuZC1lbXBsb3llZXMvNjAwMTk4MDU1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Target makes strides to better serve Black customers and employees,"Target Corp. earmarked billions of dollars for Black businesses and communities to address racial equity issues after the police killing of George Floyd two years ago.

The Minneapolis retailer made visible strides in that time but a review of its benchmarks shows it still has a way to go to meet all of its goals.

Target increased its share of Black company officers added more year-round products by Black entrepreneurs and expanded its base of contractors. While some experts suggest retailers' interest in diversity is declining Target executives vow to stay the course.

""You would never have a financial office that didn't set goals that didn't set targets"" said Kiera Fernandez Target's chief diversity and inclusion officer. ""We have to have that same mindset when we think of diversity equity and inclusion.""

Target leaders say they had already begun work to better serve Black workers and customers when Floyd's murder on Memorial Day 2020 led to more calls for action about ending the unfair treatment of Black people in America.

In summer 2020 Target formed the REACH (Racial Equity Action and Change) committee to spearhead some new lofty visions such as creating retail environments in which Black customers felt welcomed and finding new ways to help grow the prosperity of Black communities.

Target has since added more tangible benchmarks and financial commitments including promising to contribute $100 million through 2025 to Black-led organizations; spend more than $2 billion on Black-owned businesses including marketing agencies and construction companies by the end of 2025; and spend 5% of Target's annual media budget on Black-owned media this year.

Target is not the only company to focus more on diversity and equity since Floyd's death. Retailers including Nordstrom Sephora Macy's Ulta Beauty and the Gap have accepted the Fifteen Percent Pledge which was launched in 2020 to advocate for Black businesses to make up 15% of retailers' shelf space.

""The pandemic mixed with social changes has made many consumers demand more from their retailers"" said Kim Sovell a marketing professor at the University of St. Thomas. ""I'm not talking about good prices. I'm talking about thoughtfulness.""

According to McKinsey & Co. nearly half of consumers they recently surveyed in the United States believe companies should pledge to support Black-owned brands and vendors with a larger percentage of younger consumers including Gen Zers and millennials thinking that's important. Also Black consumers who have historically been underserved have hundreds of billions of dollars of buying power that they are willing to redirect research shows.

At Target one of the REACH committee's big priorities has been to increase the variety of products by Black founders. Target currently offers more than 100 Black-owned items which the retailer began to label in 2020. Target now aims to sell more than 500 products from Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025.

Tabitha Brown is one of the latest Black designers that Target has partnered with.

One of Target's new partnerships has been with Black actress and social media influencer Tabitha Brown. She recently released the second of her four colorful Target collections of apparel home goods and kitchenware.

""I love fashion and I studied fashion in school and that was one of my dreams to do clothing and a line and never would I have ever dreamt that my first [assortment] would have been at Target"" Brown said.

Brown who is 43 said when she was growing up she didn't see a lot of Black girls and women represented at major retailers.

""We deserve to be in spaces with everybody else"" she said. ""We deserve to be seen. We deserve to be heard. And so I think the world has finally caught on to that.""

In another improvement Target said it doubled the amount of its Black-owned partners since 2020. Target is finalizing an advertising partnership with Sheletta Brundidge a local Black comedian and radio host who criticized Target last year for not supporting Twin Cities Black media outlets.

""People are asking for receipts"" Brundidge said. ""Did you honor your commitments? Did you do what you said you are going to do?""

Target plans to buy ads on Brundidge's podcast network. General Mills is another recent sponsor for her podcast she said.

""We aren't going to have no Black businesses if our Fortune 500 companies don't hire us as vendors"" Brundidge said. ""It's long overdue.""

Target also increased the number of Black workers in higher positions. Last fiscal year 10% of its officers were Black up from 5% in 2019. Black employees accounted for 15.5% of its overall workforce last year compared to 15.6% in 2019.

The retailer has also experienced some difficult moments. Last year several employees at the St. Paul Midway Target complained about a Juneteenth break room display they said played into Black stereotypes with a table of cherry Kool-Aid packets watermelon candy and servings of hot sauce.

Some have also pointed out that the retailer over the years has closed Target stores in urban Black neighborhoods.

Target representatives said it follows a rigorous process to evaluate the performance of every store and the company continues to stay committed to open locations that serve all customers including new stores in Flatbush a neighborhood in New York City and Los Angeles' Inglewood neighborhood.

Lul Osman shopped for body wash at Target earlier this month.

Jesse Ross a Minneapolis-based diversity and inclusion consultant said he thinks many companies who were vocal about supporting racial equity in the wake of Floyd's death have begun to turn their focus to other business challenges.

""I think the stamina for folks committed to these diversity goals has changed. ... The majority of the culture doesn't want to do the work"" Ross said.

Fernandez acknowledges some diversity goals may not be reached in the time that Target originally wanted. She also said that despite strategies and policies it is still possible for individual employees to make mistakes that could go against Target's inclusivity intentions. There's ""no endpoint"" to the company's diversity efforts Fernandez said.

""We are not perfect"" she said. ""We are in pursuit of equity inclusion and a place where everyone is seen and valued. And along the way we will bump our head and bump our toe because we are all humans.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2Nvbm5lY3RpY3V0L3NvdXRoaW5ndG9uL3BsYWludmlsbGUtcG9saWNlLWxvb2tpbmctaWQtdGhlZnQtc3VzcGVjdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plainville Police Looking To ID Theft Suspect | Southington CT Patch,"Police are looking to identify the suspect in a local theft.

The concealer is available in 20 shades on .

Kate Hudson is never one to shy away from sharing her beauty faves. Whether divulging every aspect of her skincare routine or sharing the best magic cream  she never steers us wrong. In 2022 the Almost Famous star blessed her Instagram followers with a video of her morning routine which she says takes a mere five minutes. Plenty of products go into the actress’s signature glow but the true star in our eyes is  which Hudson uses as an under-eye concealer.

The powerhouse product from vegan makeup brand Monika Blunder Beauty can be used as a cream foundation for a sheer natural finish or as an under-eye concealer to achieve a brightening lifted effect. The buildable cream formula also makes for easy application and blendable coverage. Plus per the brand experimenting with shades that are slightly lighter or darker than your natural skin tone allows the product to double as a creamy highlighter or contour.

But the best part is the lineup of nourishing ingredients that make the product “as gentle on your personal ecosystem as possible” according to the brand. Included in the list are antioxidant-rich botanicals like arnica flower rosemary and edelweiss extracts which soothe dryness and irritation. Meanwhile vitamin E-rich sunflower seed oil and soothing aloe vera plump and hydrate the skin while chamomile reduces redness.

Monika Blunder’s multipurpose Blunder Cover is available in 20 shades on for $52 and customers are loving it every bit as much as the How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days actress.

“My sensitive skin loves this product!” writes one reviewer. “Great coverage doesn’t feel heavy and has no perfumes.” “I’ve tried every foundation under the sun and this is the best 100%!” adds another. “So easy and nice to put on [and I] always get compliments when wearing.”

Sounds like we’ll be adding the Blunder Cover to our carts immediately along with other recommendations featured in Hudson’s routine including her top picks for serums moisturizer bronzer sunscreen and more. Shop them all below.

As the summer days begin to dwindle it’s time to prepare for the fall days ahead and that begins with heading back to school. Whether it’s heading to high school or starting your freshman year in college you have to have your beauty game on lock and we know just what you need to not only look good but also feel good.

“This year and every year natural-looking skin is in” says celebrity makeup artist and esthetician Brianna Meshack. “Women are wearing less and paying attention to details that matter like a fierce brow great skin and a bold lip. Celebrities that do it well are Rihanna Marsai Martin Normani Lori Harvey.”

Meshack also mentions that your skincare routine should be a big part of your routine instead of applying too much makeup. “A great skincare regimen that includes a balancing cleanser AHA exfoliants a pH-balancing toner and a hydrating moisturizer should do the trick.”

When it comes to hair looks beauty expert Sir Tony had the deets on what young ladies are looking for when it comes to back-to-school styles. “Young Black women are becoming increasingly aware of just how beautiful their natural curls are” he shares. “You also have girls that don’t want to deal with their hair daily so they are moving towards braids which is also very chic.”

Sir Tony predicts that box braids and twists are what you will see more of on campus as students hustle and bustle back and forth to classes. “It’s important to get a style that’s versatile so you can wear it different ways.”

He also mentions that hair accessories are a great way to make your hairstyle uniquely you. “Beautifully embroidered clips and bobby pins are being worn to take styles up a notch.”

Archer Aviation [NYSE:ACHR] is one of the holdings in the AdvisorShares Drone Technology ETF [NYSE ARCA:UAV] the only ETF dedicated to the drone economy. The AdvisorShares Drone Technology ETF is a thematic investment strategy seeking to capture the growth opportunities in drones and autonomous vehicles (AV). AdvisorShares is a DRONELIFE sponsor.

Today Archer Aviation announced that United Airlines has submitted a pre-delivery payment of $10 million for 100 of Archer’s initial production eVTOL aircraft.

Continue reading below or listen:

This serves as a major milestone for the eVTOL industry illustrating trust in the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft as well as Archer’s leadership. United initially agreed to the purchase of 100 aircraft from Archer last year demonstrating its interest in becoming one of the first U.S. airline operators to bring eVTOL aircraft to market.

Archer recently completed its production aircraft’s Preliminary Design Review (PDR) a thorough evaluation of the aircraft design to guarantee the program is ready to advance to the next stage of development and initiate the production of long lead time hardware. The review examines each element of the aircraft’s specifications and manufacturing requirements in order to assess the design’s feasibility for regulatory compliance and to bring to market.

This is United’s latest showing of support throughout Archer’s development process. The two companies recently formed a Joint eVTOL Advisory Committee enabling both parties to more closely collaborate on eVTOL maintenance and operational concerns. The committee features members from Archer’s operations and maintenance leadership as well as United’s maintenance materials and engineering leadership.

“I am incredibly proud of the entire Archer team as we reach this milestone in our partnership with United Airlines” said Archer CEO Adam Goldstein. “To receive a cash deposit is validation of Archer’s achievements to date not only with flight testing and product development but also a great signal of confidence in our roadmap to commercialization. We’re thankful to United for their continued partnership as we usher in this new era in air travel.”

“This announcement marks a new important phase in our relationship with Archer and our commitment to EVTOL technology. We are witnessing an inflection point where consumers businesses and policymakers are all aligned to prioritize technology that reduces the impact of climate change” said United Airlines Ventures President Michael Leskinen. “United Airlines Ventures has invested in a diverse roster of companies working in support of our goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 without the use of traditional carbon offsets. We believe eVTOLs have the potential to both help achieve carbon-neutral travel and serve as an innovative new tool to change how United customers experience comfort convenience and efficiency during their commutes within cities across the globe.”

It’s happened to everyone — you’re presented with an iPad to pay for your purchase and a screen appears asking how much you want to tip. The problem is you’re at a coffee shop bakery fast food restaurant or other establishment where tipping wasn’t previously a thing.

Here It Is: Our 2022 Small Business Spotlight

Learn: 7 Things You Should Never Do When Planning for Retirement

But since the option is now in front of you the pressure is on to leave a tip — even if you don’t necessarily feel it’s warranted. However you want to handle the situation correctly so you can proudly show your face at the business again.

Pamela Eyring president of The Protocol School of Washington said that while it is discretionary tipping at checkout is appropriate — if you receive extra service.

“If they greet you by remembering your name and giving you eye contact with a smile sharing any specials or new items they repeat your order in detail — just the way you ordered it — and are friendly — not just barely acknowledging your presence” she said. “Or if someone delivers food to your home or brings it out to your car you could consider a tip.”

She said you can also opt to give a tip to be extra kind. “Times are tough” she said. “If you’re in good shape financially providing gratuity is an appropriate act of kindness.”



If there happens to be a tip jar next to the iPad prompting you for a tip she recommended choosing the cash option. “Cash is still king” she said. “Tipping in cash is always appreciated because there are no deductions.”

While that’s all fine and good Maryanne Parker — founder of Manor of Manners an etiquette consulting firm based in San Diego — said you also don’t need to feel guilty about not leaving extra at common spots where people don’t necessarily expect to tip. Let’s go through a few of these places.

Coffee Shops

“Most of the time in the coffee shop we are not served; we simply order the coffee and wait a few minutes to grab it and go on with our daily routine” Parker said. “We can round up the bill — for example if the coffee is $2.50 we definitely can leave $0.50 extra — but we are certainly not obligated.”

Take Our Poll: Do You Tip for Service?

Bakeries

“I love the donut shop nearby and I often get donuts for my family” she said. “At times if I purchase a dozen they might add an extra donut. I always give them a little tip because I love their generosity.”

However she said if she just purchases a donut and a coffee she might just round up the bill or opt not to tip at all if she doesn’t have change.

Story continues

“The service is still great but it is not time-consuming just to pick up a donut” she said.

Fast Food Restaurants

You might feel pressured to tip at a local fast food restaurant but Parker said there’s no obligation. “I do not tip at my local taco shop every single time” she said. “However I am a regular customer and they know that I will be back and support their business.”

She said she isn’t able to tip on every trip to the restaurant but shows her support by being their customer.

“A good business won’t be upset if we do not leave a tip every time” she said. “Depending on how time-consuming our order was and if it was a takeaway it shouldn’t be that complicated and we can just move on without tipping every single time we see the tip option on the iPad.”

Ultimately Parker said tipping should always feel like your choice. “Many people believe that in the U.S. the tipping practice is a little excessive” she said. “However from an etiquette perspective we should tip based only on good service.”

Therefore she disagrees with the idea that you need to tip regardless of the quality of service you receive.

“Tipping for any kind of service even a bad one doesn’t help the purpose of tipping” she said.

Since leaving gratuity is supposed to be a show of appreciation for receiving excellent service she said there can be further implications for unwarranted tipping.



“If I did experience bad service and I am required to tip — based on people’s opinions or exaggerated charges — I would leave the establishment frustrated and unhappy” she said. “On another hand the customer service will start deteriorating because the wait staff won’t work for their tip because they will be expecting it either way.”

So there you have it — the next time you’re faced with an iPad at checkout prompting you to leave a tip you don’t feel is necessary you can opt out guilt-free.

So far this year a web of companies with ties to Toronto-based Tricon Residential Inc. have bought 38 homes in Bartholomew County — including 19 in the Shadow Creek Farms neighborhood — in some cases paying around $70000 to $100000 more than the assessed value to acquire the properties according to real estate records.

The companies — each starting with the prefix “SFR JV-2” — are part of a joint venture between Tricon the Teacher Retirement System of Texas Pacific Life Insurance Co. and an undisclosed foreign investor to “assemble a portfolio of single-family rental homes” in the United States according to regulatory filings and reports from credit rating agencies.

Another group of companies with ties to Tricon starting with prefixes “SFR JV-1” and “SFR JV-HD” also have been purchasing homes in Bartholomew County.

Tricon is one of America’s biggest landlords owning about 30000 single-family rental homes in the United States. Investment fund Blackstone Group the largest owner of commercial real estate in the world is one of Tricon’s biggest investors.

Over the past two years companies linked to Tricon have bought 59 single-family homes in Bartholomew County for a total $15 million local real estate records show. During that time the companies have spent $8.2 million to acquire 33 homes in the Shadow Creek Farms neighborhood located near W. County Road 200 S. and Interstate 65.

In addition the companies have bought nine homes for $2.26 million in the Northbrook neighborhood near Columbus Municipal Airport and six others for $1.61 million in the Broadmoor neighborhood north of National Road between Central Avenue and Middle Road.

Real estate analysts say the recent influx of institutional investors in Bartholomew County’s housing market reflects a trend that has been playing out across the United States as an “unprecedented housing market” has fueled the companies’ appetite for single-family homes.

The companies — private equity firms real estate investment trusts pension funds sovereign wealth funds among others — are unwelcome players in the market for many first-time homebuyers who are already facing stiff competition for affordable homes and often can’t compete with big-pocketed companies that can make all-cash offers and forgo inspections or other due diligence.

“It’s a national trend that (institutional investors) are consuming more of the market” said Sara Coers associate director of the IU Center for Real Estate Studies. “…They’re acquiring big chunks of neighborhoods entire neighborhoods. There are actually developers who are developing for-rent neighborhoods.”

“They’re really squeezing out first-time buyers more than anything” Coers added. “…It’s basically turning everything that would have been an affordable homeownership situation into a rental situation.”

‘Unprecedented housing market’

Investors’ shift toward single-family rentals marks a departure from what real estate investment trusts and other investors have traditionally poured their money into — commercial real estate including apartments analysts said.

These companies and other investors started eyeing previously owned single-family homes during the depths of the housing bust in the mid-2000s gobbling up foreclosed properties at bargain prices often by the thousands The Associated Press reported. Many of the properties were converted to rentals.

At the same time banks stopped lending on new construction people stopped building houses and developing new neighborhoods and building permits dipped substantially across the country including in Indiana which helped lay the foundation for an “unprecedented supply-demand imbalance” Coers said.

Even though the housing market has more than bounced back since then a dearth of homes for sale and surging demand for rental housing has motivated Wall Street to stake its investment on renting single-family homes rather than selling them in a housing market thirsty for inventory according to wire reports.

The COVID-19 pandemic also has further fueled demand for single-family homes.

In Bartholomew County the median sale price of homes has risen dramatically during the pandemic reaching $273000 during a four-week period from June 27 to July 24 up from $252000 during roughly the same period last year and $190000 in 2019 according to data from real estate company Redfin.

The institutional investors for their part are betting that would-be homebuyers frustrated by the priciest housing market in decades will settle for renting their slice of the American Dream.

Many people who are currently renting single-family homes in Indiana are paying upwards of $2200 to $2400 per month even though they could have had a monthly mortgage payment of around $600 to $700 for the same home a year ago Coers said. Though people are paying “substantially more” to live in those homes people “are just making it work because they don’t have any other options” she said.

In Bartholomew County some single-family homes are renting for similar prices according to listings on Tricon’s website.

For example a 2361-square-foot three-bedroom home in Shadow Creek Farms owned by a Tricon-linked company was renting at $2199 per month as of Friday. The house was bought by a local resident for $219945 in October 2019 and was sold to Tricon’s joint venture this past June for $305000 — $85000 more than the home’s assessed value.

In addition a 1228-square-foot three-bedroom home on the northside of Columbus purchased by a Tricon-linked company was renting at $1499 per month according to Tricon’s website. That same home was purchased by a family for $179000 in April 2021 only to be sold a year later to the joint venture for $240000 local real estate records show.

But despite the price tag to rent these homes Tricon as well as competitors American Homes 4 Rent and Invitation Homes Inc. have reported record occupancy rates since the pandemic hit.

On Wednesday Tricon reported a record 98.3% same-home occupancy rate during the April-June quarter this year according to regulatory filings. The company sees a “significant runway for growth” in the single-home rental market hoping to expand its portfolio to 50000 by the end of 2024 according to the company’s most recent annual report.

“They’re crowding out the people’s ability to buy a home so those people then become renters and they’re often forced into housing that is an increasingly larger portion of what they earn in a given year. It’s pushing people’s housing costs much higher” Coers said. “But they are finding (tenants) because people need a place to live and if they can’t compete in the housing market because there’s just simply not enough supply they become renters and they’re still going to want that same home … but they just have to do it at a substantially higher price point as renters.”

“Even with interest rates rising homeowners would get a substantially better deal if they could buy those houses at what used to be typical market prices and get market financing” Coers said.

Overall concerns

The influx in big investors buying up single-family homes also has raised a number of concerns among housing advocates who say the trend is contributing to rising costs. They argue that the companies are constraining the supply of homes for sale when they buy them and convert them into rentals resulting in increased competition as the same number of buyers vie for the remaining homes on the market.

The Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana and advocacy group Prosperity Indiana say they have seen similar trends in other other communities in Indiana.

“I’ve heard the same story from Evansville to South Bend and now Columbus” said Andrew Bradley policy director of Prosperity Indiana adding that the number of purchases in Bartholomew County has the potential to be “disruptive to neighborhoods and the whole community.”

Amy Nelson executive director of the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana said she has seen a similar trend in Marion County particularly in some Black neighborhoods. Nelson said she believes institutional investors are “playing a role” in rising housing costs though there are a number of other factors at work.

“We were seeing investors coming in purchasing those affordable homes and flipping them over into expensive rentals” Nelson said. “So then people who may normally have been able to purchase those homes and become homeowners lost the ability to do that and had to stay in rentals and very well maybe having to rent those very homes at much higher prices than they could have bought them for.”

Other concerns include that an increase in real estate transactions in a neighborhood could potentially drive up property taxes in the area potentially pricing out some long-term residents Coers said. In addition investors may not have the same level of motivation to care for the home as a homeowner would.

“We see homes depreciate faster experience more physical issues such as maybe they don’t paint the exterior as frequently as a homeowner would have and if (the home) is wood it ages” Coers said. “We see more houses sort of become rundown which can have a negative impact on a neighborhood.”

Tricon did not respond to a request for comment on its operations in Bartholomew County. However the company’s president and CEO Gary Berman has said the rise in housing costs can’t just be pinned on institutional investors telling CBS’s 60 Minutes earlier this year that “corporate landlords represent 2% of all single-family rental housing. So there’s a lot more going on than just corporate landlords bidding up homes. It’s a very competitive and difficult environment.”

However solutions for the current market dynamic are hard to come by Coers said. One one hand “we don’t necessarily want to tell people ‘you can’t sell to somebody and maximize your dollar’” but selling lots of homes investors means fewer and fewer people can be homeowners Coers said.

“When you have more competition for less supply really we have no choice but to build more units to fix that situation but no one can feasibly with today’s cost build a home that matches (the under $300000) price point. So we’re relying on existing housing stock which is aging. I don’t think it’s sustainable but I also don’t see what the solution is.”

“Unless someone can figure out how to build a cheaper home that still serves the market and reaches market utility but can be under that $300000 price point if they can flood the market with those homes maybe we have a chance” Coers said. “But unfortunately they’re flooding them directly into investors’ hands.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9hLWJsYXN0LWZyb20tdGhlLXBhc3Qtc2VlLWluc2lkZS10aGUtbGFzdC1yZW1haW5pbmctYmxvY2tidXN0ZXIv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g4LmNvbS9uZXdzL2EtYmxhc3QtZnJvbS10aGUtcGFzdC1zZWUtaW5zaWRlLXRoZS1sYXN0LXJlbWFpbmluZy1ibG9ja2J1c3Rlci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A blast from the past: See inside the last remaining Blockbuster,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox8.com/news/a-blast-from-the-past-see-inside-the-last-remaining-blockbuster/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9hLWJsYXN0LWZyb20tdGhlLXBhc3Qtc2VlLWluc2lkZS10aGUtbGFzdC1yZW1haW5pbmctYmxvY2tidXN0ZXIv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g4LmNvbS9uZXdzL2EtYmxhc3QtZnJvbS10aGUtcGFzdC1zZWUtaW5zaWRlLXRoZS1sYXN0LXJlbWFpbmluZy1ibG9ja2J1c3Rlci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdHVmZi5jby5uei9idXNpbmVzcy9vcGluaW9uLWFuYWx5c2lzLzEyOTU2NDM1Ny9idWlsZC10by1yZW50LWNoYW5nZXMtYW5kLXByb3ZpZGluZy1hbi1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZS10by1vdmVybGV2ZXJhZ2VkLWJvb21lci1sYW5kbG9yZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Build to rent changes and providing an alternative to over-leveraged 'boomer' landlords,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXlpbmMuY29tL2JpZ2dlc3QtcmVudGFsLWNhci1jb21wYW5pZXMtaW4tdGhlLXdvcmxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 20 Biggest Rental Car Companies in the World in 2022,"From time to time almost everyone needs to rent a car. Perhaps you're going on vacation or maybe your car is in the shop and you have to find transportation for a few days or even a few weeks. It doesn't matter where you go in the world there is always a possibility that you might need to rent a car in order to explore every area that you want to see. The question is what are the biggest car rental companies in the world? Here are twenty of them. Without a doubt you'll be familiar with at least a few companies on this list.

20. ACE Rent a Car (Indianapolis Indiana)

This is undoubtedly the smallest car rental company on the list. They only have a few locations in the United States one of which is their headquarters. While they have a much larger presence in Europe they're nowhere near as big as virtually every other company that rents cars in that part of the world. That being said they're also independently owned. There are companies with better programs out there but if you need to rent a car for a few days and you don't want to spend a fortune to do it there's a better than average chance you can find one right here.

19. Interrent (Ontario Canada)

This is another European company that is sometimes referred to as Goldcar. It's definitely not the largest company in the world but it did manage to crack the top 20. That might be surprising to some as people who have rented cars from them don't typically have a ton of good things to say about the company. In fact most people complain about slow drop-off and pick-up times as well as receiving cars that haven't been thoroughly cleaned.

18. Days Rental (Bridgend South Wales)

This particular car rental company has the distinction of being the largest independently-owned car rental company in Wales. Aside from other major players that operate in multiple countries around the world this little company has made a name for itself. Located in Bridgend the company services all of South Wales. Just in case you're curious they don't just rent cars that you can use for a day trip either. They also have a full van rental program that allows you to rent larger vehicles for groups or even to transport goods and services. Perhaps the best part about the company is that you can rent vehicles by the day or by the week.

17. Rent-A-Wreck of America (Laurel Maryland)

Just as the name implies this car rental service provides cars that have been involved in previous crashes that are now available for rent to the general public. Of course the cars have been repaired to the point that they are drivable even if they're not the most attractive thing on the road. What do you get in return for renting something like this? Their prices are much cheaper when compared to most other car rental companies. As a matter of fact the company was founded on the basis of helping individuals who had bad credit or who simply couldn't afford to rent a car through any other means.

16. U-Save Auto Rental System (Ridgeland Missouri)

This company might be based in Missouri but they actually have hundreds of locations dotted around the world. Most people have the misconception that the company is exclusive to the United States but that isn't necessarily the case. As you can probably already tell from the name they are a discount car rental system that has been in business for a number of decades. In fact they started doing business in 1979 and have been a constant presence ever since.

15. Green Motion (Le Mont-sur-lausanne Switzerland)

This is quickly becoming a mainstay as far as car rental companies in the UK are concerned. The company has been in business since 2007 and it is steadily growing. Again the name says a lot about the company itself. They rent vehicles that have lower emissions than your typical gas-powered automobile. That means renting cars that are fully electric as well as hybrids and those that operate on compressed natural gas. Even though this is still a fairly small niche they currently rent vehicles from virtually every airport and tourist destination within the United Kingdom.

14. Dollar (Estero Florida)

This company is definitely a major player around the world. Even though they're based in Florida they have a major presence in the United Kingdom. However they also have a few odd requirements. For example if you're renting a car in England Wales or Scotland you cannot take that car into Northern Ireland. It's possible to rent a car from the company in Northern Ireland but only if you both rent it from and return it to that particular location. This is largely because Northern Ireland is independent from the rest of the region at least as far as political boundaries are concerned.

13. NP Auto Group (Laurel Maryland)

Most people that rent cars from this particular company have never heard of the parent company itself. That's because the corporation operates under a couple of different franchise names including NextCar and Priceless. They also place a premium on customer satisfaction something that keeps people coming back again and again. As a matter of fact they have one of the most in-depth training programs for any prospective franchise owner out of anyone on this list. They also carefully regulate franchise locations in order to make sure that they aren't cutting corners and that customers are happy with their experiences.

12. Fox Rent A Car (Los Angeles California)

This is a company that started providing rides exclusively from LAX airport in 1989. Eventually they started renting cars from that location and their business slowly expanded from there. Today they are something of a mainstay within the state of California. They also have a presence in certain locations across Europe and the UK especially in larger cities like London.

The company may be based in France but they have locations all over Europe and the United Kingdom. They're not as economically priced as a lot of the other companies on this list but they offer outstanding customer service and a booking process that can be completed online in a matter of minutes. Their cars are always clean and in good working condition something that most people are willing to pay a premium for.

10. Firefly (Estero Florida)

If you're traveling across the UK there's a better than average chance you can find one of their offices without even looking hard. As a matter of fact they have offices in virtually every major city in the entirety of the UK including Wales and Scotland. They also have car rental locations in roughly 21 different countries across the United Kingdom and Europe. Their hook is that you can rent a car of virtually any size and in most cases you'll end up paying a lot less for it than if you went through another company.

9. Avis (Troy Hills New Jersey)

This car rental company has been around since 1946 and in 1953 they started renting cars in various locations around the world. They may be headquartered in New Jersey but there is a better than average chance that you'll be able to find an Avis car rental company in almost any major city no matter where you travel.

8. Sixt (Pullach Germany)

This is easily the largest car rental company in all of Europe. As a matter of fact they have locations all across Europe and in the United Kingdom. They're also the car rental company that undeniably has the best reputation in the entire region. They are well-known for renting late model automobiles of all sizes that are well-kept and extremely clean. They may not offer the cheapest rates but when you consider everything they have to offer (clean reliable vehicles of all types) their rates are more than fair.

The company was once based in Chicago and was founded as far back as 1918. They have somehow managed to stay in the car rental game from that point forward despite having a few crises along the way. On that end of things the COVID-19 pandemic almost spelled doom for the company because people couldn’t travel. However they ultimately survived and continue to operate various locations around the world.

6. Global (Epirus Greece)

Global is definitely one of the foremost rental car companies in the world. Headquartered in Greece they are almost considered something of a superpower in Europe. That being said they also have a number of different locations around the world including in the United States. There are some companies that refer to themselves as being a global company when in fact they only do business in a few select locations. In this particular case the name of the company itself more or less says it all.

5. Thrifty (Estero Florida)

As you can probably already tell by the name this rental car company was founded on the premise that more people would be willing to rent cars if it weren't so expensive. As a result people tended to flock to the company by name alone. It was a marketing ploy that definitely worked and it continues to work to this day. Some people are looking for high-end rental cars when they decide to go on a trip. Others are looking for something that can provide reasonable transportation from one place to another. For those that fall into the latter category this is a company that became well known for providing exactly that a decent rental car at a fair price.

4. National (St. Louis Missouri)

They may have a name that sounds like they only exist within the United States but they do indeed have a global presence. First founded in 1947 this is a car company that has essentially seen it all. Over the years they have dealt with natural disasters significant slumps in the economy and other issues that have definitely caused them to see their own financial difficulties yet they have continued on. Today the company is one of the foremost rental car agencies in the world. They offer a wide variety of cars for rent ranging from the most basic models available to high-end luxury models.

3. Budget (Parsippany New Jersey)

This is not only one of the largest car companies in the world but also one that's probably seen the most change. It was founded in 1958 in Los Angeles California. Years later the company was restructured and moved to New Jersey. At first the company mainly rented automobiles in that particular area. Today they rent cars all over the world. Next to Alamo and Enterprise you're probably more likely to see rental cars available under their banner than virtually anyone else no matter where you're located.

2. Alamo (Clayton Missouri)

Founded in 1974 this is a company that does business across a number of different continents. They not only rent cars in both North and South America but also in Europe Africa and Asia. More recently the company has developed a great deal of popularity in both Oceania and Australia. As is typically the case you can find a wide variety of different types of cars available for rent and the prices are typically in line with other car rental companies.

1. Enterprise (St. Louis Missouri)

Finally here it is. Enterprise car rental is easily the largest company of its type in the entire world. It doesn't matter if you're talking about the United States Canada Europe or the United Kingdom Enterprise has car rental locations everywhere. As a result they rent out more cars than many of the other companies on this list put together."

Now more and more the clock is watching them.

“You’re supposed to be a trusted member of your team but there was never any trust that you were working for the team” she said.

But her first paychecks seemed low. Her new employer which used extensive monitoring software on its all-remote workers paid them only for the minutes when the system detected active work. Worse Ms. Kraemer noticed that the software did not come close to capturing her labor. Offline work — doing math problems on paper reading printouts thinking — didn’t register and required approval as “manual time.” In managing the organization’s finances Ms. Kraemer oversaw more than a dozen people but mentoring them didn’t always leave a digital impression. If she forgot to turn on her time tracker she had to appeal to be paid at all.

A few years ago  Carol Kraemer a longtime finance executive took a new job. Her title senior vice president was impressive. The compensation was excellent: $200 an hour.

But in-person workplaces have embraced the tools as well. Tommy Weir whose company Enaible provides group productivity scores to Fortune 500 companies aims to eventually use individual scores to calibrate pay. “The real question” he said “is which companies are going to use it and when and which companies are going to become irrelevant?”

Some employers are making a trade: “If we’re going to give up on bringing people back to the office we’re not going to give up on managing productivity” said Paul Wartenberg who installs monitoring systems for clients including accounting firms and hospitals.

Tracking they say allows them to manage with newfound clarity fairness and insight. Derelict workers can be rooted out. Industrious ones can be rewarded. “It’s a way to really just focus on the results” rather than impressions said Marisa Goldenberg who ran a division of the company Ms. Kraemer joined and said she used the tools in moderation.

But many employers along with makers of the tracking technology say that even if the details need refining the practice has become valuable — and perhaps inevitable.

As these practices have spread so has resistance to what labor advocates call one of the most significant expansions of employer power in generations. TikTok videos offer tips on outsmarting the systems including with a “mouse jiggler” a device that creates the appearance of activity. (One popular model is called Liberty.) Some of the most closely monitored employees in the country have become some of the most restive — warehouse workers attempting to unionize truckers forming protest convoys.

But two years ago her employer started requiring chaplains to accrue more of what it called “productivity points.” A visit to the dying: as little as one point. Participating in a funeral: one and three-quarters points. A phone call to grieving relatives: one-quarter point.

Each morning Ms. Richardson and her colleagues had to project how many “productivity points” they would accumulate during the day’s work. But death defied planning .

Allina Health The Rev. Margo Richardson Hospice chaplain Each morning Ms. Richardson and her colleagues had to project how many “productivity points” they would accumulate during the day’s work. But death defied planning . Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times

The metrics are even applied to spiritual care for the dying. The Rev. Margo Richardson of Minneapolis became a hospice chaplain to help patients wrestle with deep searching questions. “This is the big test for everyone: How am I going to face my own death?” she said.

“We’re in this era of measurement but we don’t know what we should be measuring” said Ryan Fuller former vice president for workplace intelligence at Microsoft.

UnitedHealth social workers were marked idle for lack of keyboard activity while counseling patients in drug treatment facilities according to a former supervisor. Grocery cashiers said the pressure to quickly scan items degraded customer service making it harder to be patient with elderly shoppers who move slowly. Ms. Kraemer the executive said she sometimes resorted to doing “busywork that is mindless” to accumulate clicks.

But the most urgent complaint spanning industries and incomes is that the working world’s new clocks are just wrong: inept at capturing offline activity unreliable at assessing hard-to-quantify tasks and prone to undermining the work itself.

Ms. Polney’s keyboard activity was closely monitored when she worked for a division of UnitedHealth Group. She sometimes accrued “idle time” while discussing cases with colleagues affecting her chances of getting bonuses and promotions.

Architects academic administrators doctors nursing home workers and lawyers described growing electronic surveillance over every minute of their workday. They echoed complaints that employees in many lower-paid positions have voiced for years: that their jobs are relentless that they don’t have control — and in some cases that they don’t even have enough time to use the bathroom. In interviews and in hundreds of written submissions to The Times white-collar workers described being tracked as “demoralizing” “humiliating” and “toxic.” Micromanagement is becoming standard they said.

Some radiologists see scoreboards showing their “inactivity” time and how their productivity stacks up against their colleagues’. At companies including J.P. Morgan tracking how employees spend their days from making phone calls to composing emails has become routine practice. In Britain Barclays Bank scrapped prodding messages to workers like “Not enough time in the Zone yesterday” after they caused an uproar. At UnitedHealth Group low keyboard activity can affect compensation and sap bonuses. Public servants are tracked too: In June New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority told engineers and other employees they could work remotely one day a week if they agreed to full-time productivity monitoring.

Now digital productivity monitoring is also spreading among white-collar jobs and roles that require graduate degrees. Many employees whether working remotely or in person are subject to trackers scores “idle” buttons or just quiet constantly accumulating records. Pauses can lead to penalties from lost pay to lost jobs.

In lower-paying jobs  the monitoring is already ubiquitous: not just at Amazon  where the second-by-second measurements became notorious but also for Kroger cashiers UPS drivers and millions of others. Eight of the 10 largest private U.S. employers track the productivity metrics of individual workers many in real time according to an examination by The New York Times.

Captured on Camera

Ms. Kraemer the finance executive thought she had seen it all. Years after working at Enron the energy giant turned business blowup she and former colleagues still held reunions to commemorate what they had been through. But she had never encountered anything like the practices of ESW Capital a Texas-based group of business software companies.

She and her co-workers could turn off their trackers and take breaks anytime as long as they hit 40 hours a week which the company logged in 10-minute chunks. During each of those intervals at some moment they could never anticipate cameras snapped shots of their faces and screens creating timecards to verify whether they were working. Some bosses allowed a few “bad” timecards — showing interruptions or no digital activity — according to interviews with two dozen current and former employees. Beyond that any snapshot in which they had paused or momentarily stepped away could cost them 10 minutes of pay. Sometimes those cards were rejected; sometimes the workers knowing the rules didn’t submit them at all.

While the tracker was on “you couldn’t choose those bathroom or coffee moments — you just had to wing it” she said.

Though Ms. Kraemer didn’t know it that software had been created with a sense of promise about the future of the workplace.

It was part of a bold plan for streamlining and “redefining the way people work” as one of the creators put it. Office settings were choked with unnecessary interruptions they believed and constrained by geography from hiring the best talent worldwide. Smartphones and their constant pings were a growing threat to concentration.

If technology could optimize productivity everyone would benefit the executives said. The company would accomplish more. Workers would perform better then log off to live their lives.

To carry out this vision ESW deployed a firm called Crossover founded in 2014 to hire and manage workers. Wages were high and benefits sparse: Nearly everyone would be contractors using their own computers. The executives adapted an existing tracker into WorkSmart the software that placed Ms. Kraemer and others under a dome of electronic supervision.

The system drew adherents because the productivity gains were remarkable. Goofing off was excised. In interviews former supervisors described having newfound powers of near X-ray vision into what employees were doing other than working: watching porn playing video games using bots to mimic typing two-timing Crossover by programming for other businesses and subcontracting their assignments out to lower-paid workers.

Other employees they said became more efficient. “Once you see those metrics those insights something changes: You realize how much you waste doing nothing or just multitasking and not accomplishing stuff” said Federico Mazzoli a co-creator of WorkSmart. Some overseas workers said the intrusions were worth the U.S. salaries that enabled them to buy homes or start businesses.

Crossover Federico Mazzoli Product Manager Mr. Mazzoli helped create software used to monitor white-collar workers and pay them only for the minutes they were actively working. He later questioned the accuracy of his creation and called it dangerous. Tali Kimelman for The New York Times

But Ms. Kraemer like many of her colleagues found that WorkSmart upended ideas she had taken for granted: that she would have more freedom in her home than at an office; that her M.B.A. and experience had earned her more say over her time.

Workdays grew longer for her and others in part because offline work didn’t count but also because it was nearly impossible to work online with unwavering focus. Taking time to mull or bantering with colleagues turned out to be necessary to both doing her job and getting through the day even if those moments went unpaid.

“You have to be in front of your computer in work mode 55 or 60 hours just to get those 40 hours counted and paid for” Ms. Kraemer said. Though WorkSmart allowed payment requests for offline work employees said managers did not always encourage them. (Executives from ESW and Crossover did not reply to repeated requests for comment including written questions about whether any of these practices have since been updated. But Crossover defends its practices on its website saying that its “‘Fitbit’ of productivity” spurs motivation accountability and “remote freedoms.”)

Two years after helping to build WorkSmart Mr. Mazzoli started using it. He became awash in anxiety and doubtful about its accuracy. “Some days you were just moving the cursor around just for the sake of it” he said. The tool was powerful but dangerous he concluded. (He left the company a year later.)

Crossover’s reputation as an employer began to slide with online reviews that warned against working there. The company heard so many complaints about the camera trained on each worker that they removed it as a default feature according to Mr. Mazzoli. Ms. Kraemer left ESW and sued Crossover for unpaid wages for work that its system didn’t track. The case was settled for an amount she is barred from disclosing.

But WorkSmart’s creators had adopted an idea that was going mainstream. Human resources once reliant on more subjective assessments was becoming more of an analytics business. Employers had always sought to get the most out of employees and some fields had long recorded billable client hours but this was different. “The people data revolution predicted for years has finally arrived” proclaimed a 2018 Deloitte report.

Software makers competed to deliver employee ratings app-activity reports and color-coded charts showing who was doing what. Even software that wasn’t designed for productivity surveillance contributed to it. Microsoft Teams introduced in 2017 and taken up by hundreds of millions of people signaled which users were “active” (green dot) or “away” (yellow). Salesforce the leading marketing sales and customer service program logged emails sent and phone calls made to customers. At financial firms monitoring software set up for compliance reasons also served up insights on how employees spent their time.

Upwork a freelance marketplace now used by podcast producers accountants and hundreds of thousands of other skilled workers offered a time-tracking feature similar to WorkSmart’s that took screenshots during every 10-minute billing window. (This is no coincidence: The tracker that inspired WorkSmart is now part of Upwork.) Freelancers could try to explain screenshots showing moments of inactivity but as with WorkSmart some said they submitted only the unblemished ones in effect forgoing pay for some of their labor.

Union Test Prep Dora Potts Editor in Chief Ms. Potts said she was in favor of the screenshots that Upwork a freelancer marketplace took at random intervals during her work for a testing preparation service. “It keeps you honest” she said. Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times

The arrival of the pandemic spurring businesses to keep tabs on workers at home hastened a shift that was already underway. As more employers adopted the tools more workers shared Ms. Kraemer’s experience: The software was warping the foundations of time and trust in their work lives.

In the spring of 2020 Patrick Baratta graduated from the University of Virginia and began working remotely for AlphaBrook which provides research on government contracting. Soon the company began gauging its workers’ productivity using a program called Monitask according to Mr. Baratta and several former colleagues.

Once he said a manager asked why his score had dropped during a particular 10-minute increment. “Sometimes I have to use the bathroom” he replied. (Matthew Hastings AlphaBrook’s founder and chief executive said the company “would never assess an employee over just 10 minutes of their time.”) In interviews and written submissions to The Times workers across a variety of jobs — pharmaceutical assistants insurance underwriters employees of e-commerce companies — also said productivity pressure had led to problems with bathroom breaks.

Some companies that adopted monitoring tools during the Covid-19 shutdown maintained them even after returning to work in person. CoStar Group a Washington-based real estate data company where a friend of Mr. Baratta took a job continued keeping intricate records of how employees spend their time. (One report viewed by The Times had over 20 entries in a single hour of an employee’s day.) CoStar said that those numbers were not used as stand-alone tools and that a better measurement was the monthly rankings of individual employee output displayed on screens in the office.

Larger more established companies are taking similar steps. UnitedHealth Group has 350000 employees a perch high on the Fortune 500 list and annual revenues of hundreds of billions of dollars. It also has strict systems for measuring “idle time” that some employees say are deeply flawed.

Jessica Hornig a Rhode Island social worker who supervised two dozen other UnitedHealthcare social workers and therapists seeing patients with drug addiction and other serious problems said their laptops marked them “idle” when they ceased keyboard activity for more than a short while. They were labeled derelict during sensitive conversations with patients and visits to drug treatment facilities.

“This literally killed morale” Ms. Hornig said. “I found myself really struggling to explain to all my team members master’s-level clinicians why we were counting their keystrokes.”

In recent years she said the scores have become even more consequential: On performance evaluations social workers were rated 1 to 5 based on the amount of time they were digitally engaged — numbers that affected compensation. Ms. Hornig said her team spent hours each week piecing together alternate records but had trouble keeping up without compromising core parts of their job.

Other UnitedHealth employees described similar problems. For Linda Eusebi who works on insurance letters from her home in Garden Grove Calif. compensation is tied to “idle time.” At the end of the workday when her company-issued computer is shutting down it sometimes gets stuck in “idle” mode all night throwing off her numbers. (She said her managers aware of the problems but unable to fix them began reminding her and others to jiggle their mice during meetings and training sessions.)

Isaac Sorensen a spokesman for Optum a division of UnitedHealth Group acknowledged that the company monitored employees but declined to say how many and said it considered several factors in evaluations. “We know there is no single measure to fully assess team productivity or individual performance” he said.

For frustrated employees or for companies navigating what to disclose to workers or how to deploy metrics in pay or firing decisions the law provides little guidance. In many states employers have “carte blanche in how to implement these technologies to surveil workers” said Ifeoma Ajunwa a law professor at the University of North Carolina.

ESW Capital Ritu Chaturvedi Vice President of Marketing Ms. Chatuvedi said she was unfazed by heavy tracking including screenshots taken throughout the day . “There are people who are honest and people who are not and there’s no way to tell the difference” she said. Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times

Many of today’s workplace regulations including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 were written long before “bottom performer” dashboard displays were conceivable. A New York law that took effect this spring requires employers to disclose the type of information they collect. But efforts to enact a similar rule in California stalled amid opposition from business groups.

“The technology is just growing and improving so quickly” said Brian Kropp the chief of research for Gartner’s human resources practice. “It’s moving faster than employees realize it is and a whole lot faster than government can regulate it.” Investment in new workplace technologies has been soaring according to Jason Corsello a venture capitalist who called “performance management” one of the fastest-growing categories with an eightfold increase in funding in the last five years.

But the march toward ever-tighter monitoring is also encountering some limits. Some companies have rejected the approach outright and earlier this year Amazon quietly eased back on the best-known and most criticized productivity metric in the American workplace.

For years Amazon’s “time off task” policy recorded warehouse workers’ every pause and resulted in the firing of highly praised employees after one bad day. With unionization efforts underway on Staten Island and new California regulations on warehouse metrics Amazon reformulated its rules. The company still calculates every worker’s “rate” or pace. But the term “time off task” has been retired according to Kelly Nantel a spokeswoman and managers have been directed to look only into “idle” periods longer than 15 minutes. The updated rules she said are meant to recognize that employees may need to confer with a colleague or spend a few extra minutes in the restroom — in other words to better reflect people’s natural behavior and cadences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNC9yZXR1cm4tdG8tb2ZmaWNlLXBvbGljaWVzLXRvcC0xMC1mb3J0dW5lLTUwMC1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The return-to-office policies of the top 10 Fortune 500 companies,"Hybrid work is winning at the top 10 Fortune 500 companies.

Most have yet to implement an official remote-only or in-person-only strategy instead easing hesitant workers back into the office with a hybrid policy. But many have been operating in a tale of two cities forcing retail workers back to the frontlines a year before requiring corporate employees to return to the office.

From Walmart to Amazon here’s a breakdown of the top 10 Fortune 500’s return-to-office policies.

1. Walmart

Walmart’s retail workers referred to as in-house associates worked through the pandemic while its corporate workers worked from home for over a year. Walmart released a company memo in October 2021 stating that corporate employees would transition to coming into the office on a “more regular basis” in November.

But Walmart’s 10000 tech employees were excluded from the decision; the company announced in May 2020 that this largely Silicon Valley-based group could work remotely indefinitely as the pandemic waned.

A spokesperson for the company tells Fortune campus-office associates have been coming into the office more regularly since February. In a February email Walmart provided to Fortune Donna Morris chief people officer said it’s the company’s intention to create a collaborative environment on campus while working toward more flexibility.

“Our ways of working will vary across teams” she wrote. “We believe it’s important that we aren’t overly prescriptive and in the nature of flexibility we all need to be open to ambiguity. We will not mandate in and out of office days or start and finish times.”

She left it open to bosses to decide what meetings can be attended in-person and on-campus but added that the company believes “it’s important to be together in our offices the majority of the time” writing that Walmart’s culture leadership relationship building and creativity all benefit when workers are together.

2. Amazon

Amazon delivery and warehouse workers continued to provide goods throughout lockdown reportedly dealing with grueling conditions while corporate employees worked from home. In October 2021 Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained in a company memo that Amazon continues to be in “a stage of experimenting learning and adjusting for a while as we emerge from this pandemic.”

In said company memo which Amazon referred Fortune to when asked for comment Jassy allows directors on individual teams to decide how many days their reports should come into the office. Jassy maintained that the company is flexible but that Amazon workers should live close enough to their office to come in within a day’s notice.

In September Jassy made it clear that Amazon isn’t looking to push an office mandate any time soon. “We don’t have a plan to require people to come back. We don’t right now. But we’re going to proceed adaptively as we learn” he said.

3. Apple

CEO Tim Cook has pushed corporate employees slowly back to the office under a hybrid model.

“For many of you I know that returning to the office represents a long-awaited milestone and a positive sign that we can engage more fully with the colleagues who play such an important role in our lives” Cook said. “For others it may also be an unsettling change.”

Employees were asked to come into the office beginning April 11th reaching a minimum of three in-person days by March 23rd. Many employees (about 76%) were dissatisfied and 56% reported that they were looking to quit.

Though Cook’s previous plans were thwarted by another round of COVID-19 infections Apple recently announced employees should save the date to come in three times a week starting September 5th.

Meanwhile Apple retail employees have been unionizing for better working conditions. It’s working: Apple agreed to make work schedules at all of its retail stores more flexible.

Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

4. CVS Health

Many pharmacists and other retail workers stayed in stores during the pandemic to take care of customers’ increasing medical needs says Erin Britt director of corporate communications at CVS Health.

Corporate employees were ushered back to the office starting March 15th. “As part of our new hybrid work format most corporate employees are spending two to three days each week at one of our office locations and working virtually on the other days” Britt tells Fortune.

5. UnitedHealth Group

UnitedHealth Group has implemented all three work models: “hybrid fully telecommute and core on-site” with an emphasis on flexible work according to an official statement the company sent Fortune.

The healthcare and insurance company pointed out that they’ve always had both remote and on-site employees but the bulk of workers right now are mostly hybrid.

“The hybrid model will apply to many of our traditionally office-based employees who will now average about three days per week in the office” reads the statement. “The hybrid model is flexible and based on manager discretion.”

6. Exxon Mobil

On-site employees seemingly remained working in person through the pandemic; in March 2020 an article on the company’s site read “For those employees whose work requires them to be at one of our facilities we have put additional safety measures in place.”

Employees based in Houston (where Exxon plans to move its headquarters to next year) were expected to return to office five days a week starting mid-May of 2021 according to Bloomberg.

“Most of our Houston-campus employees are back in the office while continuing to benefit from our workplace flexibility programs” Todd Spitler Corporate Media Relations Senior Advisor tells Fortune. He adds that while the company believes that “business is best run from our offices and workplaces” there are workforce flexibility programs that can be approved by a supervisor.

7. Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett was one of the first leaders to publicly question if people would ever return to the office after the pandemic. Charlie Munger vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway continued Buffett’s sentiment in February 2022 saying that a large portion of workers who would rather not be in the office would remain that way forever.

There’s no public official statement on the company’s policy but when Fortune called headquarters an administrative worker revealed that each branch is making its own decisions with HR on whether employees will return to office.

8. Alphabet

Alphabet’s subsidiary Google is bringing corporate workers back to headquarters on a hybrid schedule.

Google’s corporate employees were expected to return to the office three days a week starting April 2022. A representative informed Fortune that the decision was made in light of employee feedback. But there’s still room for flexibility as “employees who need more time before returning can also request a work-from-home extension.”

Feedback on the corporate roll-out of return to office varied based on the employee but the company has received backlash for its pay adjustments based on where remote workers are located.

But Google’s extended workforce—which includes vendors and temporary staff who work on short-term projects—was compensated for time spent off explains a representative to Fortune: “Throughout the pandemic members of our extended workforce who were affected by reduced office schedules and closures were compensated for the time they would have worked.”

9. McKesson

McKesson’s frontline healthcare workers continued to work during the pandemic. “During the midst of a pandemic thousands of Team McKesson members continue to work every day in order to deliver vital medical products to the frontline in the fight against COVID-19” its website reads.

An Indeed poll of about 4000 McKesson employees found that 61% said they could work remotely. As of now the company has advertised both remote and in-person positions. Reviews on Glassdoor from employees emphasize the company’s flexibility; one from March 2022 says “employs an office as a destination approach where you go to the office to collaborate but perform your duties remotely.”

McKesson did not respond to requests for comment.

10. AmerisourceBergen

The drug wholesale company is “working under a hybrid model called the ‘Work Smart Platform’ meaning that team members are encouraged to work from home and come into the office when they desire” spokeswoman Mackenzie Liberatori told The Mercury in October 2021.

AmerisourceBergen didn’t provide Fortune with details on its return-to-office policies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8va2Zvci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9vdS1oZWFsdGgtdW5pdGVkaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1yZWFjaC1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtb24tcHJvY2Vzc2luZy1jbGFpbXMv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9rZm9yLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL291LWhlYWx0aC11bml0ZWRoZWFsdGhjYXJlLXJlYWNoLWFncmVlbWVudC1vbi1wcm9jZXNzaW5nLWNsYWltcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OU Health UnitedHealthcare reach agreement on processing claims,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://kfor.com/news/local/ou-health-unitedhealthcare-reach-agreement-on-processing-claims/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8va2Zvci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9vdS1oZWFsdGgtdW5pdGVkaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1yZWFjaC1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtb24tcHJvY2Vzc2luZy1jbGFpbXMv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9rZm9yLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL291LWhlYWx0aC11bml0ZWRoZWFsdGhjYXJlLXJlYWNoLWFncmVlbWVudC1vbi1wcm9jZXNzaW5nLWNsYWltcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

A country of 1.3 billion people but India spends barely 1.5% of its GDP on healthcare which is amongst the lowest in the world.

In June 2021 NITI Aayog launched a report on ‘Health Insurance for India’s Missing Middle’ claims that ~30% of the population are devoid of any financial protection for health. According to the report The Ayushman Bharat scheme covers ~50% of the population. Around 20% of the population is covered under social health insurance and private voluntary health insurance. The remaining 30% of the population lacks any financial backing for healthcare treatment – this segment is termed the ‘missing middle’ because they are not poor enough to be covered by government-subsidized schemes but not rich enough to afford private health insurance. However the actual number of uncovered individuals is much higher due to the existing coverage gap in the Ayushman Bharat scheme.

The country has made strides toward Universal Health Coverage with the launch of the ‘Ayushman Bharat’ Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya scheme in September 2018. The scheme is considered to be the largest fully government-subsidized scheme in the world covering ~50% of the country’s population. The scheme caters to 10.9 crore families or 49 crore individuals that are categorized in the Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011. The Ayushman Bharat scheme offers subsidized healthcare packages with annual coverage of Rs.5 lakhs per family on a floater basis. As the scheme is limited to covering ~50% of India’s population at the bottom of the pyramid an average Indian middle class continues to struggle to access healthcare treatment.

The outbreak of the pandemic has cracked open the gap which requires immediate attention.

Lack of infrastructure

The epidemic showed that the Indian healthcare system is not ready for any catastrophic events similar to COVID. The government’s spending on healthcare the gap in demand and supply and chronic shortages are some of the concerns that need urgent attention. Data suggests that India has 1.4 beds per 1000 people 1 doctor per 1445 people and 1.7 nurses per 1000 people.

The disparity in the Rural-Urban healthcare system

Over 75% of the healthcare infrastructure is concentrated in metro cities where only 27% of the total population resides—the rest 73% of the Indian population lack even basic medical facilities. The primary medical centers are lacking over 3000 doctors and in the last decade the shortage has increased by ~200%. Quality healthcare treatment can be found in the urban areas but often the person from a rural part of the country cannot afford to come to the metro cities for the treatment.

Lack of trained and skilled resources

One of the most critical concerns is the gap in the doctor-patient ratio. According to the Indian Journal of Public Health India needs 2070000 doctors by 2030. However a doctor in the government hospital attends to ~11000 patients which is more than the WHO recommendation of 1:1000.

Expensive healthcare treatment

Medical procedures similar to cancer treatment transplants and critical ails bear immediate attention. Overburdened government hospitals often delay in offering timely treatment which diverts individuals to seek medical care in the costlier private hospitals. Even though The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) directed all health insurance companies to offer obligatory Arogya Sanjeevani policies in April 2020. The policy will provide coverage up to Rs 5 lakh – 10 lakhs for essential healthcare treatment but the policy is not sufficient to cover advanced treatments transplants and critical surgeries.

High out-of-pocket expenses

Indians pay ~63% of their medical expenses out-of-pocket which is considered to be the highest in the world. A report from Brookings India based on NSSO surveys claims that ~7% of India’s population is pushed into poverty every year due to healthcare expenses.

Today medical crowdfunding has emerged as an alternative financing option for India’s missing middle. In India it is common for people to be drained of all life’s savings while trying to meet medical emergencies. often even without the promise of recovery leaving caretakers grasping at straws to stay afloat. Medical crowdfunding is an avenue for individuals to reach out to people and seek financial support. The crowdfunding platforms use state-of-the-art technology to enable a seamless fundraising process. With the advent of technology the process of donation has become easy and transparent. However the Indian crowdfunding industry has just scratched the surface and experts see sizeable potential in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. With the right awareness campaigns collaborations and education drives we believe we can bring significant change in people’s lives in the rural part of the country too.

Dr. Adam Hofmann co-founder of Algomed says he's a strong advocate for public health care but says Canada's strained system can't meet the needs of citizens.

""We can't stand by anymore while people are dying literally dying because they don't have family doctors"" Hofmann said. ""If you're talking about a universal public health-care system it is neither universal nor public not free if you can't access it.""

According to a survey from Statistics Canada almost half of adults across Canada's 10 provinces had difficulty accessing health care in 2020 and 2021. About 15 per cent said they didn't receive the care they needed at all.

Critic of private health care

The Nova Scotia Health Coalition advocates for equitable access to health care and is against privatization.

Alexandra Rose the coalition's provincial co-ordinator says while private care might provide a temporary solution it makes the shortfalls in Canada's public health-care system even worse.

""Every time a private clinic opens doctors leave the public sector doctors nurses nurse practitioners. That's less staff working in the public sector which is only going to exacerbate the extreme staffing crisis that we're already facing"" Rose said.

The Algomed clinic is staffed by three nurses who specialize in primary care according to Hofmann.

Hofmann says Algomed focuses on employing nurses — rather than doctors — allowing them to see thousands more patients each year compared to public clinics.

While the Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness declined an interview they did provide a statement saying they are aware of this clinic and are working to determine the impact that private medical facilities will have on Nova Scotians and the health-care system.

How does Algomed work?

Algomed is a subscription service in which clients pay $22 per month to become a member and then pay $20 for every visit to the clinic.

At an appointment patients are seen by a nurse specializing in primary care. The nurse is supervised by nurse practitioners and doctors who work with them to provide care including annual checkups prescriptions and specialist referrals.

Any care the clinic cannot provide is referred back to the public health-care system.

The clinic which has only been active for a few months currently has about four dozen subscribers.

Algomed is not the first private clinic to open in the area. The Unified Health Community Centre opened in west-end Halifax in August 2018. CBC News has been unable to contact any person from the clinic for this story.

Same issues different solutions

Both Hofmann and Rose agree on the problems that exist within Canada's public health-care system but they disagree on the best way to tackle them.

Hofmann says he's taken the problem into his own hands because public health care has its limitations.

""What public health care does badly is adapt to the times. It doesn't innovate. It cannot innovate. It is too big a battleship to turn around"" said Hofmann.

Rose says the responsibility to solve systemic issues lands on the shoulders of the government. She says she's worried private care will dissuade the government from finding long-term solutions on their own.

Thailand’s health care for women at government medical facilities is free of charge and quite comprehensive. The problem is that a lot of people are unaware that there are such services available for free said Dr. Phanitra Maneeratprasert Gynaecologist at Bang Bua Thong Hospital in Nonthaburi province.

The women’s clinic at this hospital is one of over 130 service points available in Nonthaburi providing women with the health care services they need ranging from reproductive health and maternity care to breast and cervical cancer screening. In fact it is one of over 7000 facilities nationwide that provide such care.

Anyone who holds the Universal Health Care card can access these services.

For Lamai Yodmahalabkul a 55-year-old housewife it is the first time she has visited this hospital and she is already impressed. She was there for cervical cancer screening. She was told that they have free HPV-DNA cervical screening tests available here every Thursday and it is different from the one usually included in the annual health check. “For this one the doctor said the result is good for 5 years” she told Thai PBS World.

Sita Sumleemuang a 23-year-old mother-to-be is at the women’s clinic for a maternity check-up. She lives in the neighborhood and has been coming to this hospital since she was a child.

This is Sita’s second pregnancy. She does not know how far along she is yet. The nurse said judging from the size she could be 5 months pregnant but they will know for sure at the next appointment only a few days from now.

There are 12 nurses and 2 doctors working at this clinic. There could be up to 30 patients visiting for maternity care each day and another 10 to 30 patients for other women’s health care services. In some cases however the patient only needs to see nurses who specialize in certain services.

Dr. Phanitra said that in addition to maternity care they offer other outpatient gynecological services.

“There are also free screening tests. We have screening for cervical and breast cancers. It’s available here every Thursday for half the morning. It is the HPV-DNA cervical screening test. It is a new kind of test. It used to be the Pap smear test which can only detect cancer cells when there’s already an abnormality in the area of the cervix” Dr. Phanitra added.

Dr. Phanitra has been working here since graduating from medical school 3 years ago. She decided to enter this field because when she first experienced the moment of a woman giving birth during her student years she felt delighted and impressed and wanted to be a part of those moments.

Dr. Phanitra said the hospital can provide quite comprehensive health services. The issues mostly are that some patients just do not want to come in even when she assures them that the service is free.

“It is the patients. Some of them say they are too busy with work or they don’t know they are pregnant. It delays the (provision of) maternity care. So instead of getting prenatal supplements they don’t get any. Some show up for the first time when they are over 30 weeks into their pregnancy. Some show up when they are very close to their due date. Some don’t even show up until they are actually giving birth” she added.

A specialist in women’s health from Thailand’s Medical Council Dr. Olarik Musigavong said that sexual and reproductive health services in Thailand have been improving for the past 20 years. What remains problematic however is the awareness of such services including accessibility and affordability for different groups of patients.

Dr. Olarik explained that the main issues are that many are unaware of their rights or what services are available for them. Many forms of essential care are free of charge but not everything.

While providing an update on the current status of the state’s health care services Health and Wellness Minister Moses Jn. Baptiste said ‘health financing’ remains a major concern for the authorities as they seek measures to help remedy this situation.

Toward this end he said government is taking steps to initiate a Health Fund and a Roving Health Team to help address and better manage the myriad of problems in the health sector.

Speaking to reporters outside parliament this week the health minister said over the years the country has experienced various forms of ‘crises’ in the health sector.

Jn. Baptiste noted that government also has to deal with the crucial issue of accessing or sourcing the required number of professionals and qualified nurses; since adequate financing is not readily available for the authorities to fully deal with this matter.

“It is very clear that for a while we have not financed health in the way which we should” declared J. Baptiste.

“So I think one of the first steps is for us to continue to look at what is required. There are several studies that we have been looking at … and now that we’re back in government we are now implementing some of the recommendations that have been around for a very long time” he added.

“So it’s very clear that health care financing is one of the main issues because you clearly cannot run a hospital complex if you don’t have adequate financing” Jn. Baptiste said.

He added “You can’t run the St Jude Hospital or even primary care …you need at least a minimum level of financing to do that and we are working we are trying to see how best we can get the best model for financing health care.”

Noting the dire need for better health care services and aid to assist the less privileged in the community the minister disclosed that cabinet has agreed to establish a Health Fund. He said this Fund will help support the proposed universal health care initiative.

In an effort to bring solace to citizens in dealing with the country’s ‘health blues’ Jn. Baptiste added: “And that’s another aspect …but even before this comes on stream there are certain things that must be done now. Over the last few months we have initiated a Roving Health Team of professionals …and they are going around all of what we traditionally call our health centers they are going around the country to determine what are the basic things the basic processes basic pieces of equipment that are missing. Over the last few months we have improved the conditions and also the procedures and the processes at several of our primary health care facilities.”

The major components in focus he said include Health care financing “and we would need a national response to this”. Secondly he added “how do we adequately resource our health care facilities in terms of human resources doctors nurses the professionals and so and then how do we deal with what we have now.”

Bearing in mind that the authorities have had to take on the added role of combatting the COVID-19 virus and its related consequences Jn. Baptiste said it is a serious problem that must be tackled head-on.

He said government is looking at the various problems as it relates to the OKEU Hospital the St Jude Hospital and other factors. “We have received the complaints and we are hearing the cries from the public and we are listening and we are taking action” he added.

In the wider context and with the Organization of Eastern Caribbean Sates (OECS) moving towards putting a ‘cap’ on the price of medicinal supplies in the sub-region will such a development help with more equitable provision of health care?

The minister explained that the OECS deals with medication and the procurement of medication as a unit though some countries still procure medication individually for certain aspects or certain areas.

However the OECS has the authority to oversee components such as; the Procurement Process “which is dealt with as an OECS region and all of the decisions come out of that”.

He explained “They negotiate prices together and sometimes when the prices go up they find strategies to see how we can get the best prices for our people.”

Jn. Baptiste adds that “They always work together to come up with the best prices …but we don’t do so as an individual unit we work together with the OECS.”"

El anuncio se produce más de dos años después de que el gigante sanitario le ponga fin a las ventas del producto en los Estados Unidos.

La empresa enfrenta cerca de 38.000 demandas de mujeres que alegan que el producto contenía asbesto y que provocó que desarrollaran cáncer de ovario. No obstante ellos expresaron su opinión de que es seguro de usar.

“Como parte de una evaluación de la cartera de productos en todo el mundo tomamos la decisión comercial de pasar a una cartera de polvos para bebés exclusivamente a base de almidón de maíz” anunció la firma a través de un comunicado.

El comunicado completo de Johnson & Johnson Johnson & Johnson

Nada que temer

Nuevamente J & J reafirmó su posición de que su talco para bebés es seguro de usar y para eso apeló a “las décadas de análisis científicos independientes realizados por expertos médicos de todo el mundo que confirman que los polvos para bebés son seguros no contienen asbesto y no provocan cáncer”.

En 2020 la firma anunció que dejaría de vender este producto en los Estados Unidos y Canadá. Entre las razones afirmaron que la caída de la demanda en el producto se provocó por una “información errónea” sobre su seguridad.

Sin embargo en aquel entonces dijeron que seguirían vendiendo sus polvos de talco para bebés en el resto del mundo. En la actualidad enfrentan demandas de consumidores que aseguran que su producto les provocó cáncer debido a la contaminación con amianto.

La otra versión

El talco es un mineral arcilloso compuesto de magnesio hidratado que se extrae de la tierra y se encuentra en vetas cercanas a la del asbesto o amianto que es un material conocido por causar cáncer.

En 2018 la agencia de noticias Reuters publicó una investigación en la que afirmó que J & sabía desde hacía décadas que el amianto estaba presente en su talco. Asimismo dijeron que los registros internos de la compañía los testimonios de los juicios y otras pruebas mostraron que al menos desde 1971 hasta principios del 2000 el talco crudo y los polvos terminados de J & a veces dieron positivo en pequeñas cantidades de amianto.

Pese a las evidencias la empresa negó repetidamente las acusaciones. En octubre J & creó una filial LTL Management a la que asignó la tarea de lidiar con las reclamaciones por talco. Más tarde la puso en quiebra lo cual paralizó las demandas pendientes.

Antes de la declaración de quiebra la empresa tuvo que hacer frente a los costes derivados de condenas y acuerdos extrajudiciales por valor de US$ 3.500 millones incluido uno en el que 22 mujeres recibieron una sentencia de más de 2.000 millones.

En abril fracasó una propuesta de los accionistas que pedía el fin de las ventas mundiales de los polvos de talco para bebés. Johnson’s Baby Powder se vende desde hace casi 130 años y se convirtió en un símbolo de la empresa como garante del bienestar familiar no obstante en la actualidad se ven envueltos en una polémica de gran magnitud.

Not likely: Earlier this year telecommunications giant AT&T announced that it would continue to expand its multi-gig capabilities within its full fiber-to-the-premise (FTTP) footprint which utilizes fiber optics all the way to the end-user premises with specialized equipment designed and optimized for use in residential applications. The service is available in more than 70 U.S. markets

Ziply Fiber has followed by rolling out 2-Gig and 5-Gig speed tiers in parts of Washington Oregon and Idaho.

Verizon has also announced that it would offer its own plans with download and upload speeds of up to 2.3 gigabits per second. The catch is that this is only for “select areas” of the New York City market where it will be available to those who have access to Verizon Fios the company’s 100 percent fiber optic Internet service which is now offered in eight northeastern states and the District of Columbia. Currently there are three plans for those markets including Fios 300 (300 megabits per second download and upload speeds) Fios 500 (500 Mbit/s download upload) and Fios Gigabit (940 Mbit/s download 880 Mbit/s upload).

Customers in the Big Apple will be able to take advantage of the Fios 2 Gigabit Connection which reportedly offers download and upload speeds between 1.5 and 2.3 gigabits per second. The service is currently priced at $120 per month which includes router rental a Wi-Fi extender (at no extra charge) and 2 terabytes of cloud storage.

Verizon certainly seems to be betting on broadband even as it has been steadily losing pay-TV subscribers. At the start of 2022 it was announced that the company had reportedly lost nearly 68000 in the third quarter of 2021 and an additional 69000 in the fourth quarter. It began 2022 with about 3.6 million subscribers to Fios.

Going Both Ways

What is notable about Verizon’s Fios is that it is about both downloads and uploads.

“A properly designed and provisioned fiber network is inherently symmetrical – upload speeds will be the same as download speeds. It also has a tremendous amount of capacity compared to DSL (i.e. standard telco) or DOCSIS (i.e. cable modem) systems” explained Steve Blum founder and president of consulting firm Tellus Venture Associates.

“So it’s easy to provide 2 Gbps up/down to customers at a negligible cost to the ISP” Blum told 19FortyFive. “I live in Reno now and have AT&T fiber service. The terminal they installed in my garage is capable of handling 5 Gbps. It’s just the way fiber equipment is made. Selling customers 1 Gbps or 2 Gbps or more is like when McDonald’s offers to supersize your drink for 10 cents: nine plus cents of that is pure profit.”

For those reasons fiber optics could very much be the future for the delivery of Internet services.

“AT&T is netting a bigger operating profit from me now because once built a fiber network is cheaper to run than a decaying overstressed high maintenance copper network” Blum continued.

Do You Need The Speed?

Tech reporters love to hype the increased speeds that the various ISPs are now providing but for most Americans it could be described as overkill.

“Most customers can’t effectively use let alone need gigabit speed service” said Blum. “But it’s cool to have like a professional grade impact driver or a $2000 espresso machine. Some customers with very particular circumstances can use 2 Gbps service but even then it would almost always be on the download side.”

Then there is the fact that some consumers could be misled regarding what they are actually paying for.

“With symmetrical service you would get 2 Gbps of bandwidth which is split between upload and download. You’re not getting 4 Gbps of bandwidth i.e. 2 Gbps up and 2 Gbps down” warned Blum. “A large household of power users or a teleworker with unusually demanding bandwidth needs and the same level of service and equipment on the employer’s side might make use of it. To achieve gigabit speeds you need gigabit capacity on both sides of the transmission.

“That said I think it’s great that Verizon and others are offering multi-gigabit service” he added. “It ever more dramatically highlights the gap between the digital haves and have-nots. There’s no injustice in offering gigabit-plus service to people. The injustice comes when incumbent telcos and cable companies cherry pick who they offer it to.”

According to reports by the City of Binghamton Fire Department posted on social media an explosion and fire Saturday afternoon August 13 at the Verizon Building on Henry Street can be traced to a possible transformer problem in the basement of the building.

Firefighters responded to the building at 64 Henry Street just yards from the Downtown Binghamton Post office at 2:23 p.m. and found heavy black smoke rising from the sidewalk grates.

According to the fire department's account on Facebook: ""These grates typically indicate to firefighters that there are underground utilities below the sidewalk.""

Authorities say firefighters conducted searches of the Verizon building and surrounding structures. The account relates crews were looking not only for possible victims but also for any fire extension indication of gas leaks or any build-up of carbon monoxide.

There were no reports of injury or any fire resulting from the blast that apparently happened in a utilities vault in the basement.

New York State Electric and Gas crews were called in and the street was closed off on the block in front of the building.

The account by the fire department indicates the incident had a potential for becoming much more serious.

The BFD Facebook post reports:

""Our members stood by with various extinguishing agents and used sensitive electronic meters to make sure the below ground area was safe for NYSEG to enter. Firefighters then stood by prepared to rescue the NYSEG crew from the confined space in case they encountered difficulty.""

Authorities say when NYSEG crews reached the utility vault they found a 12000 volt heavy amperage transformer had exploded.

Photos posted online show a half-inch thick cover plate on the transformer that had been secured with several heavy-duty bolts had been blown off and launched across to the opposite wall before apparently bouncing back to the other side of the vault.

Authorities say: ""it was very fortunate that there were no civilians in the area of the sidewalk at the time of the explosion.""

But you could say the same about the similarly priced iPhone 11 which offers advantages such as a bigger screen and dual cameras for $499 (£489 AU$849).

If you're trying to decide between the two consider which factors matter to you the most. The new iPhone SE supports 5G networks which may not be critical right now but could be in the years to come. It also runs on Apple's newest mobile processor. But the iPhone 11 has a significantly larger screen and a secondary ultrawide camera lens for taking broader photos.

Apple is also expected to release the iPhone 14 in September which means other current phones might get a price drop in the near future.

Our full review of the iPhone SE has more detail about its benefits and shortcomings but here's how it compares to the iPhone 11.

Carriers like Verizon are continuing to expand their 5G networks. Verizon

Do you really need 5G?

When the iPhone SE launched in March the iPhone 11 became the only phone Apple sells that doesn't support 5G. Is that a big deal? The answer is a bit complicated.

The short answer? No you don't need 5G today especially if you're satisfied with the speeds you're getting from your current 4G device. But you'll probably want 5G in the next two to three years.

Even then you probably don't need to worry about your 4G phone becoming obsolete anytime soon. Carriers are only just phasing out 3G networks in 2022 after the network launched 20 years ago in 2002. If 4G LTE networks follow the same trajectory carriers likely won't begin phasing them out until roughly 2030 since these networks only began rolling out around 2010.

Now the longer answer.

For the most part today's broadly available 5G networks are only slightly faster than 4G LTE and coverage can vary depending on your location and carrier. As such the shift to 5G probably hasn't been very noticeable for many people just yet and probably won't be in the short term.

Watch this: Review: The iPhone SE Is an Incredible Value 12:36

The fastest version of 5G known as millimeter wave isn't available on the iPhone SE. But even if it was you probably wouldn't end up using it very often if at all. This type of 5G only operates at short distances since it has trouble penetrating buildings and other structures. That means you can only find it in select areas like certain stadiums and intersections in specific cities.

Verizon has been the most aggressive carrier in deploying this 5G flavor but you're likely only going to encounter it on certain street corners in major cities or in parts of certain airports stadiums or arenas.

The more important version of 5G known as midband is present in the iPhone SE. This is the sweet spot among 5G flavors and offers the best mix of coverage and speed. Because nothing is ever simple there are also a few versions of this flavor of 5G. But the iPhone SE supports most of the versions deployed by carriers today.

It's not available everywhere yet and coverage varies by carrier. But network providers are making progress. Verizon and AT&T just turned on their C-band networks on Jan. 19 but are moving quickly. Verizon says it already covers over 100 million people with C-band 5G (what it calls ""Ultra Wideband"" or ""UW"") and is targeting 175 million people by the end of 2022.

T-Mobile has built out an early lead in 5G thanks to its Sprint purchase a couple of years ago. It already covers 210 million people with its midband 5G (what it calls ""Ultra Capacity"" or ""UC"") and is aiming to cover 260 million people by the end of this year and 300 million in 2023.

AT&T has backed off its targets for midband 5G coverage (what it calls ""5G Plus"") in 2022 but is aiming to cover 200 million people with its midband spectrum by the end of next year. The iPhone SE supports some flavors of AT&T's midband 5G (the version known as C-band) but does not work with all of it namely the 3.45GHz spectrum that the carrier will begin deploying later this year nationwide. To get the full AT&T 5G experience you may need to buy a 2022 flagship phone such as Samsung's Galaxy S22 or wait for other devices like the rumored iPhone 14 to appear.

The new iPhone SE Apple

The iPhone SE's pros and cons

The iPhone SE would be the right choice for those who want the least expensive iPhone and prefer smaller devices. Other than its low price the iPhone SE's biggest attributes are its support for 5G and the inclusion of Apple's A15 Bionic chip. That's the same chip found inside the iPhone 13 meaning the iPhone SE has some of Apple's more modern internal camera upgrades.

For example the iPhone SE has the latest version of Apple's high dynamic range processing for photos known as Smart HDR 4. The company says this technology applies different optimizations around noise color and contrast for the subject compared to the background of an image which should make the subject stand out.

The iPhone SE also has a feature called Photographic Styles that debuted on the iPhone 13. It lets users apply preset color and contrast profiles to the camera app that kicks in each time you take a photo and can be customized. Apple's pixel-by-pixel photo processing technology which should result in crisper detail and texture also works on the selfie camera in addition to the main camera. Apple calls this feature Deep Fusion.

These upgrades should certainly make the new iPhone SE better at taking photos than its predecessor. But whether it's better than the iPhone 11 is a tougher question. The iPhone 11's A13 Bionic chip doesn't support some of the newer software processing features seen in the new iPhone SE. These include Photographic Styles and the most recent version of Apple's high dynamic range capabilities.

But the iPhone 11 does have other extras that photographers might appreciate compared to the iPhone SE. The biggest of them is a dual-lens camera that includes a standard lens and an ultrawide lens meaning you can capture scenes with a much broader field of view than the iPhone SE.

Other than general performance and some additional camera improvements having the newest Apple processor also means the iPhone SE will support new iOS features for generations to come. To be clear Apple's iOS 16 operating system can run on iPhones as old as the iPhone 8 and iPhone X from 2017. So it doesn't look like the iPhone 11 from 2019 will lose software updates anytime soon.

But having the A15 Bionic inside of the iPhone SE instead of the iPhone 11's slightly older chip could enable more new features for years to come. Certain features in iOS like spatial audio in FaceTime and Siri's on-device processing only work on Apple's 2018 iPhones and later even though older phones can still run the software.

That said there are also some hardware-based restrictions that limit the iPhone SE's capabilities even with its newer chip. Unlike the iPhone 11 the iPhone SE lacks ultra wideband functionality which is the tech that makes it possible for your iPhone to provide turn-by-turn directions when locating lost AirTags. This isn't a deal breaker and likely won't impact daily use. But it's worth thinking about if you own or are thinking about purchasing AirTags.

The iPhone SE is also the only model Apple sells that still has a physical home button with Touch ID. That might be ideal if you're upgrading from an older phone like the iPhone 8 and don't want to learn Apple's swipe gestures. It's also good if you simply aren't into Face ID especially since you don't need to make any adjustments to Touch ID when you are wearing a face mask.

All told the iPhone SE is the right choice if you prefer smaller phones and want the cheapest iPhone possible. If you'd rather have a phone that will feel fast and support more general iOS features for years to come but don't care about having a bigger screen or more versatile camera it's the right phone for you.

The iPhone 11

The iPhone 11's pros and cons

Despite lacking 5G and Apple's newest processor the iPhone 11 feels more like a modern phone than the iPhone SE in several ways. It has a larger 6.1-inch screen which is the same size as the iPhone 13's display. It also supports Face ID like Apple's other flagship iPhones and has a dual-lens camera. The iPhone 11 also has Apple's newer design with a nearly borderless screen while the iPhone SE has bezels above and below the display.

The screen is one of the most important aspects of any phone since it's how we interact with our devices. As such display size should be a major factor when deciding between the iPhone SE and iPhone 11. Both phones have an LCD screen and the same number of pixels per inch so they should offer similar quality. But there's a drastic difference in size. If you do a lot of reading and TV watching on your phone the iPhone 11 might be the better choice.

The camera is another major consideration. While the iPhone SE gains some benefits from the A15 Bionic processor the iPhone 11's dual-lens camera has more flexibility when it comes to shooting modes.

If you take a lot of group shots with friends or family or love capturing broad scenic views during a hike you might want the iPhone 11's secondary lens with a wider field-of-view. The iPhone 11 has Night Mode too which greatly improves your phone's ability to take photos in dark scenarios. You won't get either of those features on the iPhone SE although Apple does say the new phone should capture better videos in low light.

The iPhone 11 should also provide longer two additional hours of battery life than the iPhone SE when playing back video based on Apple's estimates.

The bottom line

On paper the iPhone SE is better suited for long-term use thanks to its A15 Bionic processor and 5G support. But I'd say both phones are really meant to be upgraded after two to three years -- for different reasons.

The iPhone 11's processor is already two generations old and it doesn't support 5G so you might miss out on faster speeds and certain iOS features if you hold out for too long. But depending on your preferences you might also find the iPhone SE's tiny screen and single-lens camera to be limiting after a couple of years.

The iPhone 11 is a better all-around choice if you don't mind possibly upgrading in the next two to three years for 5G. But if you just want a basic iPhone that's more affordable and designed to last for a while the iPhone SE is the right pick. Just remember you'll have to be willing to sacrifice newer features like a dual-lens camera a larger screen and better low-light photography.

Either phone should offer a noticeable step up for anyone upgrading from an iPhone that's at least 3 to 4 years old. Before you decide it's also worth checking whether you're eligible for any trade-in discounts through your carrier or other retailers. You might be able to snag an iPhone 13 for hundreds of dollars less than its regular price if you meet the right conditions which could be a better option for some budget shoppers.

MICHIGAN — Public school systems in Michigan won’t require students heading back to school this fall to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Last year as the omicron variant surged following holiday travel and gatherings mandatory vaccinations were floated in several states and school districts to control the spread of the virus that nationwide has killed 1.03 million people since the pandemic began in 2020 including 37671 in Michigan.

The only place in the country where students will be required to get vaccinated against the coronavirus as a condition of enrollment this fall is the District of Columbia. The requirement applies to “all students who are of an age for which there is a COVID-19 vaccination fully approved by the FDA.”

California considered similar requirements but backed away from a COVID-19 vaccine mandate last spring. Legislatures in 20 states ban local school districts from requiring students to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

They are: Alabama Arizona Arkansas Florida Georgia Idaho Indiana Iowa Kansas Mississippi Montana New Hampshire Ohio Oklahoma South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah and West Virginia. As part of the deal to pass Michigan's $70 billion budget last fall the decision to require students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 will be left up to local school districts themselves. Moreover Michigan public agencies can't require employees or customers to get vaccinated. In other words local school district's cannot force school faculty to be vaccinated against the virus.

Only about 30 percent of U.S. children ages 5-11 are fully vaccinated according to the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. About 60 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds are fully vaccinated. Overall about 223 million people — or about 67 percent of the eligible U.S. population — have been fully vaccinated nationwide including 107.5 million people who have gotten their booster shots according to the CDC. In Michigan 61 percent of all eligible persons are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 according to data from the New York Times. Of that number 89 percent of 65 and older are fully vaccinated in addition to 65 percent of ages 18-64 48 percent for ages 12-17 and 27 percent for ages 5-11.

Will Students Mask? The CDC relaxed its mask guidance in February telling K-12 schools they could tie their local policies to the community rates of COVID-19 illnesses and hospital capacity rather than the total number of COVID-19 cases. Accordingly schools are easing protocols to slow COVID-19 transmission even as the BA.5 variant — the most contagious to date — quickly spreads across the country. For example only seven of the nation’s largest 500 school districts planned to require students and staff wear masks according to the tracking company Burbio. That compares with 369 large school districts requiring masks in October 2021. In Michigan local school districts will decide for themselves whether to enforce mask mandates in schools or not. In February state health officials dropped their recommendation for universal mask wearing in schools. In part the decline in mask requirements in big school districts is due to political pressure. In Georgia for example Clayton County Public Schools can’t require students to wear masks because of a state ban but it does require adults and visitors to wear face coverings.

“The goal is to be in person face-to-face as close to normal as possible” Morcease Beasley the district’s superintendent told EducationWeek an independent news organization that covers education and school issues. “Staff are being very supportive visitors are being very supportive and many students while it’s not required of them are wearing them as well.” Pre-COVID Anti-Vax Tide A tide of vaccine skepticism was sweeping the country before the COVID-19 pandemic hit threatening to wipe out progress to eliminate measles mumps and other childhood diseases decades after they were all but eradicated in the United States. The bitterly polarizing issue pits public health officials and others in the medical profession — and a growing number of state lawmakers — against so-called “anti-vaxxers” who often cite religious freedom personal objections and government overreach in their decisions to delay vaccinations or not immunize their children at all. Much of the current opposition to vaccines can be traced to a 1988 article published in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet in which former British doctor Andrew Wakefield falsely linked the MMR vaccine to autism. His co-authors and the journal all redacted it and Wakefield lost his medical license over his claims. Though the claim has been debunked over and over it still pops up on social media as fact worsening fears of vaccine safety.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia have laws on the books requiring that students be vaccinated against early childhood diseases but most of them — 44 as of May — allow religious exemptions as well. Additionally 15 allow for philosophical exemptions for children whose parents object to immunizations because of personal moral or other beliefs. Many states align their vaccine requirements with recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. State laws vary greatly in what they require. All states but Alabama require students to be vaccinated against hepatitis B. About a half dozen states or locations — Connecticut Massachusetts New Jersey New York City Ohio Pennsylvania and Rhode Island — require students to get an annual flu shot. In general kindergarteners ages 4-6 must be vaccinated against chickenpox; diphtheria tetanus and pertussis (DTaP vaccine); measles mumps and rubella (MMR vaccine); and polio. By middle and high school students should be vaccinated against meningococcal disease human papillomavirus (HPV vaccine) and Serogroup B meningococcal infection. Michigan requires vaccinations against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis polio Measles Mumps Rubella Hepatitis B and Varicella (Chickenpox) according to Britannica’s ProCon.org.

Exemptions are allowed in Michigan for religious and philosophical reasons according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYWhlYWx0aGllcm1pY2hpZ2FuLm9yZy9zdG9yaWVzL2NvbW11bml0eS93b29kd2FyZC1kcmVhbS1jcnVpc2Utc3Vydml2YWwtZ3VpZGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2023 Woodward Dream Cruise Preview & Survival Guide,"Nothing embodies the Motor City in the summertime like the Woodward Dream Cruise.

If you’re a Dream Cruise regular you probably know how to prepare for the day. But if it’s been a while since you’ve been – or you are brand new to it – this survival guide should prepare you to fully enjoy this iconic event. This year's Cruise falls on Saturday Aug. 19.

The 16-mile Woodward Dream Cruise begins in Pontiac and concludes in Ferndale. Between those two cities the route encompasses seven other municipalities in this order: Birmingham Royal Oak Berkley Huntington Woods and Pleasant Ridge. Check out the map at this link

Dress and pack accordingly

Packing for the Dream Cruise is a bit tricky because you want to pack lightly since you’ll likely bounce around a lot during the day. But at the same time you need to be fully prepared. Bring these essentials:

Drinking water and snacks

Portable camping chairs and/or a large blanket that you don’t mind dirtying up

Sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher)

Umbrellas and/or ponchos if rain is in the forecast

You’ll probably walk a lot so wearing comfortable shoes is a must. It might be tempting to whip out the cowboy boots for style points or flip flops for convenience but your feet will thank you later if you wear a reliable pair of sneakers.

Know the parking situation and parade route

A handful of participating cities offer municipal parking at these locations:

Birmingham : All activities are within walking distance of the city’s downtown parking decks.

Michigan law requires that drivers stop at least 20 feet from a school bus when it has it red lights flashing.

MICHIGAN — As kids head back to school motorists in Michigan may be a bit rusty about what to do when they encounter a stopped school bus.

Motorists in all 50 states are required to come to a complete stop when the bus stop arm is extended. Not quite half of them allow stop-arm cameras that can help investigators piece together what happened after accidents or prosecute motorists who violate school bus safety laws. There are other differences in state law. Michigan law requires that drivers stop at least 20 feet from a school bus when it has it red lights flashing. Drivers must remain stopped until the bus' red lights turn off or if the bus resumes driving. However drivers do not need to stop for the bus if it's on the other side of a divided road with a barrier such as a concrete or grass median an island or other structures that divide the two roads.

Those who vIolate the law are subject to anywhere between $100 and $500 fine and may also be required to perform up to 100 hours of community service at a school.

One thing is clear from federal data: Inattentive drivers put students at risk.

More than a third of the 301 children who died in school-transportation-related crashes from 2006-2015 were killed while approaching or leaving the bus when the stop arm was extended according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data. One Deadly Week In 2018 In a one-week period in 2018 five children were killed and six were injured in five separate incidents involving drivers who passed stopped school buses. Three Indiana siblings were killed — 6-year-old twins and their 9-year-old stepsister — and another student was hurt on Oct. 29 2018 while they were waiting for their school bus which authorities said had its stop arm extended and lights flashing.

A day later a 9-year-old boy in Mississippi was killed in the Tupelo Mississippi suburb of Pratts while crossing a highway to catch the school bus. The driver accused of striking the child was arrested and charged with one count of aggravated assault. On the same day a kindergarten student in Tallahassee Florida was injured when he was struck by a car while crossing the street to board his school bus. The bus had extended the crossing arm and the driver of the vehicle told police he realized too late that the bus had stopped.

On Nov. 1 five children were injured while waiting for the bus in Tampa Florida. Two adults were also hurt when a vehicle heading eastbound hit the group. Witnesses said the driver of the vehicle had been speeding before the crash. Also that day a second-grade student was killed at a bus stop in a hit-and-run accident Tyrone Pennsylvania. The boy was already dead when the bus driver pulled up to the stop and called 911 the Tyrone Area School District superintendent said in a statement of the hit-and-run accident. The potential for fatal and injury accidents exists every day according to the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services. States are taking various approaches to the problem. The Kansas Department of Education conducts a one-day count of school bus passing incidents every year. In its most recent count it estimated that as many as 15 million vehicles could be improperly passing school buses transporting students each school year gambling with children’s lives.

For example 22 states have now passed stop-arm camera laws to catch motorists who pass school buses when they’re stopped to pick up or let off children. They include Alabama Arkansas Connecticut Georgia Illinois Indiana Maine Maryland Mississippi New York North Carolina Oklahoma Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina Tennessee Utah Virginia Washington West Virginia and Wyoming. California doesn’t have a stop-arm camera law but takes a unique approach with a law that has been in place since 1932 that requires school bus drivers to walk with students in grades kindergarten through eight when they need to cross a roadway according to School Transportation News. The driver must verbally tell students when it’s safe to cross rather than use hand signals that could be mistaken for a motorist’s signal to proceed. The law also requires the driver to shut off the bus and remove the keys. “There are a multitude of options out there” National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services President Michael LaRocco told School Transportation News in 2018. “There’s not one silver bullet out there other than the simplest silver bullet — motorists need to pay attention to what’s going on around them.” If not operated properly vehicles are weapons that “will kill kids” LaRocco said. “We need to look at the idea of doing more instruction at a public level with the motorists. … We can do [driver and student] training forever and a day but we can’t stop a motorist that’s not paying attention.” Research shows that driver distraction especially with increased cellphone use creates hazards on the road. But students are distracted too and don’t always pay attention to traffic before they cross the road sometimes because they’re listening to music through earbuds or headphones.

The most dangerous part of the “danger zone” for students is the 10-foot area around the entire school bus when it stops according to the School Bus Safety Company. The trainers there advise that if there’s a crossing gate installed on the bus students should walk the length about 10 feet then check for traffic and wait for the driver’s signal to cross. Then or if no such equipment is installed students should walk to the edge of the bus bumper stop and check for traffic then cross the street. That’s particularly important for young students. The national school bus stop survey conducted annually by the Kansas Department of Education found that 73 percent of the students who were killed while getting on or off the bus over the past 48 years were 9 years old or younger. “Would you let your 5- or 6-year-old cross the street by themselves?” Dick Fischer a former school transportation director in California who now owns Transportation Consultant Group says in safety training courses. A proponent of laws like the one in California he asks: “Is it safer for you to cross the kids or is it safer for you to sit in your seat and wave the kid on?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vcmFyZS51cy9yYXJlLW1lZGlhL3RpZmZhbmktdGhpZXNzZW4taGFzLWV2ZXJ5b25lLWR1c3Rpbmctb2ZmLXNhdmVkLWJ5LXRoZS1iZWxsLXBvc3RlcnMtYWZ0ZXItYmF0aGluZy1zdWl0LXNuYXAv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXJlLnVzL3JhcmUtbWVkaWEvdGlmZmFuaS10aGllc3Nlbi1oYXMtZXZlcnlvbmUtZHVzdGluZy1vZmYtc2F2ZWQtYnktdGhlLWJlbGwtcG9zdGVycy1hZnRlci1iYXRoaW5nLXN1aXQtc25hcC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tiffani Thiessen Has Everyone Dusting Off ‘Saved By The Bell’ Posters After Bathing Suit Snap,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 410 Client Error: Gone for url: https://rare.us/rare-media/tiffani-thiessen-has-everyone-dusting-off-saved-by-the-bell-posters-after-bathing-suit-snap/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vcmFyZS51cy9yYXJlLW1lZGlhL3RpZmZhbmktdGhpZXNzZW4taGFzLWV2ZXJ5b25lLWR1c3Rpbmctb2ZmLXNhdmVkLWJ5LXRoZS1iZWxsLXBvc3RlcnMtYWZ0ZXItYmF0aGluZy1zdWl0LXNuYXAv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXJlLnVzL3JhcmUtbWVkaWEvdGlmZmFuaS10aGllc3Nlbi1oYXMtZXZlcnlvbmUtZHVzdGluZy1vZmYtc2F2ZWQtYnktdGhlLWJlbGwtcG9zdGVycy1hZnRlci1iYXRoaW5nLXN1aXQtc25hcC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

A woman is suing Walmart for a parking lot fire that killed one of her daughters in 2019.

Walmart has long welcomed people traveling overnight in RVs and vans into its lots.

But the suit shines a new light on the popular practice.

Walmart parking lots have long been a haven for recreational vehicles and other drivers looking to sleep in their cars. But a new lawsuit has invited scrutiny on that practice.

A woman named Essie McKenzie is suing Walmart after her 6-year-old daughter was killed and another daughter then 9 years old was left ""disfigured"" when their minivan became engulfed in flames. The incident took place during the early morning of August 6 2019 at a Walmart in Fridley Minnesota.

According to the lawsuit the fire began when a man and woman from California who had camped in the Walmart lot the evening before moved their 2005 Dodge Caravan to a spot next to McKenzie's vehicle a 2014 Caravan. McKenzie was out of the van at the time shopping in the store. Her daughters were asleep inside the vehicle.

According to the lawsuit the California man had used a camping stove to make breakfast on the pavement that morning and stored the stove in the back of his vehicle ""without waiting for it to cool and tossed some bedding on top of the cook stove."" He then moved the vehicle to a spot adjacent to McKenzie's and entered the store.

While he was in Walmart the van caught fire and the blaze spread to neighboring vehicles including McKenzie's. The man who lit up and stored the camping stove received a sentence of 120 days in jail in 2020 according to a report by The Miami Herald's Mitchell Willetts.

McKenzie's lawsuit filed last month in U.S District Court in Minnesota accuses Walmart of failing to monitor and protect ""overnight guests"" in the parking lot. The suit is asking for at least $75000.

""Our sympathies remain with the friends and family impacted by this tragic event three years ago"" a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement to Insider. ""We plan to defend the company and will respond in Court to the Complaint as appropriate.""

Walmart has traditionally welcomed RV-based customers as well as other drivers who opt to spend the night in its lots.

""While we do not offer electrical service or accommodations typically necessary for RV customers Walmart values RV travelers and considers them among our best customers"" the company said in a FAQ page on its website. ""Consequently we do permit RV parking on our store parking lots as we are able. Permission to park is extended by individual store managers based on availability of parking space and local laws.""

That has made the big-box giant a hit with many campers and individuals opting for an RV-based lifestyle. But those days may be ending. In 2020 CNN reported that the number of Walmart stores allowing overnight RV parking had dropped sharply from 78% to around 58%.

The country's largest private employer halted its stores' 24-hour operations because of the coronavirus outbreak in 2020 but some social media users are claiming that will soon change.

“Great news for late night shoplifters. 24 hour Walmart starts back August 142022” read an Aug. 9 Facebook post that was shared more than 3000 times in less than two days.

Other versions of the claim were shared tens of thousands of times across the social media platform.

But the retail giant told USA TODAY it has no plans to return to 24-hour operations.

USA TODAY reached out to social media users who shared the claim for comment. One of the Facebook pages said the post was meant to be interpreted as satire.

'No plans' to return to 24-hour Walmart stores

Walmart has not recently announced changes to its store hours

“There are no plans at this time to return our Walmart stores to 24-hour-a-day operations” Walmart spokesperson Charles Crowson told USA TODAY in an Aug. 11 email.

The retailer also said it would not be returning to a round-the-clock schedule in a July 29 tweet.

On March 14 2020 the company had announced its typically 24-hour stores would be open from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Fact check:Disney+ has gained subscribers not lost them

Hours were then adjusted several more times including opening an hour early for a time for older shoppers or those most vulnerable to the virus. The store then returned to a 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. schedule in June 2021 hours that are in place nationwide ""unless otherwise mandated by a government agency"" according to Walmart's COVID-19 information page.

Our rating: False

Based on our research we rate FALSE the claim that Walmart will be open 24 hours a day starting on Aug. 14. A spokesperson for the retailer told USA TODAY it has no plans to return to the 24-hour operations that were in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Grand Prairie police said a shooting at a Walmart Saturday night sent one person to a hospital.

The shooting happened at the Walmart in the 2000 block of W. I-20.

Officers were called after a fight between two men.

One of the men pulled out a gun and shot the other in the leg.

Both left the scene before police arrived on scene. No other injuries were reported.

Bassoul said heavy discounting turned the parks into ""a day care center for teenagers.""

Six Flags CEO Selim Bassoul is in hot water over what some are calling classist remarks.

In a call with investors this week Bassoul said the amusement park chain is seeking to transform its average guest from ""the Kmart Walmart to maybe the Target customers"" adding that heavy discounting in previous years had turned the parks into ""a day care center for teenagers.""

""The philosophy of filling our parks was not the right strategy .... we only got the discounter or we became a day care center for teenagers"" he said. ""It was a cheap day care center for teenagers during breaks and the summers.""

Bassoul's comments quickly drew scorn from several Twitter users who took to the platform to air their grievances the statements they described as ""classist"" and ""just idiotic.""

—kyle tear that highway down lucas (@itskylelucas) August 12 2022

—not the guy (@notnotnuanced) August 12 2022

Since taking over as top executive in November 2021 Bassoul has focused on ""premium-ization strategy"" dedicated to creating a more upscale experience at parks and hiking prices. In a previous earnings call he referred to ""restroom and restaurant upgrade and food upgrade in all our parks.""

But the move ultimately has come at a cost to consumers with higher admission prices and cuts to discounts and coupons and it appears the strategy may not be working as well as intended: Guest attendance dropped by 22% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year the company reported.

""Our attendance decrease was related to the elimination of free tickets and low-margin product offerings coupled with increased pricing into a market that had become accustomed to discounts"" Six Flags CFO Gary Mick said on the call.

But Bassoul doubled down on Six Flags' pricing strategy stating that while the company's aim ""has always been to be a park for the middle-class and even lower middle-class"" there was ""no point"" in trying to recapture lost customers struggling with record-high inflation.

""They suffered with their utilities at home. They suffered with their pricing at the supermarket. Those people were not able to come"" he said. ""And hopefully if the inflation comes back to normal I'm hoping that some of those people come back to our parks and enjoy the new premium-ization and beautification."""

While Dusty Sage was able to experiment with it earlier this summer my son Johnny and I were able to see how it works around the parks. Join us on our journey as we explore the games interactivity lights and taps that MagicBand+offers.

Purchasing and Setting up MagicBand+

MagicBand+ is found at a few locations throughout Walt Disney World and there is quite a variety of both solid-colored and themed bands. The prices start at $34.99 for the solid and $44.99 for the themed bands; both versions include the charging cable. And if you lose your charging cable replacements can be purchased.

We bought our MagicBand+ the day before we intended to use it in the parks. This ended up being a smart move as they were not fully charged and needed an update. Luckily if you buy and use it on the same day the bands charge very quickly. The update only took a few minutes. What took the most time was linking the bands to the My Disney Experience account. With only a QR code to get instructions it was difficult to navigate on my phone between the directions and linking the MagicBand+ on the same device. Some paper instructions would have been helpful. And it took multiple attempts to link both MagicBand+ devices.

Johnny and I headed to Magic Kingdom with my oldest son who bought his MagicBand+ while at Magic Kingdom. He was having problems linking his band and went for help. The Guest Experience team told us they were having more problems linking bands to Android vs. iPhone. He continued to attempt to link the MagicBand+ to his Android throughout the day and was eventually successful.

You will need to be prepared to charge your MagicBand+ prior to each day of use as the charge does not last long.

Fab 50 Character Statue Encounters with MagicBand+

One of the heavily promoted interactions with the new bands is the Fab 50 statues which now interact with a wave of the MagicBand+. Johnny excitedly approached our first statue to see what the character would say to him. As you get in the vicinity of a statue your MagicBand+ vibrates to let you know a MagicBand+ interaction is near. A simple wave and the Fab 50 statues speak or play music. With multiple interactions you can try a second or third time for a different response.

Alas the MagicBand+ interaction is not always as easy as a simple wave. First try a soft wave. Then a little bigger. Maybe a little faster? Closer? Further away? A quick double tap on the band? It is indeed comical to watch children and adults frantically waving looking for a response from a statue. Although Johnny’s method is to run up to the statue and wave vigorously we have found that the best method is to wave and then double-tap your band. If neither of those work it’s best to walk away come back and try again.

You know when your band is successful because it lights up and vibrates. But with multiple people waving your band doesn’t always interact. As we continued to move through the statues it became a challenge for us to get our MagicBand+ to work.

The Disney Play app has a Fab 50 Quest so you can follow along and collect all 35 statues and 50 characters in all 4 theme parks. You even collect avatars of select characters although where that leads to has yet to be seen. If you are playing the game you want to make sure you get the character interaction by having your MagicBand+ vibrate and light up.

Bounty Hunting with MagicBand+

Star Wars fans have been waiting on the release of the MagicBand+ since the tease of the Bounty Hunter Quest in Galaxy’s Edge a few months back. My little Jedi was ready to become a Bounty Hunter in Batuu. Once Johnny’s Disney Play account was set up we were on our way (more on that later).

It wasn’t too difficult to find the bounty board to accept a job near Black Spire Station. Johnny scanned his MagicBand+ went through the instructions and accepted his first bounty. Note the instructions will display on the screen but only the first time after that you will only receive the information on your target and bounty information.

This is where the Disney Play App becomes important. The Disney Play app allows you to see your target their name crime and the bounty credits the catch is worth.

Now that Johnny has his target we are ready to search Batuu. The MagicBand+ lights up green and circles slowly so you know you are on the hunt. We headed towards the Marketplace. Johnny’s MagicBand+ continued to light green and began to circle faster. A sure sign we were headed in the right direction.

Suddenly the MagicBand+ lit up red we went too far. Time to backtrack until the band turns green again. As we walked into Marketplace and the band lights started circling very quickly green with a fast vibration. We are back on track and getting closer.

Johnny approaches a door and scans the entry point. The MagicBand+ flashes. Wrong door. Johnny heads to the next door success the band lights up purple. He’s located our target!

We open the Disney Play app and the scanner indicates the target has been located.

We point the device at the location of the target and the thermal scanner confirms the identity of his target.

Johnny and I head back to the Guildmaster’s Hideout to collect his credits (bounty). There was quite the line at times so pack your patience.

Johnny really enjoyed Bounty Hunting. I can see this being a regular occurrence with our park visits at least until he collects all the targets. There are only 20 targets currently he’s already collected 7. Once Johnny has them all will it still be worth hunting? I”m not so sure but only time will tell.

On a side note the MagicBand+ will direct you to go up and down stairs to get into the Marketplace to locate your target. Walking past the stairs to go around to street-level access will cause your band to light red and you would need to pick up the trail again once inside the Marketplace.

MagicBand+ Nighttime Show Interactions

Unfortunately our evening at Magic Kingdom got rained out and we were not able to experience Enchantment with the MagicBand+.

Over at EPCOT the MagicBand+ interacts with Harmonious and with Beacons of Light on Spaceship Earth. We were only able to catch one show so we chose Harmonious. The MagicBand+ did not light up the entire show only in portions of each segment. When the MagicBand+ did light up it did coordinate well with the show and music overall with different light patterns and color combinations. The band even occasionally vibrated.

I will say I found myself forgetting to look at my MagicBand+ throughout the show even though I was really trying to pay more specific attention to it. I noticed the same was true with Johnny he noticed me raising my MagicBand+ to look at it and then looked at his.

MagicBand+ and Disney Play

MagicBand+ works with Disney Play to complete quests. That said it is not necessary to experience any of the current interactions. Johnny enjoys using the Disney Play app be it the trivia or games only available while waiting in line. It’s a must-do for him while we wait in line for Rise of the Resistance.

However Disney Play is associated with the My Disney Experience account holder. Therefore Johnny has always played in my Disney Play. But with the MagicBand+ interacting with Disney Play it would make sense for Johnny to have his own. There is a workaround where parents can authorize a child to have access to Disney Play. This took me about 20 minutes with a Guest Experience Cast Member to figure out how to get Johnny set up and signed into his own account with the proper permissions.

The problem is that each family member would need to have a device with the app to be able to play and interact with MagicBand+. Johnny doesn’t have his own device which left me changing my Disney Play to his account. That means I cannot complete quests within Disney Play and if Johnny wants to continue his quest in the Resistance Encampment he either needs to start over or continue on my account.

I can live without my Disney Play and let Johnny use my device. Unfortunately the Disney Play switch was not easy and I am unsure how to change the app back from Johnny to me as it uses the same account information. That’s a Guest Experience visit for another day in the distant future.

MagicBand+ Hit or Miss?

Johnny and I have slightly different opinions when it comes to MagicBand+. I think that it is an expense that isn’t really necessary for an entire family. If one person has a MagicBand+ everyone can experience and see the band interact with the exception of the vibration. I see my band quickly becoming a dust catcher with my numerous previous version of MagicBands.

Contrary to my experience Johnny loves the MagicBand+. Even though he got a little frustrated when the Fab 50 statues didn’t immediately react he would just move on to the next one. For him Bounty Hunting was a big hit and probably the highlight of wearing the MagicBand+. At the moment he is committed to wearing the band where previously he wasn’t.

Overall the MagicBand+ is a nice gimmick but I would like to see what else they can do with it to make it a more attractive buy. After all its bells and whistles are pretty but currently limited. More activities in more parks are needed. And maybe (we’re hoping) the MagicBand+ will allow some of the promises of Galaxy’s Edge to come to fruition.

Allison Perry is a highly touted and widely recognized art director. She has one of the best repertoires of art directors worldwide. Allison has relished experiences working for some of the world’s foremost conglomerates. Some of the mega companies she has had the distinguished privilege of working for include Netflix Walt Disney Dreamworks Paramount Pictures Cartoon Network Nickelodeon Gameloft Riot Games and many more. Her career feats are indicative of her truly profound gifts. The Hype Magazine’s Life & Style correspondent Charles Myambo (CM) had an interview with Allison Perry (AP). Below are some excerpts from the interview.

Art Director @ Netflix – “Allison Perry

CM: Just looking at your resumé is enough to make anyone’s head spin a little. What has been your experience while working for/with Walt Disney Cartoon Network DreamWorks Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures?

AP: I think something a lot of people don’t realize about animation is just how much our work is short-term/freelance. Compared to other fields where an employee may work 5-10 years full-time at one company it’s not uncommon for animation workers to have lots of short contracts at many studios – even full-time work can last as short as 3 months! Much of the experience you listed was freelance and lasted less than a month. Due to tighter and tighter schedules/budgets teams frequently get crunched and have to bring on freelancers to meet deadlines. For that reason freelance work tends to be much more Silo’d than full-time work – you’re usually sent a handful of assignments that you don’t always know the context of don’t interface with (or sometimes even really know) anyone outside the few people coordinating your work and don’t really go into the office to work with the team. It’s not necessarily a bad thing – there’s a lot of flexibility in it and most of the experiences you listed were perfectly pleasant (albeit short) but it’s not what people usually think of when you say a “job.” While it may look very impressive on a resume it’s also quite stressful and exhausting because there’s not a lot of stability/consistency and you’re almost always looking for that next gig.

CM: Your pedigree in art design and animation is unprecedented! How does someone accomplish as much as you have over the past decade?

AP: lol thank you! Like I said a lot of it has just been trial-and-error – if anything I’d say adaptability persistence and fostering the ability to learn things by the seat of my pants have been just as important as drawing well… if not more so! I’m regularly faced with new and intimidating situations but I approach them with the trust that I can figure them out because I know one of my strengths is the ability to learn and adapt. I ask for help/advice a lot make my goals known to my community believe there’s nothing to lose in taking my shot for something I want try not to take rejection/failure personally and just generally strive to be my own best advocate. Learning to draw is time-consuming but ultimately pretty straight-forward – you can find plenty of cheap (or even free) curriculums online detailing how but I think a lot of people focus too much on the craft and while that’s important not developing adaptability and learning skills can make you rigid and difficult to place on a team.

CM: At present you have quite a pivotal role for streaming giant Netflix. Walk me through what comprises the work life of an art director @ Netflix.

AP: I actually started on my project as a background paint lead which reports to the art director then later stepped into the art director role a little over halfway through production after the previous one moved on. During pre-production most of our time was spent ramping up for production – ideating on and pitching important designs to the showrunner/execs fleshing out the style drafting documentation to help our artists during production putting together reference/inspiration to use as a springboard for design and creating key art that would go directly into the show. At the time I was the background paint lead so my attention was focused on the light/color/etc. of the background line art (which is created by the background designers and led by the background design lead) but the art director at the time was responsible for similar pre-vis tasks (as well as other things) albeit with a larger scope (backgrounds characters props and more). Both as a background paint lead as well as an art director once we moved into production my role became more managerial and the actual design work moved to the artists we hired. From the storyboards I identified what assets needed to be created assigned them to our designers put together reference/color keys/sketches to help them get started reviewed their work and sometimes did or completed work myself.

As an art director post-production is more about working with the partner studio (who actually does the animation and sometimes finalizes some design work as well) – you become the general point-person for design as everyone else on the in-house design team (including the leads) has moved on. This can include anything from help with post-production work like compositing/color correction/etc. giving feedback to the partner studio and last-minute design changes/additions. It’s the most jack-of-all-trades phase of art direction because you can be called upon to do just about anything that’s design-related and given the unpredictability of what may be needed in any one week the workload can vary wildly between light and heavy. All that being said I really want to highlight the fact that I don’t believe my role as a lead or art director is any more pivotal than that of the artists themselves. If anything I think their work is more important since they’re usually the ones actually creating the work – a cartoon can be made with a team of just artists but not with a team of just managers. In other words I’m largely there to make their job easier to do well. I think a lot of people want to lead because it feels prestigious and important but I think that’s the worst reason to want to do so. My philosophy is that my role is to be of service to my reports by advocating for and empowering them – not the other way around.

CM: How and when exactly did you realize that your artistic prowess was way above average?

AP: lol while there was definitely a point when I aspired to be “above average” I don’t know if that’s how I think about it now (or really even want to). Not only is comparison the thief of joy but also I think there’s more nuance to art than just “good” or “bad” – it’s not linear/hierarchical like that and I think understanding it in those terms can be really limiting and negative. Instead I try to understand work in terms of “fits” when it comes to professional work – an artist isn’t “good” or “bad” but rather they may be a “strong fit” or “poor fit” for the specific needs of a project in terms of style pace level-of-detail etc. Understanding this helps rejection not feel so personal – it’s not that you’re a “bad artist” you may just not be the “right fit” for that project. And when it comes to personal work I just try to follow my joy. If I want to draw I draw; if I don’t I don’t – I’m not doing it for anyone else but myself. I’ve made a very conscious effort over the years to decouple my personal work from any notion of what I “should be” doing or that I “need to” constantly improve – thinking about it in those terms is a quick way to make your free-time feel like a job and burn out which ironically isn’t even a very good or sustainable way to improve.

CM: What have been some of your favorite projects over the period of your illustrious career?

AP: Unfortunately I can’t say much about it specifically at the moment but I really like the project I’m on now – there’s a healthy work-life balance the people are patient and compassionate I feel valued and advocated for leadership has extended a lot of trust to me and I think it’s a genuinely beautiful show both visually and narratively. Before that I really enjoyed helping out on “City of Ghosts” – again: healthy work-life balance good people I felt valued and it was a really cool show both stylistically and narratively. It’s a hidden gem if you haven’t seen it yet – I highly recommend it!

CM: Accomplishments aside what has your life presented to you in terms of adversity and how have you managed to retain your drive amid trials?

AP: I didn’t start taking art seriously as a career until I was about 20 so I spent a lot of my early 20s feeling “behind” even though I know now that it’s not race and there’s no “too old” to start doing art (or anything else). It didn’t help that I think everyone is really confused and insecure in their early 20s and they tend to circulate and amplify that anxiety amongst themselves. It’s a tough age – I don’t miss it. I also struggled a lot with the disconnect between academic and career success – I got good grades but they never seemed to translate to job offers or even call-backs. It was really frustrating and demoralizing especially as my peers were getting internships/jobs and I wasn’t (even though I know now that others’ achievements have no bearing on my own). Eventually my impending student loan payments forced me to break out of the “just keep your head down and draw well/get good grades” mindset and come to terms with the fact that employment (especially in this economy) is about more than just skill. It’s highly dependent on network as well and I was neglecting that thinking if I just got “good enough” at art it’d “make up” for my lack of networking.

There’s a great book called “Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials” by Malcom Harris – I highly recommend it especially to anyone feeling a similar disconnect between “school” and “career.” Lastly I really hoped “success” in my career would resolve my low-self-esteem which over the years had resulted in very poor boundaries constant people-pleasing unhealthy relationships workaholism body image issues etc. I think a lot of people struggle with this because just like when you have a hammer every problem looks like a nail – when so much of your life is centered around work and career achievement it’s easy to assume more of it is the solution to everything. Low self-esteem isn’t about achievement though – it’s about how you value and feel about yourself and you heal that through therapy introspection a supportive community etc. not working harder.

CM: Lastly what would your message be to creatives around the world that would love to emulate your level of success?

AP: Haha my message would be “don’t.” “Success” is deeply subjective and nebulous. Everyone has different values goals needs etc. and my idea of “success” may look completely different from someone else’s. For example I value having my basic needs met and time to do what I love with the people I love – that has very little to do with my career outside of the salary and work-life balance I need to maintain it. “Success” measures achievement not joy love fulfillment community etc. which I would encourage not just creatives but everyone to reflect on because I think they make far better compasses than the vague idea of “success.” Also careers are rarely linear and no two are ever the same. There’s so much you have no control over and just as much that’s completely serendipitous and irreplicable. Instead I’d suggest focusing more on getting in touch with what joy fulfillment etc. look like to you identifying the actionable goalposts on the way to that breaking those goalposts into smaller more manageable steps and executing them.

By all means you can ask people for help and guidance on those steps but remember specific questions get specific answers. A broad question like “how can I emulate your success?” is too massive to meaningfully answer and if someone says they can I’d regard them with suspicion – especially if that answer comes with a hefty price-tag like a class mentorship college etc. I’m not saying these services aren’t worth compensation or that they can’t imbue you with skills/networking opportunities that may lead to positive outcomes but no one class mentorship college etc. is a one-stop shop for “success.” If anything I’d just reiterate the earlier point be persistent adaptable and self-advocating. Don’t be afraid to shoot your shot try not to take rejection too personally and learn how to learn quickly – those skills go a long way."
WBD,Warner Bros Discovery,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMTMvMjMzMDAyMzcvZGNldS1lenJhLW1pbGxlci10aGUtZmxhc2hiYXRnaXJsLWJsYWNrLWFkYW0tZGF2aWQtemFzbGF20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The DCEU has become a crisis of Warner Bros.' own making,"One of the most curious details to come out of recent reports focused on the corporate fracas happening over at HBO Max and the rest of Warner Bros. Discovery was CEO David Zaslav’s announcement of an explicitly Marvel-esque decade-long plan for the studio’s films based on DC’s comic books. To listen to Zaslav’s assertion that this move’s meant to “grow” and “protect the DC brand” one might’ve gotten the impression that Warner Bros. wasn’t already in the midst of a years-long effort to build out a cinematic universe of superhero movies. To get that impression though one would somehow have to have forgotten or blocked out the DCEU Warner Bros.’ most-recent constellation of loosely-connected live-action comic book adaptations that began with Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel in 2013.

Looking at what happened to Batgirl it’s fairly obvious that post-merger the new guard at Warner Bros. Discovery wants to jettison or at the very least put some distance between itself and the DCEU’s current iteration (along with all the baggage associated with the endeavor.) But doing so is going to be an unenviable and almost impossible task for a multitude of reasons ranging from Black Adam’s impending release this fall to the fact that the studio still seems very bullish about its upcoming Flash feature starring actor Ezra Miller.

The DCEU often felt like it was racing towards a crisis event that would either make or break the franchise. While there was the possibility of that crisis being fictional and an adaptation of one of DC’s capital-C Crises storylines what’s become far more clear over the past few weeks is just how fraught the DCEU’s future is and how the studio might not be working with a solid gameplan.

Ezra Miller as Barry Allen in Justice League. Warner Bros.

The DCEU was plagued by a number of issues long before Warner Bros. took Discovery’s name like a general lack of cohesion subpar storytelling and an association with a toxic fandom whose obsession eventually devolved into harassment campaigns against studio executives. Looking back Justice League as it was released in 2017 was a haphazard attempt to catch up to the MCU that put far too much faith in the power of people’s general familiarity with characters like Wonder Woman Cyborg and Aquaman who didn’t really have presences in the DCEU at the time.

Though Justice League made quite a bit of money it was a far cry from the financial success that Warner Bros. wanted and needed it to be. In the wake of the movie’s box office underperformance one could plainly see Warner Bros. recalculating how it wanted to craft the DCEU and opening itself up to the idea that the traditional DC Trinity — that is Superman Batman and Wonder Woman — might not need to be the pillars of the brand.

The DCEU was plagued by a number of issues long before Warner Bros. took Discovery’s name

That idea and the unexpected success of projects like James Wan’s Aquaman and David F. Sandberg’s first Shazam! has a lot to do with why Black Adam a magically muscular throwback to the Bronze Age of DC’s comics will headline his own film before so many other much more well-known characters. It’s strange sometimes to think about Black Adam: a.) existing and b.) finally escaping development hell. But after director Todd Phillips’ first Joker and Matt Reeves’ The Batman two Elseworlds-style stories purposefully set outside the DCEU’s continuity it seemed as if Warner Bros. might have settled on making big bold standalone movies meant to win viewers over with their distinct voices.

From a financial perspective it’s not surprising that both Joker and The Batman are slated to get sequels but rather than leaning into those objective wins Warner Bros. Discovery’s apparently planning to keep chasing after an MCU-shaped white whale. It has been rather interesting to learn that Warner Bros. Discovery recently tacked on a completely new post-credits scene to Black Adam ahead of its October release meant to establish its titular antihero as a more significant power player in the DCEU.

Connecting Black Adam to the DCEU (presumably to fight his gang of child nemeses) would make much more sense if it were a thriving vibrant place where massive crossovers were portents of epic and awe-inspiring narratives to come.

But just as Hollywood’s settled into its current addiction to multiverses the DCEU’s fate has become potentially imperiled by its reliance on Ezra Miller in The Flash a universe-hopping epic that’s looking more and more like DC’s answer to Spider-Man: No Way Home. Despite how it’s frequently felt like Warner Bros. might just straight up not like making comic book movies the possibility of director Andy Muschietti’s Flash feature using the multiverse to link Warner Bros’ multitude of disparate comics adaptations together is a tantalizing one. In addition to echoing the beats of DC’s Flashpoint comics event using The Flash that way could one imagines lay the groundwork for a completely new direction for Warner Bros.’ superhero movies.

What Warner Bros. Discovery needs isn’t necessarily to make movies the way Marvel does

Along with all that possibility though The Flash has also become associated with the allegations of assault and grooming of children being leveled against Miller who reportedly showed up for the movie’s additional photography earlier this summer before being arrested in August. Warner Bros.’ reasons for not immediately wanting to hit the brakes on a tentpole movie years in the making — and just months before its intended release — are easy enough to understand up to a certain point. But with each different incident involving Miller since footage of them choking someone in an Icelandic bar surfaced in 2020 it’s increasingly appeared as if Warner Bros. might be willing to completely disregard the actor’s behavior in favor of putting The Flash first.

Between Warner Bros. shelving Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah’s nearly-completed $90 million Batgirl movie and Zaslav enthusiastically name-checking The Flash on investor calls it’s clear that studio leadership thinks there’s too much riding on the film to can it despite the damage Miller might do to the brand. Ultimately that may be the case but that sort of strategy-first substance-second approach to franchise building is precisely what brought Warner Bros. to this juncture in the first place and it could easily end up poisoning whatever future Warner Bros. Discovery has planned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC93YXJuZXItYnJvcy1kaXNjb3ZlcnktY29uZGVtbnMtamstcm93bGluZy10aHJlYXRzLTEyMzQ3NTE3MzIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros. Discovery Condemns J.K. Rowling Threats,"When Salman Rushdie was attacked on stage in Chautauqua New York on Friday it sent waves of shock through the entire creative community. The novelist who famously had a fatwa placed on him in 1989 by Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini because of his controversial novel “The Satanic Verses” was stabbed repeatedly and immediately rushed into surgery and placed on a ventilator. Though the author has now been taken off the ventilator and is expected to survive many are still on edge about the idea of physical violence being used against artists.

Many authors took to social media to support Rushdie including “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling. She called the attack “horrifying” and wrote that she was “sick” with worry about Rushdie. Soon after she shared threats made in her replies telling the author that she is “next.” She asked for support from Twitter then later revealed that she had involved the police.

While it is unclear if the Twitter threats had any connection to the attack on Rushdie Warner Bros. Discovery made a public statement on Sunday condemning both the violence against Rushdie and the threats made to Rowling .

The full statement from the company reads: “Warner Bros. Discovery strongly condemns the threats made against J.K. Rowling. We stand with her and all the authors storytellers and creators who bravely express their creativity and opinions. WBD believes in freedom of expression peaceful discourse and supporting those who offer their views in the public arena. Our thoughts are with Sir Salman Rushdie and his family following the senseless act of violence in New York. The company strongly condemns any form of threat violence or intimidation when opinions beliefs and thoughts might differ.”

Rowling has recently been a lightning rod for controversy due to the author’s tendency to pick online fights with the trans community about issues relating to sex and gender. But this is not the first time that the studio behind the “Harry Potter” films has stood by her. In June the company issued a statement saying that “Warner Bros. has enjoyed a creative productive and fulfilling partnership with J.K. Rowling for the past 20 years. She is one of the world’s most accomplished storytellers and we are proud to be the studio to bring her vision characters and stories to life now – and for decades to come.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy93YXJuZXItYnJvcy1tZ20taW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1wYXJ0bmVycy1ib25kLTEyMzUxOTg3NDgv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL3dhcm5lci1icm9zLW1nbS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXBhcnRuZXJzLWJvbmQtMTIzNTE5ODc0OC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros. to Release MGM Movies Overseas Excluding Next Bond Pic,"MGM has tapped Warner Bros. to be its new international partner giving Warners a shot at having a piece of the James Bond franchise. One caveat the arrangement doesn’t include the next James Bond film.

The two companies announced the arrangement Sunday.

MGM’s previous partner was Universal which released the 2022 James Bond installment No Time to Die internationally as well as such high-profile MGM titles as House of Gucci and Licorice Pizza.

Under the pact Warner Bros. International’s distribution division will handle all Warners movies beginning with the release of Bones and All in November of 2022 and Creed III which is set for 2023.

Universal Pictures International will still distribute MGM and Orion Pictures’ Till in October of this year and Women Talking in the first quarter of 2023. Bond 26 the next chapter in the James Bond series of films will also be distributed by Universal Pictures International as part of the studio’s original agreement (details of the movie have not yet been released).

The new partnership was unveiled by Warner Bros. co-chairs and CEOs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy — who recently arrived from MGM — and MGM COO Christopher Brearton.

The new multiyear deal encompasses the theatrical distribution of MGM films in territories outside of the U.S. including China. The new agreement also includes worldwide physical home entertainment distribution on all newly released MGM titles.

Under the terms of this arrangement MGM and Warners will collaborate on marketing/advertising publicity film distribution and exhibitor relations on behalf of MGM’s future slate of theatrical releases outside the North American theatrical market with Warners responsible for execution.

From filmmaker Luca Guadagnino Bones and All stars Taylor Russell Timothée Chalamet Michael Stuhlbarg André Holland Chloë Sevigny David Gordon-Green Jessica Harper Jake Horowitz and Mark Rylance.

Creed III is directed by Michael Jordan who also stars in the movie alongside Creed III stars Michael B. Jordan Tessa Thompson Jonathan Majors Wood Harris Phylicia Rashad Mila Kent Jose Benavidez Selenis Leyva Florian Munteanu Tony Bellew Jacob Duran Patrice Harris Ann Najjar Thadeus J. Mixson and Spencer Moore II.

The Bond series is considered the prize of MGM’s extensive library and Warners may be able to release James Bond 27 should that film come out within the time period of the partnership (it’s understood the deal can be extended beyond three years).

The Bond films are controlled by the London-based Eon which is run by half-siblings Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson. So far they haven’t revealed any specifics about where the series will go from here now that Daniel Craig is done playing the iconic spy.

Both MGM and Warner Bros. are under new leadership.

Discovery Condemns Threats Against J.K. Rowling Over Her Salman Rushdie Comments,"Warner Bros. Discovery today issued a statement supporting Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling who was threatened by a Twitter user for her anguish at last week’s attack on fellow author Salman Rushdie.

“Warner Bros. Discovery strongly condemns the threats made against J.K. Rowling” the company said today. “We stand with her and all the authors storytellers and creators who bravely express their creativity and opinions. WBD believes in freedom of expression peaceful discourse and supporting those who offer their views in the public arena. Our thoughts are with Sir Salman Rushdie and his family following the senseless act of violence in New York. The company strongly condemns any form of threat violence or intimidation when opinions beliefs and thoughts might differ.”

On Friday Rowling tweeted out a message on Rushdie who was attacked on stage at a speaking event. “Feeling very sick right now. Let him be ok” Rowling wrote.

A Twitter user responded with a threat. “Don’t worry you are next.”

Rowling tweeted Twitter directly with the message: “Any chance of some support?”

Twitter refused to take action and Rowling posted the company’s reply. “After reviewing the available information we determined that there were no violations of the Twitter rules in the content you reported. We appreciate your help and encourage you to reach out again in the future if you see any potential violations.”

Rowling later thanked her supporters and said that the “Police are involved” as she claimed they had been on prior threats to her.

Rushdie has been removed from a ventilator and is talking according to reports. The man who attacked him is being held without bail in New York and faces attempted murder charges.

Rushdie the author of the novel The Satanic Verses has been under a death threat issued in 1989 by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Rushdie was accused of “insulting Islam” in his novel. The death threat had a bounty of $3 million and Rushdie subsequently went into hiding when it was first issued. He has more recently eased up on his security which may have led to the attack last week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2h5LWJhdGdpcmxzLWNhbmNlbGxhdGlvbi1tYWtlcy16ZXJvLWNlbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Batgirl's Cancellation Makes Zero Cent$,"To be perfectly clear Batgirl being canceled by Warner Bros. Discovery is a bad thing. It doesn’t bode well for anybody who enjoys movies streaming or otherwise and it’s a major blow to the talented artists that worked hard on every phase of the film’s production and to the diversity this particular character represents.

As far as we’re concerned Kevin Smith put his finger on it by highlighting the fact that “it’s an incredibly bad look to cancel the Latina Batgirl movie” even “if the movie was absolute fucking dogshit” which he doubts was the case anyway.

Since its cancellation there have been a handful of reasons offered and excuses made for what is creatively speaking a very disappointing move by the newly merged Warner Bros. Discovery . Get ready for some accounting because we’re going to take a look at the financial implications of dropping Batgirl and how they stack up to a hypothetical release of the film.

Every DC Movie and Series Affected by the Warner Bros. Discovery Merger 20 Images

Batgirl and the ‘Tax Stuff’

One reason that’s been thrown out as a footnote in all the reporting around Batgirl’s cancellation is the tax incentive of reporting a loss. We’ve done our own taxes before so if the IRS asks we have a basic working knowledge of how this works. But just in case we talked to a handful of entertainment industry folks to help out with our napkin math from senior-level executives down to production accountants from different studios. There’s been a fair bit of reporting on this and we should say that estimates for what Warner Bros. Discovery is actually saving have kinda been all over the place. It’s hard to say for sure but here’s what we came up with.

In simple-ish terms a loss can be deducted from a company’s taxable income so by claiming the money they’ve already spent on Batgirl as a loss some $90 million by most reporting  Warner Bros. Discovery’s income on the year is reduced by that same amount. That’s 90 million bucks they won’t get taxed on.

Now that doesn’t mean $90 million shows back up in WBD’s pocket. The federal corporate tax rate is 21% so that means their tax bill will be reduced by 18.9 million bucks. On top of that New York State where Warner Bros. Discovery keeps their corporate headquarters also gets a cut of a company’s profits and its corporate tax rate is 7.25% or another $6.5 million. Basically that means Warner Bros. Discovery will pay Uncle Sam $25 million less just by pulling the plug on Batgirl.

Essentially this means that WBD is losing $65 million instead of the whole 90 million production budget. But throwing away a nearly finished movie so you can lose 65 million bucks begs a further question… how else could WBD get the same $90 million loss on their taxes from Batgirl had they instead decided to finish and release the film?

How to Find a $90 Million ‘L’

Well he says pushing his glasses up his nose let’s talk about what might’ve happened if they released the film in theaters instead of just on HBO Max.

First thing is they’d have to finish it. There are multiple reports that test screenings did not go well and VFX weren’t complete. This could mean reshoots more editing more effects work and more delivery costs for getting the movie in theaters. So after speaking to the same studio sources we feel safe in assuming it might cost another $10 million to complete the film.

But once you have a finished movie you gotta tell people about it; slapping Batgirl on buses billboards TV ads and YouTube pre-roll doesn’t come cheap. So next we add another number gleaned from our conversations with our studio friends – about $20 million to market the film.

Adding those numbers to the $90 million already spent brings the total cost of Batgirl to $120 million. So really all Batgirl needs to bring home from the theaters is 30 million bucks to offset its finishing and marking costs.

“ Even if Batgirl really was bad it can’t be any worse than Morbius and that pile managed to steal $160 million from the people of Earth.

Now you might be thinking $30 million is nothing in box office numbers and you’d be right. But it’s not quite so simple. Movie theaters don’t exhibit films for free. They take a cut of ticket sales which is usually about 50%. This means Batgirl actually needs to make $60 million at the box office to earn $30 million for the studio.

In short WBD would have to spend $30 million and split $60 million earned from the box office just so they can lose 90 million dollars on Batgirl to be in the same position they are by just killing the movie now.

For context this August Bullet Train made $65 million worldwide in its first four days. Meanwhile 2022 also saw The Northman a dense viking epic from indie auteur Robert Eggers bring in 68 million worldwide – and that movie very much did not feature the return of Michael Keaton’s Bruce Wayne .

But even if Batgirl really was bad it can’t be any worse than Morbius and that pile managed to steal $160 million from the people of Earth by the time it finished its meme-fueled re-release . Surely Batgirl could’ve kept up with Morbin’ Time in a race to be the biggest tax write-off.

Now had they released the film exclusively on HBO Max as they’d intended at $15 a month (that they don’t have to split with theater chains) it would’ve taken 2 million new subscribers to hit that $30 million mark. Or maybe just a million people subscribe and forget to cancel before the second billing cycle hits. But you know good luck proving that was because of Batgirl. In truth it’s more likely that even if somebody signs up for Batgirl they stick around for the other programming that they’re paying for… so streaming revenue gets intensely fuzzy very fast.

And remember this entire exercise is just to see what it would take for a movie to lose $90 million. Maybe the film would’ve outperformed the estimates we’ve made here if given the chance in theaters. Maybe it makes 100 million instead of 60 at the box office and you’re out 70 million instead of 90. That’s not out of the realm of possibility and in theory you’re then $20 million better off. So why not just release it?

This Industry Sucks

The industry has always been notorious for hiding profits. Wildly successful movies may never make a dime according to their balance sheets thanks to the infamous “Hollywood accounting.” So if a loss is what WBD needed there are time-honored ways to go about it.

To cherry-pick an example the balance sheet for Warners’ own Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix shows that the film lost some $160 million in 2007. Per Box Office Mojo  with a budget of $150 million the film brought in close to a billion dollars globally. So… I don’t know.

What this exercise seems to show however is that canceling Batgirl can’t have been about the money. Frankly based on these numbers it seems like Batgirl could’ve accidentally recouped its budget and then some. The financial benefit of killing the movie now is incidental to the decision a silver lining for a CFO somewhere.

“ More than anything what the cancellation of Batgirl seems to be is a new regime cleaning house and doing a hard reboot of the DCEU.

More than anything though what the cancellation of Batgirl seems to be is a new regime cleaning house and doing a hard reboot of the DCEU. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav was recently quoted as saying “This idea of expensive films going direct to streaming — we can’t find an economic case for it we can’t find an economic value to it so we’re making a strategic shift.” In addition to this emphasis on theatrical release over streaming for their DC properties had Zaslav felt the film was closer to an expensive episode of TV than a movie for the big screen it seems there would be more of a willingness to kill it.

Which are kind of two different answers but likely still only part of it. The other part resides in the depressing macroeconomics of 2022. If you haven’t been reading the news lately it sounds like an economic recession is on the horizon  and Zaslav and company may be betting on a tightening of belts in households worldwide where the first casualty may be streaming subscriptions. Meanwhile the film industry and theater chains have historically shown themselves to be recession-resistant at minimum and recession-proof if you’re willing to be generous.

The decision to cancel a whole movie this close to completion took everybody by surprise. It’s a drag to say the least. But while we’re grasping for some kind of logic behind it we can all look away from the financials. The “savings” they’re seeing by walking away from a $90 million investment is a drop in the bucket for a company that trades in the billions and more than that there are very realistic scenarios where the film could’ve made more than those savings. Regardless of the reasoning be it a strategic shift or a lack of faith in the product it’s fairly safe to say that money wasn’t a consideration. And respect for the artists who worked on Batgirl wasn’t a consideration either.

Anyway Leslie Grace and directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah and the craft service folks and the stunt people and the composer and any number of people that would’ve eventually found themselves in the credits – by the way main end credits you usually see in a superhero film? Those snazzy animated sequences can cost upwards of $300k so tack that on to the calculus – they all deserved better."

Unfortunately there are two vehicles that some motorists may attempt to get around: a school bus and a garbage truck. Both tend to slow traffic while performing necessary duties and are at risk of accidents if drivers are distracted.

“Safety is one of our core values. Keeping everyone including customers drivers and those in our community safe is our top priority” said WM Gulf Coast Safety Manager Tony Franco. “As we begin the new school year WM encourages drivers to take precautionary measures in order to keep our families team members and students safe on the road.”

Here are some tips to keep everyone safe as we head back to school:

Keep a safe distance from the truck – at least 15 feet. Never climb on the truck.

Vehicles like WM trucks make frequent stops and often back-up so don’t follow the truck closely while walking running biking or skating. Stay alert and listen for the back-up alarm with “beep-beep-beep” sounds.

There are several areas where the visibility is restricted for the driver. If you cannot see the driver’s eyes they most likely cannot see you.

It takes service vehicles about twice as long to stop as a passenger car. Always keep a safe distance from a truck.

Every WM truck is equipped with a back-up alarm. If you hear this sound or see the white back-up lights be sure to move out of the way of the truck.

While safety on the road is a top priority at WM so is being stewards of the environment. Every year schools produce millions of tons of waste that can either be recycled or reused from paper to discarded cafeteria food. WM would like to offer green tips for parents and students this school year:

Reduce the trash created by disposable bags sandwich bags and foil by packing lunches in washable reusable lunchboxes bags and containers.

Keep in mind that whole fruits and vegetables as snacks are healthier and better for the environment than packaged snacks.

Instead of purchasing individually wrapped snack-sized packages buy the larger size and pack snacks in reusable containers to save money and the environment.

When buying new supplies consider paper and notebooks made from recycled paper as these eco-friendly supply options are available at many large retailers.

“It was a pleasure that the St. Kitts and Nevis Solid Waste Management and Recycling Project was invited to make presentations on recycling to school children attending four summer camps in the month of July” said Ms Chang. “The camps were held and organised by the St. Kitts Yacht Club Creative Immersion Ministry of Tourism and the St. Kitts Sea Turtle Monitoring Network.”

The St. Kitts Yacht Club held a two-week sailing camp on the north end of the Frigate Bay Beach for children 5-17 years in the period July 4-15 and another outreach group on the 16th and National Dinghy Regatta between St. Kitts and Nevis on the 17th while in the period July 18-22 they did an aquatics camp.

“The last one was a mix with more time for kayaking/stand-up paddle-boarding swimming snorkelling and some additional activities of surfing and kite-board flying” said Commodore of the club and the senior national instructor Mr Nicholas Dupre. “A total of 22 kids attended the camp. Friday July 15 was the day the Solid Waste Management and Recycling Project officials visited.”

Representing the St. Kitts and Nevis Solid Waste Management and Recycling Project were Project Technician Mr Geofhani Gumbs and Volunteer from Taiwan Ms Cecilia Lai who educated the camp participants on the finer details of recycling as it relates to the items that can be recycled and those that cannot be recycled.

Secretary of the St. Kitts Yacht Club and coordinator of the camp Mrs. Lizbeth Burrell noted that the children played a fun puzzle game went through the 3 Rs of recycling which are Reduce Reuse Recycle and learnt what they can recycle.

In a Facebook post Mrs. Burrell noted that the participants also “learned of the drop-off locations (for recyclable material) and how what we do affect our marine animals the food we eat and our waters. They (kids) brought their recyclables and got their card towards getting prizes. Teaching our youths to conserve and protect their environment and to be the change they want to see.”

Another two-week camp Creative Immersion Kids Summer Camp which was held at Stapleton Garden in St. Peter’s in the period July 11-22 was attended by 21 children aged between ages 6 and 13 who came from across St. Kitts. It was organised by local entrepreneur Ms. Anastasia Elliot.

According to Ms. Elliot the purpose of the camp was to teach the children how to create entrepreneurship. This included learning skills activities that included jewellery pottery and how to make things organically. They did a number of entrepreneurship courses that exposed them to the need to know how to be able to create and run a business.

Officials from the St. Kitts and Nevis Solid Waste Management and Recycling Project were the guest speakers in the morning section on Thursday July 21. They were Manager Ms. Joyce Chang Project Technician Mr. Geofhani Gumbs and Volunteer from Taiwan Ms. Cecilia Lai.

“I wanted to put in some environmental aspect in what they are doing because every business generates trash and it is always important to have a company where you can do some recycling or give back to the environment” said Ms Elliot. “The lessons they learned on recycling today and how to take care of the environment were built in where they would have done environmental work on marine care and sea turtles were useful as they could build them into their businesses.”

The Green Tourism Camp was held at the St. Kitts Eco Park in the period Monday July 25 and Friday July 29 and the St. Kitts and Nevis Solid Waste Management and Recycling Project officials Ms. Joyce Chang Project Technician Mr. Geofhani Gumbs and Volunteer from Taiwan Ms. Cecilia Lai were on hand to talk to the participants on Wednesday July 27.

The Green Tourism Camp which is organised by the Projects Unit of the Ministry of Tourism had in attendance 40 schoolchildren aged 8-12 from four rural primary schools Sandy Point St. Paul’s Newton Ground and Dieppe Bay.

According to the Camp Organiser Tourism Education Officer Ms Samantha Boone the main objective of the camp was for the kids to learn about reducing reusing and recycling. The camp’s slogan was based on the Four Green Ps which are: Protecting our People Plants and Planet.

The final camp where the St. Kitts and Nevis Solid Waste Management and Recycling Project officials educated the participants on recycling was the week-long St. Kitts Sea Turtle Monitoring Network Annual Sea Turtle Camp. It was held at the Sugar Bay Club in Frigate Bay. The three officials visited and talked to the participants on Thursday July 28.

Director of St. Kitts Sea Turtle Monitoring Network Dr. Kimberly Stewart explained that the camp which is held every July since 2007 targets children in the age bracket 12-16 from the entire island of St. Kitts. She however added that they have ended up with a wide range as this year they had kids as young as six years.

According to Dr Stewart the subject of the camp was sea turtles where they learned about the different species of sea turtles in the world and both in St. Kitts and Nevis. The participants went through things like nesting behaviour and especially threats to sea turtles that will be natural or human based threats and then how they could help the sea turtles.

“We wanted to emphasise marine debris because it is a big problem for sea turtles in the form of ingesting it or becoming entangled in it and their environment” explained Dr Stewart. “So this is how the recycling programme ties in for us as well because we know if we prevent that pollution from reaching the ocean we can help the turtles as well. So we are really trying to emphasise this week by making sure they sort their garbage and anything that is plastic or metal they are kept to the side so that we can participate in this activity today.”

During the camps the participants were encouraged to bring with them items for recycling and according to Ms Joyce Chang a total of 244.45 lbs. were collected at the Green Tourism Camp 18.82 lbs. were collected at the Creative Immersion Kids Camp 11.83 lbs. were collected at the Sea Turtle Camp and 4.29 lbs. at the St. Kitts Yacht Club Camp.

“Children are the future and any organisation that gives them the opportunity to take charge of what affects their environment needs a strong commendation from all” said Ms. Chang. “This project was conceptualised in line with the international community’s rising awareness of the importance of solid waste management as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 – ‘Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcmljYW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMTMvd2FzdGUtcGlja2Vycy1hdC1rZW55YW4tZHVtcC1mYWNlLWNhbmNlci1hbmQtaW5mZXJ0aWxpdHkv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWZyaWNhbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDgvMTMvd2FzdGUtcGlja2Vycy1hdC1rZW55YW4tZHVtcC1mYWNlLWNhbmNlci1hbmQtaW5mZXJ0aWxpdHkv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste pickers at Kenyan dump face cancer and infertility,"Acrid smoke billows from the mountain of waste at the Dandora rubbish dump in Nairobi.

Plastic glass even medical waste - it's fresh pickings for the Marabou stalks and the people scavenging through the dump looking for recyclable materials.

The women sift through the waste - most with bare hands - for their livelihood.

A kilo of recyclable plastic waste goes for 17 shilling (0.14 USD) per kilogram at the dumpsite.

A bag of recyclable plastic ranges from 5 to 50 shilling (0.042 - 0.42 USD) depending on the size.

""We usually look for plastic bottles carton boxes gunny bags bones and pig food. Yet we do this without protective gloves or gumboots so we sometimes get cuts from glass. We are really suffering"" says Mariam Makeba an informal waste picker.

But cuts from glass are the least concern for these women who feel they have option other than to work at the dump.

The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) warned that the Dandora dump has posed a serious health threat to those working and living nearby as far back as 2007.

And according to a report by The Endocrine Society and IPEN ((International Pollutants Elimination Network) in December 2020 there is evidence of human health impacts from many chemicals in common plastics including alterations to both male and female reproductive development and infertility.

Mother of six Winfred Wanjira spends her working days filling her sack with recyclable plastics to make enough money to feed her children.

""Sometimes you might unexpectedly lose your pregnancy. But when you change your environment you can have a successful pregnancy. However when you try to change your environment you may lack work opportunities and your children become hungry - you have no other option but to come back"" she says.

""Medical professionals have advised us to stop working at the dumpsite. But where would I go if I stopped working here?""

24-year-old waste picker Joyce Wangari says she is also experiencing issues with her reproductive health.

""I usually receive my period after every three months and yet I am not on contraceptives. However at one point I had a head injury and had to change my environment for three months - I also got my period in those three months"" says Joyce Wangari informal waste picker.

The Dandora dumpsite is an informal workplace to about 10000 women children and a few men who scavenge through the piles of rubbish daily according to a Concern Worldwide report from 2012.

The site was deemed full in 1996 but still scores of pickers roam.

And despite an Environment and Land court ordering the closure of the dumpsite in July 2021 they continue to operate.

The UNEP warn that air pollution created by the Dandora landfill poses a wide range of health risks for both workers and the community nearby.

Many materials that end up as waste contain toxic substances and people end up inhaling the noxious fumes from routine waste burning and methane fires says the organisation.

A UNEP report titled 'Implications of the Dandora Municipal Dumping Site in Nairobi Kenya' - states that skin disorders cancers respiratory abnormalities and blood disorders are just some of the public health effects that can be brought about by environmental pollution emanating from the dump site.

Heavy metals at high concentrations as is the case in contaminated environments can result in public health impacts it goes on to say.

""Lead and mercury are heavy metals and most of the time the women who are working at the dumpsite they are actually inhaling and at the same time ingesting this particular heavy metals. It is not only affecting reproductive health but it is also affecting the women and most women are actually ending up with cancer. Remember mercury is one of the major metals associated with cancer. Lead the same"" explains public health nurse at Maasai Mara University Jacqueline Naulikha.

For mercury samples collected from the waste dump exhibited a value of 46.7 ppm while those collected along the river bank registered a value of 18.6 ppm. Both of these values greatly exceeded the WHO acceptable exposure level of 2 ppm.

The concentration of lead in the soil samples ranged from 50-590 ppm. Soil samples from within the waste dump manifested a value of 13500 ppm. This is a clear indication that the dumpsite is the major source of high lead levels found in the surrounding environment according to UNEP.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency has set the maximum contaminant level goal for lead in drinking water at zero because lead can be harmful to human health even at low exposure levels.

""So if a woman gets cancer and she is not aware that she has cancer most of the time the first thing that is affected is her menstrual cycle. This could be one of the first signs heavy bleeding. When she has heavy bleeding and that is irregular it could be an early warning sign that this particular woman is actually having cancer especially cancer of the reproductive parts"" says Naulikha.

""It may affect the fertile period. When a woman is ovulating and ready to get pregnant this is going to be affected and you may get that most women who work in Dandora most of them may end up being childless because of the effect of mercury and lead"" she adds.

In a bid to improve waste management Kenya's 2021 Sustainable Waste Management Bill outlined objectives for county governments - to establish waste management infrastructure to promote source segregation collection reuse and provide central collection centres for materials that can be recycled

And on March 2nd this year (2022) the United Nations Environment Assembly decided to initiate negotiations for a global agreement to end plastic pollution at its meeting in Nairobi.

Dorothy Otieno project officer for programs on plastics and waste management at the Centre for Environmental Justice and Development (CEJAD) explains the changes this could bring.

""The resolution that was passed by UNEA to end plastic pollution one of the key benefits that we have been able to see from that is waste pickers being recognised. So the Intergovernmental negotiating committees are required to learn from the experiences of waste pickers because they have so much information just by working in the dumpsites"" she says.

""And they are also recognised as people who play an integral part in the formal waste management system. So with this we are hoping that countries like Kenya to be among this (inaudible) championing for the rights of waste pickers and formalised and included in all policy and waste management processes.""

A glimmer of hope for the future but today even knowing the severe health impacts coming to this dump poses the women the children and the men keep coming. For them it is the only way to feed their families.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2d1cmdhb24vd2FzdGUtZGlzcG9zYWwtbXVuaWNpcGFsLWNvcnBvcmF0aW9uLWd1cnVncmFtLXZpc2l0cy01LW1vcmUtc2l0ZXMtdG8taWRlbnRpZnktbGFuZC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MzUzMjUyMi5jbXPSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9ndXJnYW9uL3dhc3RlLWRpc3Bvc2FsLW11bmljaXBhbC1jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbi1ndXJ1Z3JhbS12aXNpdHMtNS1tb3JlLXNpdGVzLXRvLWlkZW50aWZ5LWxhbmQvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzNTMyNTIyLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste disposal: Municipal Corporation Gurugram visits 5 more sites to identify land,"GURUGRAM: MCG officials have visited five sites — Basai Daultabad  Nainwal Kadarpur and Hyatpur— in Gurugram to identify land for fresh waste disposal and processing.Though Basai and Daultabad are found to be the most suitable ones officials said the land available in Basai belongs to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA).Officials said they would soon prepare a proposal and review of the five sites visited and table the same at a meeting slated to be chaired by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar .The CM in his last meeting held in Chandigarh on July 29 directed the civic body to scout for land for fresh waste disposal since Bandhwari is now overburdened.“The land available in Daultabad is spread across 16 acres. It is a low-lying area however the site can be prepared for waste disposal by filling it with soil"" said a senior MCG official privy to the matter. ""The land in Nainwal is adjacent to a defence site. For Kadarpur the route to the site goes through a village which won’t be feasible for transportation of waste.”“We have also inspected the sites in Hayatpur and Basai with the latter being located near the construction and demolition (C&D) waste plant” the official said.MCG officials said that they would soon hold a meeting with their counterparts in the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) “as around 92 acres of land in Mohabbatabad is also available in the neighbouring district"".Last month CM Manohar Lal Khattar directed the MCG commissioner to find a new site for fresh waste dumping and processing in Manesar and Faridabad too.""It was also directed at the meeting that land can be made available to the concessionaire for the construction of a waste-to-energy plant at Bandhwari for which fresh waste has to be diverted to an alternative site"" the official said.It was also emphasised at the meeting that the waste-to-energy plant should be made operational by August 31 2023 as per the contract for which MCG should handover 10 acres at the landfill site after the monsoon. For this to happen MCG officials said fresh waste disposal in Bandhwari has to stop.“We will have another meeting with the CM in which the proposal of these sites will be tabled. We will file the status of these sites in the proposal for the higher-ups to decide on the site for waste disposal” the official added.Every day around 2000 tonnes of waste is dumped at the landfill site. The officials said that around 32 to 35 lakh tonnes of legacy waste is still at the landfill. MCG has already given the contract to process four lakh tonnes of waste to two private companies. The MCG officials said that more tenders will be invited after getting approval from the state government for waste processing at Bandhwari. The Urban Local Bodies (ULB) minister Kamal Gupta had visited the landfill in May earlier this year and had said that he will put forward the proposal of an alternative site for the disposal of Gurugram’s fresh waste before the Haryana chief minister."

The Halomonas bluephagenesis TD01 strain investigated here was isolated from Aydingkol Lake in Xinjiang China in 20092 and has been under continuing development for biomanufacturing since its isolation234567822. E. coli (K12/MG1655) was processed in identical manner for each process and used as a control for comparison against public datasets.

Genome sequencing and proteome library generation

Genomic DNA for H. bluephagenesis TD01 strain was extracted and purified using the Monarch genomic DNA purification kit (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The gDNA was then sheared using a gTube (Covaris) and prepared for sequencing following the SMRTbell Express Template Preparation Kit 2.0 protocol. Sequencing data were obtained using the Sequel system (Pacific Biosciences) with a 10-hour acquisition. De novo assembly of the TD01 genome was performed using the Microbial assembly algorithm in SMRT Link which generated a single circular contig assembly representing the complete TD01 genome. The assembly was analysed and annotated with the PATRIC online tool23.

Media

Luria broth as standard for E. coli and adjusted to 5% sodium chloride pH 9 for H. bluephagenesis was prepared as follows. LB Broth Miller was prepared from powder (Formedium 25 g L−1 comprising tryptone 10 g L−1 yeast extract 5 g L−1 and sodium chloride 10 g L−1 pH 7.0). For H. bluephagenesis this was adjusted to 5% sodium chloride (additional 40 g L−1) and pH adjusted with sodium hydroxide (5 M 4 mL L−1 to pH 9). Liquid media was sterilised by autoclave. For plates agar (15 g L−1) was added to the appropriate sterile low- or high-salt media described above and heated in a microwave (30% power 20 min) then poured into plates and allowed to cool in a laminar flow hood. Plates were stored (5 °C) for up to four weeks prior to use.

Plate cell cultures

Cells from a glycerol stock were aseptically inoculated onto agar media plates prepared as above. Inoculated plates were incubated (37 °C overnight) then transferred to cold storage (4 °C). Colonies were taken to inoculate liquid cell cultures see below within four days.

Liquid cell cultures

A single bacterial colony of either E. coli K12 or H. bluephagenesis TD01 was transferred aseptically to media (50 mL) of the required type (see above) in a 250 mL conical flask. Cultures were incubated (37 °C 200 rpm) and OD 600 monitored.

Pellet collection for whole cell analysis

When OD 600 was 0.3–0.6 which prior experiments indicated growth to be in the late log/early stationary phase the culture (450 µL) was recovered by placing into pre-weighed 5 mL microfuge tubes on ice and pelleted by centrifugation (3200 × g 10 min 4 °C). The supernatant was discarded. Wet mass pellet was determined by difference with tube empty mass. Pellets were frozen (−20 °C) for later whole cell digestion.

Pellet wet to dry mass estimation

A set of six pellets each of E. coli and H. bluephagenesis TD01 were collected as above. Pellets were heated (70 °C overnight) to evaporate water. The dry mass of the pellet was then determined. Pellets were subject to a further six hours of drying and re-weighting to insure dry mass had reached an end point. The relationship between wet and dry mass was established by linear regression.

Cell pellet lysis

Frozen pellets were simultaneously resuspended and defrosted in S-trap lysis buffer (7% SDS 70 mM TEAB pH 7.55 3 µL buffer per mg wet mass of pellet). DNA was removed by addition of bensonase (Sigma/Merk 1 µL) and sample vortexed briefly. If required a second addition of bensonase removed any remaining viscosity. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation (4200 × g 2 min).

Cell fractionation to periplasm and plasma membrane

Bacteria were cultured as above. At OD 600 0.3–0.6 an OD10 sample (vol in mL = 10/ OD 600 ) was recovered to a 5 mL microfuge tube and pelleted (3200 × g 10 min 4 °C). Working on ice pellet was resuspended in ice cold “buffer 1” (500 µL 500 mM sucrose 5 mM EDTA for Halomonas only – 5% sodium chloride 100 mM Tris-acetate pH 8.2). Lysozyme (40 µL 2 mg mL−1) was added to the suspension quickly followed by dilution with further ice-cold water (500 µL) then incubated (5 min on ice). Magnesium sulfate (20 µL 1 M) was added stripping the outer membrane and periplasm from the bacteria leaving intact spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (14000 rpm 10 min 4 °C); both pellet (spheroblast) and supernatant (periplasm) were retained. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh microfuge tube and remaining debris pelleted by centrifugation (14000 rpm 10 min 4 °C) the top fraction of the resulting supernatant (500 µL) was combined with 2 × S-trap SDS-lysis buffer (500 µL 10% SDS 100 mM TEAB pH 7.55). Spheroplasts were washed twice by gentle resuspension in ice-cold “buffer 2” (1 mL 250 mM sucrose 120 mM MgSO 4  50 mM Tris-acetate pH 8.2). Spheroplasts were resuspended in ice-cold “buffer 3” (1 mL 2.5 mM EDTA 50 mM Tris-acetate pH 8.2) supplemented with bensoase (Sigma 1 µL 250 units/µL). Spheroplasts were disrupted by sonication on ice (3 × 15 s burst 25% power 3 mm diameter tipped probe). The membranes and cytoplasm were separated by ultracentrifugation (202000 × g 30 min 4 °C) following which the supernatant containing the cytoplasm was discarded the membrane resuspended in “buffer 3” and ultracentrifugation repeated to produce a clean membrane fraction which was resuspended in 1 × S-trap lysis buffer (2 mL 5% SDS 500 mM TEAB pH 7.55).

Protein digest

Total protein was quantified by micro-BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein was digested with the s-trap mini kit (Protifi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions the sample already being in the recommended SDS-lysis buffer (see above). Briefly sample volume was taken to give 1–5 mg total protein reduced with TCEP (50 mM final concentration) and incubated (60 °C 30 min) alkylated with iodoacetamide (40 mM final concentration) and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The sample was acidified with phosphoric acid (1/10 vol 12%) and diluted in s-trap binding buffer (7 vols 90% methanol 100 mM TEAB). The sample was loaded onto s-trap in cycles of 190 µL aliquots followed by centrifugation (4000 × g 1 min). The s-trap was washed (4 × 150 µL) with centrifugation as for loading. Protein was digested by addition of trypsin (Promega 20 µL 0.5 µg µL−1) in digestion buffer (50 mM TEAB) and incubated (47 °C 1 hr) in a water bath.

Offline high pH fractionation

Whole cell lysate digests were fractionated by offline high-pH fractionation using an Agilent 1200 series LC system with a C-18 reverse phase column (Agilent ZORBAX 300Extend-C18 4.6 × 150 mm 3.5 µm particle size) in a column oven (45 °C) with mobile phases A (Water 0.1% ammonium hydroxide) and B (acetonitrile 0.1% ammonium hydroxide). The system was equilibrated (1 mL min−1 3% B) the sample injected and system held at starting conditions for 75 min or until the UV trace at 214 nm had returned to baseline. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient (25 min 0.75 mL min−1 3–27% B) followed by washing the column (5 min 0.75 mL min−1 50% B) then a further wash (5 min 0.75 mL min−1 100% B) followed by re-equilibration with starting conditions. Peptides fractions were collected (9–40 min run time 0.35 min per fraction) into a 96 well plate. The plate was lyophilised samples were resuspended in LC-MS loading buffer (3% acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid iRT peptides) and fractions pooled in threes taken from begging middle and end of the run. Pooled samples were processed by LC-MS (see below).

Biognosis iRT for retention time calibration and quantification

Retention time index peptides24 (JPT) were spiked into samples prior to LC-MS to enable both retention time normalisation and TOP3 quantification (see Table 1). The peptides comprise a common community standard set used for such normalisation. Combined volumes of sample iRT stock and injection volumes were adjusted so that the amount injected into the LC-MS column was held constant between samples. Of the 11 iRT peptides five were injected at approximately 434 fmol on column and used for TOP3 quantification as indicated in the table.

Table 1 Table of iRT standard peptides. Full size table

LC-MS

Mass spectrometry data were acquired on a Waters Xevo G2S QToF coupled to a nanoAquity liquid chromatography system in trap-elute mode. The sample was injected onto a trap column (Waters nanoEase 100 Å 5 µm 180 µm × 20 mm) with 3% acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid at 0.6 mL min−1 then eluted through an analytical column (Waters nanoEase M/Z Peptide CSH C18 130 Å 1.7 µm 75 µm × 150 mm) with an 80 minute linear gradient of 3–45% acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid at 0.6 µL min−1 followed by column wash and re-equilibration for a total injection run time of 90 min. Data were acquired in MSe mode with leucine enkephalin lockspray mass correction at 60 s intervals over m/z 50–2000 with 1 s scan times low energy scans were acquired with 5 V collision energy and high energy scans with a ramp of 20–35 V collision energy.

Data processing

The workflow for spectral library generation was scripted using gnu-make. Both the script and detailed accompanying documentation are included in the Pride submission and available on git-hub (https://github.com/M-Russell/HalomonasProcessingRepository). The documentation describes in detail the proteomics workflow managed by the gnu-make script including every command line used to process raw data to final outputs. In brief proprietary Waters processing tools Apex3d and peptdie3d were used to process Waters raw MSe data into mass spectra. These spectra were then processed through two separate pathways. One route merged the spectral data for each species H. bluephagenesis and E. coli then searched and quantified proteins using Waters IADB search program with TOP3 quantification. The other route took spectral data in mgf format exported from the peptide3d program and processed the spectra through the Trans-Proteomic-Pipeline25 matching spectra to peptides with X!Tandem26 controlling for false discovery rates using Peptide Prophet iProphet and Mayu27 and producing a spectral library with spectrast in a readily accessible format directly compatible with the widely used Skyline28 software. The spectral library was subsequently converted into tab delimited version compatible with Openswath29 and Sciex peakview software. The quality of the spectral library was assessed with the DIAlib-QC tool. Proteins quantified via TOP3 quantification with IADB were filtered for those identified at less than 1% FDR by Maye.

KEGG orthology annotation

The protein fasta database was broken into four parts and each part was uploaded to KEGG BlastKOALA30 KO assignment tool (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/mapper/assign_ko.html) with the family/genus to be searched set to Halomonas (2745). The resulting tables of matched protein annotation KO number were concatenated together.

KEGG pathway reconstruction

Kegg KO numbers assigned to proteins above were filtered for those assigned to quantified proteins. This list was submitted to the Kegg Reconstruction Tool31 (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/mapper). The resulting “Pathway” and “Module” tables were copied to excel files and are included as supplementary information.

Tabulated summary of baseline expression

A tabulated summary of the data acquired above was prepared for H. bluephagenesis as follows. The sequence annotations from each of the protein sequences in the fasta file were put in the left hand column. This tabulation was followed by columns indicating first if peptides from the protein are present in the spectral library which also indicates evidence of protein expression at the protein level and second if the protein was quantified. Where protein sequences were matched to Kegg entries via BlastKOALA as described above details of the KO number and description were entered in the next two columns. The final column contained the estimate of protein expression in mmol per gram dry mass of bacterial pellet. This estimate was obtained by adjusting the TOP3 estimate of protein amount in fmol on column for the fraction of total protein taken for the digest the fraction of the digest taken for offline fractionation and the fraction of fractionated material injected on the LC-MS system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpuYmMuY28uem0vbmV3cy9sdXNha2Etd2F0ZXItY28tdG8tc3RhcnQtd2F0ZXItcmF0aW9uaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lusaka water co to start water rationing ~,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.znbc.co.zm', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/lusaka-water-co-to-start-water-rationing/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019D84B01270>, 'Connection to www.znbc.co.zm timed out.

The once happy-go-lucky queen of daytime’s financial troubles reportedly remain at a standstill. Williams had numerous health complications lost her television show and has had trouble accessing her own money from Wells Fargo after the financial instituion froze her accounts. Since then she’s subsequently being placed under financial guardianship. She’s reportedly still unable to access the funds and has been relying on friends to get her through.

Wendy is fed up with Wells Fargo

In Jan. 2022 Wells Fargo froze the account because they were worried that Williams had been the subject to “financial exploitation dementia or undue influence” despite her denying show.

Reports surfaced that she would have access after a New York Judge designated a guardian to oversee her funds but that has yet to fruition.

Per tabloid The Sun it is rumored she still can’t access the money that her staff is working for free because she cannot pay them personally.

“She gets money through the financial guardian but it’s not like the level of money Wendy Williams would need to get by in New York City. Her manager is footing the bill for a lot of her personal upkeep right now” a source told them.

In a previous video Williams addressed the matter.

“My thing is that I’ve been asking questions about my money” she said at the time. “And when I began asking questions about my money suddenly [my former financial advisor] Lori Schiller has no response regarding my money. I want my money. This is not fair. And Wells Fargo has no questions and answers with regarding my money. This is not fair.”

“I want my money. This is not fair” she previously said according to ET Online. “…Wells Fargo has no questions and answers regarding my money. This is not fair. And Lori Schiller and Wells Fargo has this guardianship petition about keeping me away from my money. This is not right and this is not fair.”

“I know for a fact that Bernie Young used my American Express card to hire an attorney to file a petition against me” she continued accusing her former manager. “That was done with my American Express card…Then there’s this person….A former doctor…had medical information about me that I never even got! It was sent over the Lori Schiller. So I haven’t gotten this stuff. I fired this doctor and again all I want to know is where is my money? This is not right! And certainly this is not fair…Wells Fargo has used all this stuff to create the guardianship over me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzE0L2h1ZHNvbi15YXJkcy1uZXctb2ZmaWNlLXRvd2VyLWJvb21pbmctd2l0aC1uZXctc2lnbmluZ3MtZGVzcGl0ZS10b3VnaC1tYXJrZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hudson Yards new office tower booming with new signings despite tough market,"You’d never know it from some recent bad publicity but Related Companies’ Hudson Yards is on a roll. If you’re surprised to hear that the proof is in the enduring and growing strength of the office towers.

For all its glamorous shops restaurants and performing arts programs Hudson Yards is first and foremost an office complex with four huge towers comprising 8.6 million square feet. Although privately-held Related led by chairman Stephen M. Ross is shy about sharing data several brokers helped us to estimate that all the expensive office space is about 95% leased or sold.

At the newest tower 50 Hudson Yards which opens later this year a bunch of large deals recently closed that totaled a whopping 285000 square feet in a sluggish market.

The new space commitments bring the tower to around 84% leased. The most impressive is a new lease of 95000 square feet for Vista Equity Partners. Asking rents for the remaining available space are in the $175-$240-per-square-foot range brokers said.

The complex’s largest tenants and commercial condo owners include Meta Warner Bros. BlackRock Discovery Tapestry Wells Fargo L’Oreal and Point 72. Most employees are at their desks too. Although Related doesn’t say so for the record sources tell us that physical office occupancy at the site is up to about 60% compared with the Manhattan average between 40% and 43%.

It’s too easy to lose track of Hudson Yards’ phenomenal and ongoing success given negative publicity over weakness in the retail mall where Related is converting Neiman Marcus’ former seven floors to offices and the closing to the public of the tourist-magnet Vessel following four suicide leaps.

The superfast SSD which is compatible for use in the PS5 console can hit read speeds of up to 7000 MB/s. The best deal currently on offer is for the 2 TB variant with heatsink which is up to 53-60% off depending on region.

4 Reviews

PlayStation 5 owners looking for additional storage for their sparkling Sony console should pop over to Amazon and have a look at the amazing deals the giant retailer currently has on WD_BLACK SSDs from Western Digital. The brand offers the first officially licensed M.2 SSD for use with the PS5 with the drives being able to keep up with the blazing-fast speeds of the console’s storage. The WD_BLACK SN850 comes with or without a heatsink and is offered in 500 GB 1 TB and 2 TB capacity variants. The deal is clearly for the original version of the drive that comes with an orange light while the new official PS5-compatible model comes with an appropriate light-blue LED.

The biggest discount for US buyers at the time of writing is a whopping 53% off the 2 TB version of the WD_BLACK SN850 with heatsink. This brings the price down from US$549.99 to a bargain price of US$259.99. It’s likely there are limited amounts of stock available so PS5 users in requirement for extra storage should certainly act quickly. Shoppers should be sure to actually select the option for “SSD” or “SSD w/Heatsink” and NOT the option for “SSD w/Heatsink for PS5” as it appears it is only the older non-official version of the SN850 that has been discounted. The price for the 1 TB model with heatsink has also been reduced by a considerable 49%.

Over at Amazon UK there seem to be some of the lowest prices ever for the PS5-compatible WD_BLACK SN850. Lucky buyers could actually get up to 60% off here if they manage to find some available stock with the 2 TB model with heatsink going for £199.98 down from an RRP of £500.99. The 1 TB model seems to be out of stock at the moment while the 500 GB drive doesn’t appear to be discounted. The 2-TB WD_BLACK SN850 offers up to 7000 MB/s read speeds and over 5000 MB/s write speeds so buyers can expect to be well-served by the SSD once it is correctly fitted into their PS5 (or PC).

The executive will start in early September and bring experience scaling an ethical apparel brand the company said. Fisher will continue to play a central role in product design and brand development and will remain as the company’s board chair.

The appointment ends a near-year-long search for a new chief executive at the company which Fisher founded in 1984. Williams will be charged with developing the brand’s strategy and operations following the pandemic. The brand generated revenue of $241 million in 2021 down from $393 million pre-pandemic in 2019 though profits have increased over that period the company said.

While Fisher is the majority shareholder the rest of the business has been employee-owned since 2006.

In the US the company is not only known as a sustainability pioneer but also for its unwavering minimalist style — a subtle untrendy look not readily available elsewhere in the mass market. In culture Eileen Fisher has been referenced everywhere from the HBO series Girls to online memes.

Eileen Fisher is stepping down as CEO of her eponymous fashion brand. Lisa Williams Patagonia’s chief product officer will take over the role in early September.

Fisher will remain involved in the brand’s product design while Williams will lead daily operations accounting for both sustainable growth and responsible business practices.

“I’m in the midst of building the blueprint so the company is at a place where it can stand on its own” says Fisher. That blueprint speaks to the Eileen Fisher brand’s sustainable timeless approach to fashion as well as its circular business model. “It’s time to have someone else lead it.”

Since launching her brand in 1984 Fisher has become one of the industry’s leading proponents of sustainability outspoken on fashion’s role in textile waste and overproduction as well as the need for a circular supply chain. Eileen Fisher was one of the first fashion brands to launch a take-back scheme to promote recycling when it introduced its Renew programme in 2009 as well as the Eileen Fisher Tiny Factory where textile waste is upcycled into new products. Fisher also heads up the Eileen Fisher Foundation her company’s philanthropic arm which in July teamed up with sustainable design and technology consultancy firm Pentatonic on a report on circular fashion models meant to act as an open playbook for the rest of the industry.

In addition to overseeing design her continued involvement with her company will include helping to guide branding and messaging. She’ll also continue to lead the foundation and she plans to continue to advocate for sustainable fashion. “I think of the company as a force for good. That’s something I’m proud of” says Fisher.

At Patagonia Williams was promoted to the role of chief product officer in 2015 where she oversaw the entire lifecycle of Patagonia products from design to production merchandising and inventory management. In her new role she’ll lead the brand’s forward trajectory as a leader in sustainability while also managing what Fisher considers “good growth” as well as profitability. “Delivering appropriate growth within a circular business model that finds the right balance between producing and selling new product alongside used and repurposed is the challenge for all of us” says Williams. “Eileen Fisher has an authentic and long time passion for doing business the right way and today’s customers are looking to support businesses rooted in responsibility.”

“It’s hard to make sense of [growth] as a sustainable company — our values problems with consumption and overproduction” Fisher says. “The industry needs massive change and to be more sustainable and I think with the combination of Lisa and I the foundation and the company there’s a lot more that we can do to help the industry.”

In delivering $1.6 million to Roger Williams University for shellfish aquaculture Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse say that they are partnering with the university to develop smart strategies and direct support to make shellfish farms stronger and more productive and help new shellfish aquaculture businesses start up across Rhode Island.



Rhode Island is home to more than 80 oyster leases and 41 companies. In fiscal year 2022 appropriations law Senators Reed and Whitehouse secured a $1.6 million earmark for RWU to provide support for shellfish aquaculture farmers in Rhode Island through aquaculture research resources and legal services. RWU says that its leadership in shellfish and marine fish aquaculture has made it a go-to resource for established and aspiring shellfish farmers who take oyster farming courses and consult with university experts on growing operations bivalve diseases legal questions on siting business startup and expansion.

“Shellfish aquaculture is becoming an integral part of our coastal ecosystem’s biodiversity environmental stewardship food security and economy. Each year the shellfish aquaculture community continues to grow employing hundreds of Rhode Islanders and bringing in millions of dollars in sales” said Senator Reed. “We want it to grow responsibly and sustainably. We salute the team here at Roger Williams University. CEED offers students and people from the community a world-class education in oyster management – it’s like Oyster Farming 101. From critical research that ensures both human health and coastal health to providing practical support for launching a new business to technical feedback on what oyster farmers need to succeed Roger Williams has become a go-to resource for Rhode Islanders.” “Aquaculture is one of the pillars of Rhode Island’s Blue Economy so it’s fitting that Roger Williams University has become a one stop shop for current and aspiring aquaculture farmers” said Senator Whitehouse. “Senator Reed and I were glad to deliver federal funding to support the University’s programmes to sustainably grow the industry create jobs and ensure that the Ocean State continues to produce the world’s best oysters.” Shellfish aquaculture with Senators Reed and Whitehouse In addition to supporting RWU’s continued advancements in shellfish aquaculture science through its Center for Economic and Environmental Development (CEED) and sharing knowledge on Rhode Island-specific ecosystems and issues with shellfish farmers and the public the funding will expand its aquaculture operations to raise and distribute four million oyster seeds annually for Rhode Island oyster farmers in a dedicated upweller system on its waterfront learning platform. These specialised tanks are a critical step in successfully growing oysters during their early life stage and Roger Williams will be making this important part of the growing process more accessible to local farmers.

Portions of the funding will purchase equipment to establish a histology lab to support the development of coastal resilience through shellfish aquaculture disease and pollutant testing and purchase new analytical equipment for a chemistry lab which will play a central role in education research and training to assess and promote aquatic ecosystem health. It will also support RWU Law School’s Marine Affairs Institute home of the Rhode Island Sea Grant Legal Programme to provide legal services and policy resources to communities interested in shellfish aquaculture. Roger Williams University is unique in being able to provide both the aquaculture knowledge and legal expertise required to develop a thriving oyster farming industry. While the university’s mission is to conduct leading research that provides new understanding techniques and resources – and to bring that knowledge to the world it is also to actively engage undergraduate students and law students in research at every step to ensure that the next generations of scientists legal experts and entrepreneurs have the experience and skills to continue making advancements in the blue economy in Rhode Island and around the globe.

WEST JORDAN — Robert Bartholomew runs his fingers through the bristles of a massive cloth brush inside a Mister Car Wash tunnel.

This brush a tool to help clean off the 550 to 1000 vehicles that come through this location daily is temporarily off at this moment to reduce the noise inside the tunnel while there's a lull in traffic on a recent morning.

""If you feel it it's less of a cloth and more of a kind of foam texture here"" says Bartholomew a regional manager of Mister Car Wash before shifting his focus to some of the custom-made nozzles this particular car wash site uses.

Robert Bartholomew regional manager of Mister Car Wash Utah talks about getting wrap brushes wet enough to optimize contact with vehicles moving through Mister Car Wash in West Jordan on Tuesday. The car wash company says it has reduced its water use by 30%. (Photo: Kristin Murphy Deseret News)

These two components he says have been altered recently to function more effectively with less water than what the company may have used a few years ago. He slowly moves down the tunnel to a high-pressure water system which he adds has been modified angularly to help clean vehicles efficiently without as much water too.

Juan Moncada the company's director of operations for a handful of Western states including Utah quickly interjects to point out that it's during this stage that excess soapy water is recycled and reused in the cleaning process.

""This trench actually goes from (inside the tunnel) to resettling tanks where the settlement starts to settle and we're able to reclaim the water that's remaining and so then that water is repurposed and actually used to clean the vehicle"" he explains as the machines restart for a sedan pulling through the tunnel. ""The city water is only used mainly when mixed with the chemistry or to rinse the vehicle but even that water makes its way into our trench back into the settling tanks and gets recycled.""

This is the complex process all happening behind the scenes while customers roll in to clean their vehicles. Customers aren't aware that they are moving past three massive tanks of stored reverse osmosis and rejected reverse osmosis water in a room next to the tunnel which is where the excess water ultimately travels to. These tanks that supply water are used in different components of the car-cleaning process mainly after the initial washing chemical is applied.

However this is a process that Mister Car Wash executives say they also began retooling in Utah last summer as the weight of one of the state's worst droughts on record — and the region's 20-year megadrought — fell on water supply concerns.

Utah's water goes to all sorts of places from farms to drinking water lawns and industrial uses. But what about the water cleaning off vehicles?

How much water does it take to clean a vehicle? And why do car wash companies care so much about it?

Conserving at the car wash

There are several reasons why experts say you should wash your vehicle on a regular basis. It can help reduce corrosion and improve fuel efficiency according to the International Carwash Association. Megan Everett senior director of communications at Mister Car Wash adds that it also reduces the odds of dirt and other filth washing off and going into a storm drain which may flow into streams rivers and lakes.

However cleaning a car can take lots of water. The association estimates the use as somewhere between 15 and 85 gallons per vehicle depending on the method of cleaning. The demand increases quickly when hundreds of cars show up to be cleaned daily.

The association's ""golden standard"" for conservation is using about 40 gallons of fresh water or less per car. Mister Car Wash was already a little below that benchmark in Utah before last year Everett said. With Utah's worsening drought she said the Beehive State seemed like the best place to try out new ways to cut back water.

The company began adjusting its model at 15 Utah locations using new and more efficient nozzles and brushes as well as an improved reclamation system.

This ultimately helped cut another 30% of their freshwater use according to Everett. She added that the changes have saved an estimated 2 million gallons of fresh water every month. This new model is also being used at two new locations that weren't included in their pilot program.

Other car wash companies have also touted these types of water-saving measures especially the reverse osmosis reclamation method — something Bartholomew calls an industry standard at this point. For example Quick Quack Car Wash says its water reclamation system can capture as much as 99% of the water it uses which allows it to clean vehicles with as little as 15 gallons of water.

This is compared to 100 gallons of water it may take to wash a car at home; the International Carwash Association's estimate there is based on a standard garden hose that uses 10 gallons per minute running for 10 minutes.

We are very well aware that if we want to sustain our position as responsible stewards we're going to have to create and find ways not just to keep doing what we're doing but even better. –Juan Moncada director of operations for Western states at Mister Car Wash

It's worth noting that the Utah Division of Water Resources has yet to vet Mister Car Wash's water conservation figures — or any of its competitors for that matter. But Shelby Ericksen the division's conservation manager said in a statement to KSL.com that she is optimistic about companies willing to find solutions that reduce water consumption.

The same goes for companies that have flipped park strips outside of their businesses to help reduce water consumption.

""We applaud what these large organizations are doing to help the state's water supply. Water conservation works best when everybody is doing their part across all sectors"" Ericksen's statement read. ""Collaboratively reducing our water usage is what we need to do to build drought resiliency. Any organization that reduces their water use helps Utah reach its regional conservation goals.""

Replicating the system

It may be a daunting task to create a standard system that uses less water for car wash companies like Mister though.

One of the issues that it faces is that has only designed a few dozen locations that it owns. Most of its 400 nationwide locations were acquired from previous companies which is a logical nightmare when it comes to replicating a system like the one in West Jordan. The buildings may not have the space for storage plumbing or a reclaim system so it requires a lot of creativity to make it happen.

""It's definitely a struggle"" Moncada says.

Yet company officials say they are now working to implement what they learned in Utah to other locations across the country.

Ultimately conserving water is in the best interest of car wash owners because as Moncada puts it you can't have a car wash without water. And since he oversees operations in other drought-stricken states he believes finding ways to conserve water matters deeply not only in being a good neighbor but also for business.

""(Sustaining water) is one of our top priorities right now"" he said. ""We are very well aware that if we want to sustain our position as responsible stewards we're going to have to create and find ways not just to keep doing what we're doing but even better.

""Hopefully we'll see (drought) turn around and we'll see water more as a resource"" Moncada adds. ""But the only way we're going to do that is if we each do our part in conserving as much as possible.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL21pbmluZy9tYWNhLWludmVzdG9ycy1oYXZlLXRvdWdoLWRlY2lzaW9uLW9uLXRoaWVzcy10YWtlb3Zlci0yMDIyMDgxMi1wNWI5YnrSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MACA investors wrangle with a tough decision on Thiess takeover,"MACA shareholders have a month to decide whether to accept a $350 million takeover bid from Thiess or risk becoming a minority investor in a company controlled by the mining contractor.

I love pro wrestling specifically the WWE. I have been a fan of wrestling since I was about 5 years old. It was the thing that connected me to my older brothers and it was my outlet that I used when I was sad or upset.

Now as a college student who has social media I am aware of everything. The WWE is in trouble specifically the owner and now former chairman of the WWE Vince McMahon.

He is being investigated for alleged sexual misconduct and harassment toward several women and additional allegations that he used company funds to keep them silent.

This event has made me wonder if I can support the company who has a bad history for its treatment of women.

It makes me question if I should even be a fan of this thing that I’ve loved since I was just a kid.

Well that’s the situation I’m in along with millions of other WWE fans around the world as WWE television ratings are at an all time low with struggling attendance and a rising new foe on the horizon.

As a kid you never really notice the bad things around you unless they are blatantly obvious you tend to be on the more optimistic side. I loved wrestling for the characters the cool music the amazing atmosphere and the video games.

I just thought the WWE was the coolest thing in the whole world. I mean where else would you see characters like a deadman a heartbreak kid a beer drinkin’ S-O-B and a guy who actually believes he’s a superhero.

I never realized the rampant drug problems the concussions the unsafe work environment and the fact that wrestlers die so young.

All I saw was the pizazz and none of the actual hardships behind the scenes I mean what kid would know all of that? We were too busy caring about how John Cena was the World Champion and how he was gonna take down the bad guys and not how a wrestler for the WWE around that time killed his wife his son and then himself.

I saw these wrestlers as just these cool characters on TV the awesome action figures in my room and the buff people I’d choose in my video games. I never saw them as people who were never home and constantly in pain.

As I got older and I realized wrestling was all predetermined yes it took me a while to understand that. When I realized that my perspective on wrestling changed.

It started to become hard for me to watch the shows or even go to the live events with my dad because I knew every single one of those wrestlers was in pain and frustrated in some way.

Whether that be their position in the company their beef with other wrestlers problems at home or even problems with themselves.

I began to grow up and once I started to go through my own hardships I began to relate to these so called “super heroes.”

I stopped watching wrestling for a couple years I just couldn’t get myself to do it anymore. I felt that I was almost guilty for watching and supporting the situations that would allow these hardships to keep happening.

That begs the question is it wrong to support something that has captivated and made fans around the world but is built on the backs of those who have died young not making enough to support themselves and deal with issues in their personal life stemming from the WWE.

Now it’s time to talk about the man who monopolized the wrestling industry and has recently been dealing with the scandals that have rocked his company and eventually caused his unprecedented retirement Vince McMahon.

Now McMahon has a very complicated legacy as he has changed wrestling forever by buying the company back in 1982 and from that moment on he went on a quest to acquire talent across the country and kill all his rival’s companies–which he did–and make wrestling mainstream. From 1982 to 2022 McMahon had a stranglehold on the wrestling business.

With that much power he was able to create stars for the world to love. He made Hulk Hogan a worldwide icon in the ‘80s he made wrestling edgy and cool with Stone Cold Steve Austin in the ‘90s while showing his ruthless aggression in the 2000’s and making The Rock and John Cena movie stars.

While he gave kids like myself an outlet and heroes to root for and aspire to be he had ruined the lives of so many and many blame him for wrestlers dying so young. He was investigated by the government for distributing steroids to his wrestlers and while he was acquitted it is a known fact that many wrestlers under his company were indeed using steroids.

Now he is being investigated for misconduct and using his company’s funds to silence these victims which should never be tolerated. Whatever punishment comes McMahon’s way is what he deserves.

Seven years ago I decided to see how the WWE was doing and eventually was pulled back in and now I am once again a fan but seeing these allegations made me revisit all these thoughts once again.

Is it wrong to support and watch the WWE despite everything they have done? Now of course the company has evolved and many would say that the company is doing the best protecting their wrestlers and now women wrestlers are being respected and pushed as stars rather than eye candy.

However it doesn’t change the fact that it took this long for change to happen. It took several key things to happen within the last 20 years to cause change. There are three specific moments that made the WWE what it is today.

The first one would be in 2005 when beloved wrestling legend Eddie Guerrero died of a heart attack at age 38 the night before he was supposed to wrestle. His death was so sudden and heartbreaking because Guerrero had dealt with major substance abuse and had been sober for the last few years of his life but the damage was too much. The WWE in response had instituted a wellness program that was designed to help and protect the wrestlers and while it may be flawed it definitely has saved many wrestlers lives.

The second key point would be Chris Benoit’s double murder suicide in 2007. Benoit was still wrestling for the WWE and was considered one of if not the best wrestler of his generation. When Benoit killed his family many attributed that to his repeated and untreated concussions and substance issues that he had from working with the WWE. In response WWE outlawed unprotected chair shots to the head and went from being TV-14 to now being PG.

The last key moment to change the WWE would be the Divas Revolution. Before 2015 the WWE treated women as eye candy and would be encouraged to show their “puppies” and be servants to the male wrestlers. Now of course there are many that did not follow this mold such as Trish Stratus Lita Mickie James Beth Phoenix and Gail Kim. Still they were the outliers and many women in the company are still reduced to this role.

In 2015 a blink-and-you-miss-it match that only lasted 29 seconds just happened to be the only women’s wrestling match on WWE’s three hour TV show. Many were outraged at this and demanded change which in return made McMahon respond that things will change. Since that response women’s wrestling has grown tremendously from side piece to main event. The WWE has now had two main events featuring only women for their biggest show Wrestlemania. The women in the company have more respect than ever but it took a long time to get there.

I am still a fan of wrestling and the WWE it’s hard to get rid of that love you have for something that really helped you when you were a kid.

As long as you acknowledge the issues something has and actively try to push against it and hope your voice does something to cause change then I would say you are doing the right thing.

The WWE is now under new management McMahon has retired fleeing from the sunken ship that was his legacy he is now replaced by his daughter and son-in-law. How things will be different under their management only time will tell.

I will always love the WWE and wrestling as a whole but I wilnever forget all the travesties the company has committed against people and you shouldn’t either.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBva2VybmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4L21zcHQtdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy1wb2tlci1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtNDE4NDcuaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSPT United States Poker Championship in San Diego Set for Sept. 15-25,"MSPT United States Poker Championship in San Diego Set for Sept. 15-25

Original art by Moira Villiard

Dominique Diaddigo-Cash



Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter III introduced a measure to establish a Climate Justice Advisory Board in 2020 to work toward carbon neutrality for the city and its residents.

This board was created to advise in the design of policies that intersect with the Saint Paul Climate Action and Resilience Plan (CARP). The goal of CARP is to achieve carbon neutrality for city operations by 2030 and citywide by 2050.

The inaugural members of the board include representatives from environmental organizations private corporations and community organizers to represent a broad spectrum of perspectives. I was selected to join the board for a three year term joining 16 others from across the east metro.

We spent much of our first year becoming grounded in the content of CARP. CARP talks about the vulnerabilities of Saint Paul to the impacts of ongoing climate change and takes initial steps to identify any disparities in vulnerability. For instance those under the age of five or over the age of 65 face increased vulnerability to incidents such as extreme weather illness or air pollution. Similarly in households where the dominant language is not English there is additional care needed to ensure outreach education and safety materials are accessible to all residents.

During this time two opportunities to engage in dialogue with the City Council around broader justice issues emerged.

The first was following the Minneapolis police murder of Daunte Wright after which Minneapolis and Saint Paul issued respective curfews. These curfews intended to discourage protest had a negative impact on frontline workers and people who relied on transit. The Saint Paul Criminal Justice Advisory Board (CJAB) joined in with other organizations such as the NAACP Black Lives Matter and the Saint Paul Federation of Educators in calling on Mayor Carter to lift the curfew to provide relief.

The second opportunity was a statement about Enbridge Line 3 and the water crossing permits issued in 2020. The CJAB acknowledged that our work needs to transcend geographical boundaries to fully understand climatic impacts. Following the lead of Saint Paul 350 the CJAB submitted a memo of support to calls to revoke the permits. This resulted in a meeting between the board and the Ramsey County attorney who expressed sympathy with our activism and reaffirmed our important role as it relates to policies within CARP.

These activities were beyond the traditional scope of our responsibilities as an advisory but nonetheless they have created meaningful opportunities to build relationships and grow into our purpose. This helps to expand the overall mission of climate justice and to understand the ways that we are all linked together.

The board meetings have also been a place to learn about community initiatives that we could help shape and participate in. These have included Xcel Energy discussing their 15-year Integrated Resource Plan the Electric Vehicle Spot Network and the Saint Paul Youth Commission. Every opportunity has been generative whether in the form of providing direct feedback for the implementation of an initiative or through the simple act of building community across sectors and between neighborhoods.

For Saint Paul and Ramsey County to achieve their climate goals changes in our infrastructure will need to be developed with an imperative for resilience and agencies will need to ensure that this takes priority over profitable development agreements. It’s the role of public advisories to ensure that this planning doesn’t happen at the expense of working class communities or communities of color. The CJAB’s focus on climate justice as opposed to simply climate change adaptation is a step toward ensuring that happens.

Going beyond CARP the board will need to engage directly with residents of Saint Paul to deepen our understanding of their experiences and to learn about new and emergent issues. The board reports directly to the city council and mayor’s office.

Moving forward the board has identified a list of priorities where our advisory is most urgent. These priorities are:

Transportation Energy burden Green workforce development and inclusion Emergency preparedness Communication/education within the community.

In April 2022 members of the board presented a summary of our first year to the Saint Paul City Council–the first face to face meeting for many of us.

Building resilience to climate change and working to hold back the tide of environmental ruin and corporate greed will happen through instituting sensible policies and lasting regulations.

This means understanding that the impacts of climate change more severely impact communities of color people living in poverty developing nations and people living in poverty.

Through building relationships with those who are most impacted institutions and agencies can help to amplify the voices of those whose lived experiences convey the urgency of the work.

The story of the work of the Climate Justice Advisory Board highlights much of what it means to be a community organizer focused on climate justice. You can follow this work by visiting the Board’s page on the St. Paul City website.

What impact will the climate-sceptic coal enthusiast President Trump have on the prospects for renewable energy? How will Brexit affect the UK’s renewable sector? And what’s driving the growth of clean energy in Asia? These were key questions for participants at a Guardian roundtable on the future of wind and solar power supported by Julius Baer.

And the answer to the Trump question? Precious little impact at all. The sheer strength of the renewables sector – driven by plummeting costs and a growing appetite among consumers and business alike – means it will continue to thrive despite the new administration’s doubts. That was the near-unanimous view of the participants. And it might even win over the president himself as his business brain engages with the potential of clean energy on the one hand and coal’s lack of it on the other.

Gina V Hall investment director at The Carbon Trust predicted that “a lot of the talk about bringing back coal jobs will start to fade. The rhetoric will be put aside in the face of the facts.” And the most persuasive fact of all is market logic. With renewables approaching grid parity (costing the same as electricity bought from the mains supply) their momentum is becoming unstoppable.

Many of America’s most powerful companies such as Apple and Google are strongly committed to clean energy said Hall “and they’re not going to let the government get in the way of what they want to do.”

Several participants at the roundtable pointed to the fact that clean energy enjoys strong bipartisan support. As Laura Cozzi from the International Energy Agency commented over half of the renewable capacity installed recently is in Republican-governed states. Such support might even help secure the future of the tax credits that presently help underpin new investments in the sector said Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath of E.ON Climate and Renewables.

“The word ‘renewable’ doesn’t feature in Trump’s America First plan – but it is full of talk of exploiting the country’s natural resources delivering low-cost energy and creating jobs. Well wind and solar can do all that.” And they have the potential to do a lot more particularly in the rustbelt areas Trump is committed to helping.

The jobs argument is particularly powerful given that more US citizens are employed in solar power than in generating electricity through coal oil and natural gas combined. As Clark MacFarlane CEO of Siemens Wind Power UK put it: “Trump’s core policy is more jobs. So why do anything to destroy American jobs especially ones delivering low-cost energy?”

Investors in the US are wary of being caught on the wrong side of history said Martin Wright chair of the Renewable Energy Association. “A lot of them are starting to view fossil fuels like tobacco – as a pariah sector.” And they don’t want to be left with stranded assets stuck in coal as the market moves decisively away from it. By contrast the falling prices of solar and wind make it increasingly appealing. Environmental economist Paul Ekins of University College London summed it up: “The markets will trump Trump.”

[…]

Growth in China and India

The real growth story in wind and solar of course is happening not in Europe or the States but Asia with both China and India investing heavily. So what’s driving that?

It’s partly the same story of falling costs with China eyeing huge export markets – in solar in particular. But there’s also growing local demand driven by two things – energy access and health. “Public health concerns in China are changing energy policy fundamentally. There’s no going back now” said Helena Molin Valdés of the UN Environment Programme.

Anil Raj co-founder of Indian solar business OMC Power pointed out that air quality is front-page news there. “People worry about pollution in European cities but they are like sanatoriums compared to New Delhi. Politicians spend a lot of time there and they can’t help but see and feel it too and that’s why things are happening.”

But he added the need for energy access will always be the prime driver. “There are two narratives around energy. A developing-world narrative and a carbon-reduction one.” For the former energy access is king. “We have 350 million people living off grid in India. If we needed to burn coal [to connect them] we would do that.” So it is fortunate he continued that fossil fuels are not the solution: “The cheapest and fastest way of connecting [off-grid people] in India is via renewables.” Sarah Chapman CEO of Faro Energy said that’s increasingly true in Latin America too.

Energy storage next big thing

So is everything in the renewables garden rosy? Not for Ekins. “We’re not getting nearly enough investment to meet the Paris target [of keeping the global temperature rise to two degrees above pre-industrial levels].” Other panellists echoed his concerns.

So how can the process be sped up? “We need to design the power markets of the future to favour renewables” said Cozzi. That will become all the more important as technologies such as smart grids and improved battery storage come into play. Wright argued for simplification moving away from incentives based around specific technologies to a system in which if you’re producing renewables – or enabling storage of renewable power – you get paid for it regardless of technology.

And he added the government shouldn’t be shy of setting some tough rules to drive progress: “Look at the buildings industry. If you hadn’t had some tough regulation there you wouldn’t have indoor toilets or double glazing.” Householders need incentives to do the right thing he argued: “So why not link stamp duty to SAP [energy-efficiency] ratings?”

All panellists agreed that the sheer speed of technological change would continue to disrupt the energy market – and in the long term at least renewables should be the clear winner. As battery technologies improve so wind and solar will become even more appealing overcoming the intermittent nature of such power sources (the wind doesn’t always blow the sun doesn’t always shine) by storing the electricity they produce for when it’s needed. “Storage will give us the next generation of energy billionaires” predicted Ekins.

Put all that together and the logic of renewables becomes irresistible said Wright. “It’s not a case of doing it to save the planet any more. People are seeing this as a business opportunity. It’s as simple as that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMTMvamFtZXMtYS1zdG9scGVzdGFkLWRvd250b3duLXN0LXBhdWwtYnVpbGRpbmctYm9vbS1vZi0xOTgwLTIwMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James A.

To read the full briefing see 13-step recruitment plan; How to prevent a ‘great resignation’ and add the Leadership Briefing to your subscriptions.

Several variables are driving the current police recruitment crisis. Some of the issues such as the economy and media criticism of the police are beyond our control. Still there are strategies police leaders can implement to increase the number of candidates applying to join departments.

Dedicate resources and develop a recruitment & retention plan

Regardless of the size of the department agency leaders must devise a strategic plan that addresses short- and long-term police staffing needs. The plan should assess budgetary requirements for recruitment as well as assess appropriate numbers to adequately staff the agency. The plan should predict attrition based on situational awareness of contemporary issues and not just rely on historical data trends.

The recruiting manager should have dedicated personnel chosen as the best representatives of the department. Recruiters should be trained to be mentors and able to answer any possible question from candidates. Recruiters should be proactive and personable to engage and encourage candidates. Agencies should analyze their regions to determine the best methods to seek candidates such as via social media or print media and the best locations such as local colleges and universities as well as locations unique to the area (churches beaches gyms road rallies street fairs sporting events community gatherings military discharge facilities etc.).

Speed up the recruitment process

Today’s candidate pool wants immediate gratification. The idea of applying for a job that may take up to 12 months or longer to secure is unfathomable for many. The antiquated system of having applicants fill out applications and then follow a testing period for written tests oral boards physical agility and medical screening drug testing backgrounds polygraph and psychological testing is unappealing to today’s candidates.

Technology can shorten the police recruit application process. The testing segments mentioned above can be standardized and processed concurrently rather than consecutively. Platforms like interviewnow.io can bring recruiters and candidates together via remote forums that would allow national rather than regional or local recruiting efforts.

Some agencies already speed up the process of candidate eligibility by asking for the candidate’s driver’s license a hair sample for drug analysis and a brief background biography. Medical waivers to review pre-existing medical conditions may be obtained at this point as well.

Regarding background investigations software-centric systems from companies such as Guardian Alliance Technologies and Miller Mendel can speed up the process significantly. The idea of having a cadre of file-carrying background investigators doing leg work and waiting for background packets to be returned via snail mail should be a thing of the past.

National testing process and database

As we await the release of President Biden’s $13 billion law enforcement recruiting plan we can only hope that the plan includes funding for innovation in recruitment. Some of the ideas that could reduce the time delays and backlogs include:

Implementation of a Law Enforcement National Candidate Database containing candidate profiles (age gender regional preferences etc.) accessible to any agency. Development of national virtual forums for candidates to learn about agencies testing requirements and expectations associated with the recruitment process. Creation of a national cost-free application process using a standard Pellet-B test Partnerships with private sector screening centers to pre-screen applicants. Cost-free pre-testing facilities for written oral and physical agility tests. Monthly testing to gather baseline levels of aptitude to allow applicants to improve scores. Physical testing at police academies public or private athletic gyms or dedicated state testing sites. Conducting other tests concurrently upon successful completion of written tests. Use of software-based background screening. Expedited tests using any of the accepted truth-telling practices available such as a polygraph EyeDetect Converus Conditional hiring budgets enable offers to be made within 30 days of the written test while other background tests proceed. Candidates would be required to sign injury waivers understanding that failure to pass the background check would result in their release. Once in the academy additional funding should be allocated for remedial training mentoring and retention plans for struggling recruits. Retention plans should include alternative functions within a department to employ non-graduates of the academy to other positions within the agency (non-sworn positions in administration security police-service aids traffic community relations etc.) rather than complete dismissal. This would be an incentive for those resistant to applying to a law enforcement agency at risk of losing their current employment.

Efforts must be made to address the police recruiting crisis as a national issue not as a local or even regional one. These 13 strategies are a step in that direction.

Next steps: Read national reports

In 2019 the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) released “The Workforce Crisis and What Police Agencies are Doing About It” which was followed that same year by an IACP report titled “A Crisis for Law Enforcement.”

Both reports describe similar challenges regarding evolving changes in law enforcement duties around responding to mental health crises homelessness and collateral social issues such as drug overdoses. The reports also detail issues with decades-old policies and procedures around recruiting and testing.

While neither report offers concrete solutions police executives can use the documents as a starting point to develop strategies specific to their agency’s needs.

Related reading:

The study is named “Feasibility of Fitness Tracker Usage to Assess Activity level and toxicities in patients with Colorectal Cancer”.

This study examines the correlation between mean ‘steps per day’ measured by the fitness trackers and toxicities due to postoperative complications in patients undergoing treatment.

And it found that toxicity was lower among patients who clocked at least five thousand steps per day.

The study concludes by suggesting that physical activity levels in users measured by steps per day using wearable trackers can serve as an adjunct to assessing patients’ overall health.

Furthermore it concludes that future studies incorporating Fitbit Charge can standardize patient assessment and help identify vulnerable populations.

Overall conclusion as stated by the study researchers was

“We found that using FC (Fitbit Charge) as a diagnostic tool was feasible and acceptable by patients with CRC. The level of activity correlated well with PS (Health Performance Status) and the baseline activity (steps per day) level was associated with toxicities (absolute incidence) but findings were not significant as this study was not designed to study it.”

It is no surprise that our activity levels correlate with our overall health status. This becomes particularly important for people who are recovering from surgery or those with cancer.

Companies such as Apple and Fitbit are therefore working with numerous health sciences companies to not only evaluate the use of wearables for symptom tracking using SpO2 monitoring resting heart rate and heart rate variability monitoring but also are working to develop solutions that will help with expedited recovery of patients who have undergone surgeries or other complex procedures.

Apple’s partnership with Zimmer Biomet is a leading example of this initiative. The mymobility platform developed on the Apple Watch via a collaborative effort between Apple and Zimmer Biomet is being used for patients undergoing orthopedic procedures.

Digital health and wellness monitoring are here to stay and only getting started.
