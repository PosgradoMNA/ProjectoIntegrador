Prince Charles was said to have been given a total of €3m (£2.6m) during meetings with Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani the former prime minister of Qatar.

The cash was handed to the heir to the British throne in a suitcase on one occasion a holdall on another as well as in Fortnum & Mason carrier bags the up-market department store which holds a royal warrant to supply the prince’s household with groceries.

The handovers are alleged to have occurred during meetings between the two men including a private one-to-one meeting at Clarence House in 2015 it was claimed.

In a statement a Clarence House spokesperson said the money given during the 2015 meeting was “passed immediately to one of the prince’s charities who carried out the appropriate covenants and assured us that all the correct processes were followed”.

The suitcase containing the cash was given to two of Charles’ advisers who are said to have hand-counted the money. Palace aides are said to have asked Coutts the private bank which acts for the royal family to collect the cash.

Each payment was deposited into the accounts of the Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund (PWCF). There is no suggestion the payments were illegal the Sunday Times reported today.

The sheikh one of the richest people in the world was dubbed the “man who bought London” after he used his wealth as well as his influence on the Qatari Wealth fund to make huge investments in London including the Shard Harrods and the InterContinental London Park Lane. He is the owner of one of the world’s richest football clubs Paris Saint-Germain.

There is no evidence the sheikh did not intend the monies to go to the charity and Hamad was unavailable for comment it was reported.

The chair of the trustees to the charity confirmed to the newspaper that the 2015 donation was made and then the trustees who have a legal duty to protect the charity’s reputation “discussed the governance and donor relationship (confirming that the donor was a legitimate and verified counterparty) and our auditors signed off on the donation after a specific enquiry during the audit. There was no failure of governance”.

The charity is said to have confirmed the 2015 donation was made in cash at the “donor’s choice”.

Charles and Hamad are said to have a relationship going back several decades. In 2010 Charles was said to have lobbied Hamad to shelve the £3bn redevelopment of London’s Chelsea Barracks – writing a letter in which he told the country’s then prime minister that the state-backed Qatari Diar’s proposed steel-and-glass design “made my heart sink”. Charles later met the emir of Qatar for tea at Clarence House where the topic was raised once again. Qatar subsequently pulled the plans prompting the Candy brothers who were overseeing the development to launch a £81m lawsuit. In it they accused Qatar of caving in to the prince’s demands.

The latest claims come at an embarrassing time for the prince. Clarence House has rebutted claims of a “cash-for-access” culture in his organisation with the Metropolitan police and the Charity Commission investigating fundraising practices including the sale of honours. It has been alleged that Charles’s closest confidant Michael Fawcett secured an honour for a Saudi billionaire.

Fawcett resigned from his position in Charles’s inner circle in March 2003 after a report by Sir Michael Peat identified mismanagement at Clarence House. The Peat inquiry found that Fawcett had accepted “numerous gifts in the course of his royal service” but cleared him of any financial impropriety. Fawcett continued to work for Charles on a freelance basis as a fixer and party planner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvZS5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9lcmxpbmctaGFhbGFuZC12aWV3cy1wYXVsLXBvZ2Jhcy0zbS1tYW5zaW9uLTM0NDEwNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Erling Haaland 'views' Paul Pogba's £3m Cheshire mansion,"Get them on Location Location Location

Erling Haaland has gone to visit Paul Pogba’s Cheshire mansion which is worth £3m as he prepares to move to England to start his new life at Manchester City.

Pogba is set to rejoin Juventus on a free transfer after leaving Manchester United at the end of the season and is therefore looking to move out his current property.

Haaland is house hunting ahead of his debut Premier League season

Ahead of his debut Premier League season Haaland is looking for somewhere to live and Pogba’s house was recently placed on the market to rent for £30000 a month. Bit expensive.

The house contains an array of features which include a heated swimming pool sauna gym and the infamous ‘Paul Pogba arena’ – an indoor football pitch which has LED lighting a scoreboard and of course the Frenchman’s initials carved into the centre circle.

Haaland and Pogba are under the same agencey

One source told The Sun: “Erling is keen to get settled down as quickly as possible so he can hit the ground running at City.

“He and Paul know each other and share the same management team.

“Given how Paul’s time at United has gone he’s unlikely to return to the UK so he will be looking to sell his house but he would be happy to rent it if necessary.

“Paul and Erling are quite similar characters. They like to enjoy themselves so it could really appeal to him.”

Haaland and his father Alfie also visited three other properties last week as they bid to get the 21-year-old settled ahead of his first pre-season under Pep Guardiola.

The Norwegian’s first game in the Premier League will be a trip to West Ham United on Sunday August 7.

THE €3million in cash stuffed into bags and handed to Prince Charles by a Qatari sheikh is to be investigated by the charity watchdog.

Three payments of €1million each — totalling more than £2.5million — were accepted by the heir to the throne during private meetings between 2011 and 2015.

The gifts from controversial Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani were reportedly bundled into a holdall a suitcase and Fortnum & Mason carrier bags.

Clarence House insists all ­correct processes were followed over the donations from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani known as HBJ.

However the Charity Commission may choose to interview fund trustees.

It can also freeze accounts if it discovers serious wrongdoing suspend or remove trustees or make referrals to the police.

It comes as another of Charles’s charities the Prince’s Foundation is being probed by police amid a cash-for-honours scandal.

HBJ once estimated to be worth more than £9.5billion is believed to have handed Charles the first €1million instalment in 2011 — stuffed in carrier bags from posh store Fortnum & Mason.

In 2015 the prince accepted a holdall containing a further €1million during a one-on-one private meeting at Clarence House with two aides counting the money.

A suitcase with another €1million was also personally handed to Charles on another occasion — with total donations coming to more than £2.5million.

The heir to the throne has met HBJ several times including during a 2013 Middle East tour while he was Qatar PM.

However the meetings where the money was given do not appear on the list of official engagements undertaken by working royals.

A Charity Commission spokeswoman said: “We are aware of reports about donations received by The Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund. We will review the information to determine whether there is any role for the commission in this matter.”

It's understood that the payments will be verified and fund trustees may be questioned before the commission's next steps are decided.

Charities are allowed to accept donations in cash but they must exercise due diligence to avoid money laundering and corruption.

Private bank Coutts is reported to have collected the money at the request of Palace aides and deposited it into the fund’s account.

Clarence House insisted all the proper procedures were followed and said some details in a report by the Sunday Times are disputed.

A spokesman said: “Charitable donations received from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim were passed immediately to one of the Prince’s charities who carried out the appropriate governance and have assured us that all the correct processes were followed.”

'DUE PROCESS'

Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said yesterday he was confident the donations would have gone through “proper due process”.

Mr Lewis told the BBC: “What I have seen is the Palace have been very clear that all monies go through proper due process the charities obviously go through proper due process.

“I’m confident having had some dealings with charities The Prince’s Trust The Prince’s Foundation around the Palace in the past myself that these will have gone through proper due process.”

Meanwhile another of Charles’s charities — the Prince’s Foundation — is at the centre of a police probe over a cash-for-honours scandal.

Michael Fawcett former chief executive of the foundation allegedly offered a Saudi businessman help securing a knighthood and British citizenship in return for donations.

Mr Fawcett previously one of Charles’s closest aides stepped down last year over a leaked letter to Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz.

He was one of the most prolific donors to the prince’s charities and even has a forest named after him — the Mahfouz Wood at the 15th-century Castle of Mey in Scotland formerly the Queen Mother’s home.

In a surprising report from the newspaper on Saturday evening it’s claimed United have put forward a £3m bid for the Malmo defender. The surprise comes in that many have expected United not to go spending money this summer with Paul Heckingbottom even admitting he was looking more at loans and frees.

However The Sun has claimed that the Blades are indeed in for Ahmedhodzic with Blackburn Rovers also keen. The Ewood Park outfit could have a minor advantage in that their new manager Jon Dahl Tomasson is Ahmedhodzic’s former coach.

United are on the lookout for a new defender this summer after becoming short on numbers there last term. And with Jayden Bogle ruled out until around October as well Heckingbottom will want someone in to help the backline.

While there has been an expectancy from some fans to not see any money spent United do have some cash and Stephen Bettis said the club would spend money this summer. Further players like Max Lowe and Oliver Burke could be sold while a number of players have left for nothing including David McGoldrick.

United have also been linked with a move to sign Derby’s Tom Lawrence.

Our View: Signs Of Ambition From United With Ahmedhodzic?

Well nobody expected this. A £3m bid for an international player in a position we desperately need to add players in.

MORE UNITED STORIES

If this is correct then you have to say fair play to the board here. Backing Heckingbottom with £3m for a new player is a good statement of intent from them.

Not much is known about Ahmedhodzic of course. He was previously on the books at Nottingham Forest and very nearly joined Chelsea in 2020 before some confusion over his agent put paid to that move. The defender has 18 cap for Bosnia too and spent last season on loan with French outfit Bordeaux.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy9yb3lhbC8xNjMxNDEwL1FhdGFyaS1zaGVpa2gtcHJpbmNlLUNoYXJsZXMtcm95YWwtZmFtaWx5LW1vbmFyY2gtZm9ydG51bS1hbmQtTWFzb24tZG9uYXRpb27SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvcm95YWwvMTYzMTQxMC9RYXRhcmktc2hlaWtoLXByaW5jZS1DaGFybGVzLXJveWFsLWZhbWlseS1tb25hcmNoLWZvcnRudW0tYW5kLU1hc29uLWRvbmF0aW9uL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qatari Sheik gifts £3m to Prince Charles in a suitcase and Fortnum & Mason carrier bags,"Charles Admitted receiving nearly £3million in cash donations from a Qatari Sheikh

The heir to the throne who has insisted he did nothing wrong was given the cash in three bundles of £1million each including one stash of notes said to have been handed over in a suitcase by Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani a businessmen with a £2billion fortune who served as Qatar’s prime minister between 2007 and 2013.

Clarence House has been unable to explain why the donations worth around £860000 each were made in cash between 2011 and 2015 and what Sheikh Hamad hoped to gain from making them. But it has insisted they were “passed immediately” to one of Charles’s charities the Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund (PWCF) and that it carried out due diligence. Although there is no suggestion the payments were illegal critics said Charles whose charitable foundation The Prince’s Foundation is currently facing a police investigation into allegations that it fixed an honour for a Saudi billionaire in return for donations risked undermining trust in the monarchy. He was also accused of risking destroying his mother the Queen’s legacy over claims he operates a cash-for-access policy when dealing with wealthy donors to his charities. His biographer Tom Bower said: “I think his problem is however legal that was it looks terrible and I think more will come out. Clearly there is a disgruntled source who saw what was happening with regard to donations and he has a real problem. Who accepts large bags of cash like that?"" “It’s never been a problem for the Queen because she doesn’t do it but Charles for the last 30 to 40 years has been running this charity business. Even his father Prince Philip warned him that his cash-for-access was going to cause trouble.” Sir Alastair Graham the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life said the revelations that such large sums were handed over in cash were “truly shocking”. “I wouldn’t make a distinction between a politician and member of the Royal Family” he told The Sunday Times which broke the story. “If the Qatari government wants to make a gift to his foundation then there are proper ways to do these things rather than handling large sums of cash.”

But a Government minister Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis came out in support of the Prince and said he was confident that the donations would bave been handled properly. “This isn’t a Government issue but what I have seen is the palace have been very clear that all monies go through proper due process the charities obviously go through proper due process” he told the BBC."" “I’m confident having had some dealings with charities The Prince’s Trust The Prince’s Foundation around the palace in the past myself that these will have gone through proper due process.” Charles is understood to have got lawyers involved over some of the allegations. It is understood he and his advisers dispute claims that Sheikh Hamad 62 - known by the initials HBJ - gave one tranche of a million euros to the Prince in carrier bags from Fortnum & Mason the luxury department store with royal warrants from the Queen and Charles. They are also understood to have no recollection of the newspaper’s claim that two advisers hand-counted money alleged to have been given in €500 notes - a denomination once nicknamed the “bin Laden” because of its links to terrorist financing. The newspaper quoted one of Charles’s former advisers saying: “Everyone felt very uncomfortable about the situation.” It is accepted however that the donations were made in cash handed to the charity fund and paid into a bank account at Coutts which also insisted it did all the necessary checks. In a statement Clarence House said: “Charitable donations received from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim were passed immediately to one of the Prince’s charities who carried out the appropriate governance and have assured us that all the correct processes were followed.”

Bundles of cash were handed over to Charles in a suitcase and Fortnum & Mason carrier bags

The Charity Commission which oversees UK voluntary organisations has no ban on charities accepting cash donations. But it warns in its guidelines: “Charities should be wary of receiving large or unexpected donations of cash other than through their own or publicly organised fundraising activities and should take additional steps to assure themselves of the provenance of those funds.” Staff at the PWCF are understood to have believed that there were no major concerns over Sheikh Hamad because of his standing as a prime minister and did not believe that receiving a cheque for the same sums would have made much difference. The PWCF founded in 1979 with a mission to transform lives and build sustainable communities awards grants to UK registered non-profit organisations to deliver projects in the UK the Commonwealth and overseas. Charles and Sheikh Hamad was his country’s foreign minister from 1992 and continued in that role while prime minister until resigning from both jobs when a new Emir took over in 2013 have enjoyed a long association stretching back decades. The Sheikh who controlled his country’s $250 billion sovereign wealth fund when he was prime minister and oversaw investments in Harrods the Shard and many other businesses in Britain has built close ties with the Royal Family. Charles 73 wrote to him in 2010 and successfully lobbied HBJ to stop the £3 billion redevelopment of Chelsea Barracks in London because the proposed steel-and-glass design by state-backed Qatari Diar “made my heart sink”. Instead an alternative design by an architect of Charles’s choosing was picked. Sheikh Hamad has also been embroiled in controversy. He and Charles were both named in the leaked Paradise Papers detailing how politicians royalty and other prominent people had investments in offshore tax-havens.

In 2015 HBJ invoked diplomatic immunity in a UK torture case in which Qatari agents acting on his behalf were alleged to have falsely imprisoned British national Fawaz al-Attiya in Doha. In 2017 the Sheikh admitted that Qatar under his leadership might have inadvertently funded the Syrian terror group Al Nusra an offshoot of Al Qaeda. “Look in Syria everybody did mistakes including your country"" he told American journalist Charlie Rose. Graham Smith chief executive of anti-monarchy group Republic said Charles needed to make a full disclosure about the payments. “Sheikh Hamad faces serious accusations over human rights and has significant financial and other interests here in the UK” Mr Smith said. “Given that Prince Charles has direct access to the British prime minister and all government ministers as well as all cabinet papers this raises serious ethical questions about what the Sheikh expected in return” “Was he able to use Charles as a channel for influencing the UK government or to gain inside knowledge of government business?"" “This also adds to the serious questions about Prince Charles’s judgement following from other accusations of cash-for-access and cash-for-honours.”

Comment by Richard Palmer a Royal Correspondent There may be nothing sinister about Prince Charles accepting £2.58 million in cash bundles from a wealthy donor but it is not a good look. The latest revelations about the heir to the throne’s fundraising prompts the question of whether there should be a register of interests for royals in the same way that MPs are required to detail any financial interests or benefits they receive in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests. Charles 73 is one of Britain’s greatest philanthropists and has contributed much to national life through charities such as The Prince’s Trust and his efforts to highlight the dangers our planet faces from climate change and other environmental crises. But as wealthy as he is he does not have the money to do it all on his own and like other members of his family part of his role is to cajole others into supporting charity initiatives that help the disadvantaged and dispossessed in our society."

Abbott initiated a recall of its infant formula products and closed its Michigan plant in mid-February after reports of serious bacterial infections in four infants. The recall and closure worsened an infant formula shortage that began with pandemic supply chain issues. Abbott produces Similac and other popular brands of infant formulas.

The date of death and state of death of the fifth infant was not announced. The FDA apparently became aware of the death on June 10 2020. So far the FDA has received 129 complaints linked to Abbott formula products including 119 since the product recall in February.

According to the FDA this would bring the total to five illnesses with three deaths.

Total Adverse Events: 5

Hospitalizations: 5

Reported Deaths: 3

Illness Onset Date Range: 9/6/2021 – 1/4/2022 – new case not yet reported

States with Adverse Events: MN (1) OH (2) TX (1) – new case not yet reported

Product Distribution: Nationwide and International

The production facility reopened earlier this month but recently had to shut down again because of flooding.

The U.S. Attorney sued Abbott and several employees. In the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the FDA the government alleges that powdered infant formula products manufactured at Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis facility were adulterated because they were made under unsanitary conditions and in violation of current good manufacturing practice requirements.

Abbott essentially confessed to the violations in the below consent decree. Under the consent decree Abbott Nutrition will be required to retain an independent expert to review the Sturgis facility’s operations to ensure compliance with the law. It also includes requirements for testing products as well as ceasing production and promptly notifying the FDA should contamination be detected. The consent decree also requires the implementation of a sanitation plan environmental monitoring plan and employee training programs.

These trials aimed to evaluate novel combination therapies using CD20-antibodies such as obinutuzumab (GA101) and targeted drugs such as ibrutinib with a limited duration of treatment in an all comer population irrespective of firstline (1 L) versus relapse/refractory (RR) therapy comorbidities and genetic features. Patients with a higher tumor load received two courses of bendamustine as debulking before six cycles of induction therapy (IT) with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib were administered. Patients responding to IT continued with maintenance therapy (MT) consisting of daily ibrutinib and obinutuzumab every three months until achievement of an undetectable MRD (uMRD) remission by flow cytometry (10^−4) confirmed by two consecutive uMRD results in the peripheral blood (PB) within three months progression start of new therapy or for up to 24 months whichever occurred first.

The primary endpoint analysis with an overall response rate of 100% including 47.5% patients with uMRD in PB at the end of IT has been reported previously [3]. Here we present the final analysis with extended follow-up including the maintenance phase and data on treatment discontinuation triggered by MRD assessment in PB.

61 patients (30 1 L (49.2%) 31 RR (50.8%)) constituted the full analysis set that was defined as all enrolled patients who received at least two complete cycles of IT and used for efficacy analyses according to the study protocol. Safety analyses included all 66 recruited patients who received at least one dose of any compound of the study treatment. Patient demographics are shown in Table 1. After a median observation time of 38.1 months (range 5.4–44.8; 1 L 38.5 RR 37.2) 49 patients (80.3%; 28 1 L 21 RR) completed the trial as planned. As one RR patient died during IT and another RR patient underwent adverse events (AE) that prohibited further study treatment 59 of 61 patients (96.7%; 30 1 L 29 RR) started MT. A median of three maintenance cycles were administered (range 1–8).

Table 1 Patient Demographic and Baseline Clinical Characteristics. Full size table

15 patients (25.4%; 6 1 L 9 RR) completed 24 months of MT. 11 patients discontinued early: 6 due to AE (10.2%; 2 1 L 4 RR) 2 each (3.4%) due to PD (2 RR) or refusal of further treatment (2 1 L) and 1 RR due to physician´s decision (1.7%).

33 patients (55.9%; 20 1 L 13 RR) terminated MT due to uMRD in PB after a median time on MT of 6.0 months (range 3.0–23.3; 1 L: 6.2 months RR: 5.7 months).

During MT response was improved in 16 of 59 patients (27.1%) with 6 patients (10.2%) achieving a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete recovery of the bone marrow (BM) as best response [4]. 53 patients (89.8%) achieved a partial remission including 32 patients (54.2%) with a clinical CR defined as absence of disease by clinical examination and blood count but without computed tomography assessment or BM biopsy. 42 of 59 patients (23 1 L 19 RR) had uMRD in PB at the last staging during MT resulting in an uMRD rate of 71.2% (1 L 76.7% RR 65.5%). 56.3% of patients without and 76.7% of patients with prior debulking therapy reached uMRD at the last staging during MT.

The median duration of response (DOR) was 38.0 months and the 2-year DOR rate 88.3% (1 L 100.0% RR 77.4%). The median time to uMRD from the date of enrolment to the date of first uMRD was 10.9 months (1 L 10.2 months RR 10.9 months) as the first measurement took place after 8 months. The median event free survival (EFS) was 44.8 months with a 3-year EFS rate of 70.9% (1 L 81.8% RR 60.7%) the median treatment free survival and median time to next treatment were not reached with a 3-year rate of 76.1% (1 L 89.0% RR 64.0%) and 83.2% (1 L 89.0% 77.2%) respectively. However 9 patients (14.8%) received further treatment after the end of the trial (3 1 L (10.0%) 6 RR (19.4%)). Subsequent therapies consisted of chemoimmunotherapy or venetoclax plus obinutuzumab. Five patients (2 1 L 3 RR) received subsequent therapies with ibrutinib.

The estimated median progression free survival (PFS) was 44.8 months with 77.9% (1 L 89.1% RR 67.3%) being event-free at 3 years (HR 0.230 95% CI 0.064–0.828; Fig. 1a). Seven of 17 patients without (41.2%) and 8 of 44 patients with prior debulking (18.2%) progressed or died. At 3-years 57.8% of patients without and 85.7% of patients with debulking were still event-free (HR 0.251 CI 0.084–0.751) In 13 patients with TP53 aberrations (i.e. TP53 mutation and/or 17p deletion) 3 (23.1% 0 1 L 3 RR) and in 48 patients without genetic TP53 aberrations 12 events occurred (25%). The PFS rate at 2 years was 76.9% for patients with TP53 aberrations versus 95.8% for patients without (HR 1.076 95% CI 0.3–3.86).

In a landmark analysis from last treatment exposure during MT the median PFS was not reached in patients who stopped MT due to uMRD with a 2-year PFS rate of 82.9%. Five patients with TP53 aberrations discontinued MT due to uMRD with one progression occuring after 6.2 months after treatment discontinuation. 8 patients with TP53 aberrations discontinued MT for other reasons than uMRD with two progressions (25.0%).

In another extended PFS landmark analysis of patients with unmutated IGHV status who discontinued MT for other reasons only one progression occurred in 10 patients (10.0%) with prior debulking versus 3 progressions in 8 patients (37.5%) without debulking (HR 0.039 CI 0.003–0.553).

Seven patients died (11.5%) with no deaths occurring in 1 L patients. Causes of deaths included two events of sepsis and one event of pulmonary sepsis duodenitis pneumonia and cerebrovascular accident each. One patient died due to PD. No grade 5 AE occurred during MT. Two patients with TP53 aberrations and very high CLL-IPI died after discontinuation of MT for other reasons than uMRD; one due to AE one due to PD. One fatality occurred after treatment discontinuation due to uMRD. Overall survival is shown in Fig. 1b.

During MT 332 CTC grades 1–4 AE were documented. Adjustment of study drugs was performed due to 79 (23.8%) events whereas AE related dose modifications of ibrutinib occurred in 26 patients (44.1%; 15 1 L (50.0%) 11 RR (37.9%)). Most events (85 (25.6%)) were infections or infestations followed by skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (32 (9.6%)) and gastrointestinal disorders (30 (9.0%)). Most common observed grade 3–4 toxicities during MT were neutropenia (in 11.9% of patients; 1 L 13.3% RR 10.3%) basal cell carcinoma (in 6.8% of patients; 1 L 13.3% RR 0) thrombocytopenia (in 5.1% of patients; 1 L 3.3% RR 6.9%) and pneumonia (in 5.1% of patients; 1 L 6.7% RR 3.4%). All infections were CTC grade 3 at maximum including one case of fungal pneumonia (CTC grade 3).

17 cases of cardiac disorders were documented among them 6 cases of atrial fibrillation. 13 bleeding events occurred in 11 of 59 (18.6%) patients.

In conclusion the CLL2-BIG study demonstrated that sequential therapy with bendamustine ibrutinib and obinutuzumab showed a very promising efficacy and good safety profile. With the addition of obinutuzmab no additional toxicity occurred when compared to ibrutinib monotherapy [5] and no increase of bleeding or cardiac events was observed.

By continuation of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab during MT the depth of response could be improved as previously shown for treatment with ibrutinib [5 6]. Notably 71.2% of the patients had uMRD in PB at the last staging during MT which is comparable with uMRD rates after venetoclax containing combination regimens [7 8].

However even with a longer follow-up this trial will not answer the question whether a fixed-duration treatment is superior to a long-term therapy due to the lack of a randomized direct comparison. This will be addressed in future trials e.g. the CLL17 trial (registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT04608318).

Nevertheless even though treatment could be discontinued early a 3-year PFS rate of 77.9% for the BIG regimen seems comparable with first line treatment with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib as long-term therapy in the ILLUMINATE trial with an estimated 30-month PFS of 79% [9].

Though our results show that an MRD-guided treatment discontinuation of ibrutinib is promising and feasible for different CLL patient groups including those with unfavorable risk factors. However it remains to be determined which patients of this heterogeneous study population may have benefited the most.

Prior debulking therapy might be beneficial possibly due to rapid achievement of uMRD broad selective pressure or prevention of clonal sweeps caused by prior application of chemotherapy. Whether this is really playing a significant role in overcoming adverse outcomes especially in patients with unmutated IGHV status or TP53 aberrations needs further evaluation.

Therefore pooled analyses across the BXX trials will be performed. Additionally a second generation of BXX trials is currently conducted.

Ultimately these conceptual trials will allow to design more personalized approaches for future CLL therapies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlcm1hdG9sb2d5dGltZXMuY29tL3ZpZXcvZWZmZWN0aXZlbHktdHJlYXRpbmctaGlkcmFkZW5pdGlzLXN1cHB1cmF0aXZh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Effectively Treating Hidradenitis Suppurativa,"Theodore Rosen MD professor of dermatology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston Texas discussed how to effectively treat hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) last week at the Society for Dermatology Physician Assistants Annual Summer Meeting in Austin Texas. Rosen is also speaking today at the Maui Derm NP+PA Summer 2022 meeting in Colorado Springs Colorado from June 22-25.1

Rosen started off by stating that while adalimumab (Humira; AbbVie) is approved to treat HS he finds that it only helps sometimes. “I have better luck when I can get it or I can get some samples or I save up some samples of secukinumab (Cosentyx; Novartis). To my experience [secukinumab] works better than adalimumab” he said.

However bimekizumab (UCB Biopharma) and interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F inhibitor is on its way to a potential approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and could be beneficial for treating HS. It was supposed to be approved for psoriasis already says Rosen but was delayed because of a manufacturing issue not because of an issue with the safety and efficacy of the medication. Also ustekinumab (Stelara; Janssen) has been shown to help in HS treatment but only for short-term use which can help with the initial hump.

“I give almost everybody who shows up with HS an antibiotic to start with. But remember this is not an infection. This is not something you want to treat with an antibiotic every single day. I don’t care which antibiotic; it’s not the long-term treatment” said Rosen.

He noted that finasteride has been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of HS in about 70% of men but does not work well for women.

Additionally if the patient is a smoker Rosen urged clinicians to tell their patient to stop smoking as smoking can exacerbate the disease. “Remember is this called ‘smokers boils’ in Europe. Smoking absolutely makes [HS] worse” he said.

Another treatment mentioned was the use of skin-tightening lasers such as the Sciton because the heat from the lasers helps relieve symptoms of HS according to Rosen. Specifically he goes over the affected area multiple times until the area is warm and he performs this treatment about once per month.

Rosen concluded by recommending intralesional injections of corticosteroids which have been shown to help with the treatment of HS and most patients receive immediate benefit from it; however he said this is not a long-term treatment.

Adobe (ADBE -0.85%) and Autodesk (ADSK -0.31%) provide essential software for designers and other media professionals. Both companies also locked their users into sticky subscriptions by converting their desktop software into cloud-based services over the past decade.

That transformation turned Adobe and Autodesk into two of the market's most resilient software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks. Over the past 10 years Adobe's stock rallied nearly 1100% while Autodesk's shares advanced more than 440%. The Nasdaq only rose about 290% during the same period.

Should investors buy either of these stocks today as rising interest rates drive investment away from the tech sector? Let's look at their differences growth rates and valuations to decide.

The differences between Adobe and Autodesk

Adobe generates over 70% of its revenue from its Digital Media business which houses its Creative Cloud (Photoshop Illustrator Premiere Pro and other creativity software) and Document Cloud (Acrobat and Sign) services. The rest of its revenue comes from its Digital Experience business which provides enterprise-oriented marketing analytics and workflow services.

Autodesk generates nearly three-quarters of its revenue from its flagship AutoCAD drafting software and additional architecture engineering and construction (AEC) services. The remainder of its revenue comes from its manufacturing and media and entertainment (M&E) software.

Which company is growing faster?

Adobe grew at a faster clip than Autodesk over the past five years. Between fiscal 2016 and 2021 (which ended last December) Adobe's annual revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22%. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 33%.

Between fiscal 2017 and 2022 (which ended this January) Autodesk's annual revenue grew at a CAGR of 17%. After several years of losses Autodesk turned consistently profitable again in fiscal 2020 and its adjusted EPS rose 45% in fiscal 2021 and 25% in 2022.

Adobe and Autodesk both generated stable growth throughout the pandemic because they firmly locked in their customers with annual subscriptions. Both companies also stopped doing business in Russia earlier this year.

Adobe faces a tougher slowdown than Autodesk

Neither of these software companies is completely immune to a recession but the media sector -- which drives most of Adobe's growth -- is arguably more exposed to macroeconomic headwinds than Autodesk's more-diverse mix of design engineering and manufacturing customers.

That's why Adobe is bracing for a tougher slowdown than Autodesk this year. Adobe saw revenue rise 23% in fiscal 2021 but it expects only 12% growth this year as it grapples with ""summer seasonality"" higher taxes unfavorable exchange rates and its loss of sales in Russia and Belarus. It recently raised its Creative Cloud prices to offset some of that pressure but it still expects its adjusted EPS to grow just 8% for the full year.

Autodesk's revenue increased 16% in fiscal 2022 and it anticipates 13% to 15% growth this year -- even though it faces a few of the same macroeconomic headwinds (especially in Russia and Europe) as Adobe. It expects its adjusted EPS to increase 27% to 31% for the full year.

The valuations and verdict

Adobe trades at 27 times forward earnings and 10 times this year's sales. Autodesk is slightly cheaper: It trades at 26 times forward earnings and eight times this year's sales.

Both stocks have declined more than 30% this year but Autodesk certainly seems like a better value than Adobe right now. Autodesk grew at a slower rate than Adobe in the past but it might weather the near-term headwinds -- and a potential recession -- much better than its larger cloud software peer.

Adobe is still a solid long-term investment but its weak guidance for the rest of the year and its recent price hike indicate that darker days are ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9hbWQtcnl6ZW4tNS01NjAwLWFuZC1yeXplbi01LTU1MDAtcmV2aWV3LzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Ryzen 5 5600 and 5500 Review: Firing Back at Alder Lake,"Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.

AMD Ryzen 5 5600 and 5500 Application Benchmarks — The TLDR

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We can boil down productivity application performance into two broad categories: single- and multi-threaded. These slides show the geometric mean of performance in several of our most important tests in each category but be sure to look at the expanded benchmark results further below.

The Alder Lake chips lead by healthy margins in our cumulative measurement of single-threaded performance with the Core i5-12400 being 14.6% faster than the Ryzen 5 5600 at stock settings and 10% faster after we tune both chips. Meanwhile the stock Core i3-12100 is 19% faster than the Ryzen 5 5500 and overclocking the latter does little to rectify the disparity. You'll have to look to Intel's own Alder Lake family for faster single-threaded performance.

Turning to threaded applications the Core i5-12400 is 2.8% faster than the Ryzen 5 5600 at stock settings and 5.5% faster after tuning. Meanwhile the Ryzen 5 5500 is 19% faster than the Core i3-12100 in threaded work and that increases to 23% after overclocking.

The Core i3-12100 is impressive in single-threaded rendering work leading all competing Ryzen chips in both Cinebench and POV-Ray benchmarks but its quad-core design isn't well suited for the heavily parallelized rendering workloads that you'll see in the real world.

The Core i5-12400 is a closer match for the Ryzen 5 5600 in the threaded benchmarks but the Intel chip often trails only by a slight amount or leads convincingly. Paired with its absolute dominance in lightly-threaded rendering the Core i5-12400 is the better all-rounder for this type of work.

Encoders can be either heavily threaded or almost exclusively single-threaded — there certainly doesn't seem to be a middle ground.



The HandBrake transcoder is heavily threaded and uses AVX instructions to boost performance with the x265 version featuring a heavier distribution of SIMD instructions than the x264 version. The Core i5-12400 and the Ryzen 5 5600 are closely matched in x265 which naturally plays to Intel's strength in AVX work but the 5600 pulls ahead slightly in x264.

Turning to the single-threaded LAME benchmark finds the Intel processors leveraging their generally higher IPC and clock rates to take the lead while the Ryzen 5 5600 takes the lead in the FLAC encoder.



Overall you'll find the 12400 or the 5600 jockeying for the lead in this selection of workloads but the Ryzen 5 5500 easily beats the Core i3-12100 due to its higher core and thread count.

This section includes a diverse set of workloads including exceedingly branchy code in the LLVM compilation workload and the massively parallel molecular dynamics simulation code in NAMD. The Core i3-12100 isn't very potent in these heavily-threaded applications but the Core i5-12400 leads many of the benchmarks. Notably the Ryzen 5 5600 does well in the NAMD workload due to its healthy slab of L2 cache. AMD benefits in the SHA3 AES and HASH benchmarks from its cryptographic optimizations.

Artificial intelligence (AI) unlocks many capabilities that would have been unimaginable a short time ago. Amazon’s cloud-based Rekognition tool part of the suite of solutions under the Amazon Web Services (AWS) umbrella analyzes images and video to recognize faces company logos human sentiment and more in real-time.

Rekognition can be integrated into applications to provide add-on services such as the verification of user identities to insert ads at the appropriate time into online videos or to send smart alerts for deliveries.

See below to learn all about Amazon Rekognition and where it stands in the AI sector:

Amazon and the AI market

The AI market is estimated by Grand View Research to be $93.5 billion and growing fast at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.1%. Fortune Business Insights estimates a market size of $328.34 billion with a CAGR of 20.1%.

Amazon’s Rekognition software can also be considered to be competing in the more narrow AI software market which Markets and Markets estimated to be $58.3 billion in 2020 with a CAGR of 39.7%. By 2022 Gartner researchers forecast a market size of $62.5 billion with a CAGR of 21.3%.

Insider Intelligence estimates of $17.78 billion in revenue for AWS in 2022. Key competitors to Amazon in the general AI market include Advanced Micro Devices AiCure ARM Limited Baidu Enlitic Google IBM Intel Lifegraph and Sensely; however for image and video detection there are several competitors for Amazon such as Clarifai Clearview.ai Kili Microfocus and Google.

Amazon Rekognition key features

Amazon Rekognition key benefits

When selecting an AI-enabled image or video analytics solution customers seek the following key benefits from Amazon Reckognition:

Automated recognition

Humans can see a face and often recognize people expressions or corporate logos at a glance. Computers have much more difficulty but AI-empowered tools have made great advancements in closing the gap.

AI-recognition enables capabilities for embedded applications adds efficiency to security monitoring and provides decision assistance for robotics and self-driving cars. As the technology becomes more widely used we expect to see many more applications realized.

Embedded application capabilities

Embedded automated recognition can provide an application with quick or even real-time recognition of faces celebrities corporate logos personally identifying information (PII) and more. Once an application can recognize people places and things then the application can start to perform tasks related to image or video recognition.

For example cameras feeding video or images into Rekognition can issue smart alerts for deliveries or turn on lights for people entering a room. When embedded into smart phone applications facial recognition can be used by banking software to recognize the user’s face or by help desk software to recognize a user’s level of frustration.

Media analysis

Reality TV shows user-created content and influence advertisements create an enormous number of hours of video footage every day. Tired humans screening content often make mistakes and expose broadcasters and streamers for fees and fines related to unlicensed corporate logos to blur inappropriate content or exposed PII.

AI-enabled tools such as Rekognition detect inappropriate content quickly and in a standardized manner. They can also detect key video segments such as black-screen transitions to speed up and reduce costs for video ad insertion and content production.

Amazon Rekognition use cases

3xLOGIC

A leader in commercial electronic security systems 3xLOGIC manages commercial security systems for a wide variety of customers such as corporations government agencies medical facilities and schools. They needed a solution that provided more understanding than simple motion detectors to help eliminate false alarms for their video monitoring services.

“With over 50000 active cameras in the field many without the advanced analytics of newer and more expensive camera models 3xLOGIC takes on the challenge of false alarms every day” says Charlie Erickson CTO 3xLOGIC Products and Solutions.

“Building training testing and maintaining computer vision models is resource-intensive and has a huge learning curve. With Amazon Rekognition Streaming Video Events we simply call the API and surface the results to our users. It has been very easy to use and the accuracy is impressive.”

Daniel Wellington

The European watch and jewelry maker Daniel Wellington strives to provide customer service as high-end as the products they sell to their customers. However with a number of unique products employees in their 20 offices worldwide could not quickly identify products and needed AI support to improve their efficiency.

“We realized that a common point of friction for our customers is returning an item” says Lezgin Bakircioglu head of global IT operations Daniel Wellington.

“That’s why we have started working on creating a seamless process using Amazon Rekognition. This image recognition service allows us to automate our process and identify all our products and print labels that expedite our warehouse process. Rekognition has become pivotal to our returns process. With it we have been able to process returns 15 times faster and with higher accuracy than we could before thereby eliminating the friction point and creating a better brand experience for our customers.”

National Football League

The National Football League (NFL) receives thousands of media requests for specific players teams or plays and needs to search thousands of media assets for relevant events. As the volume of unstructured data grew exponentially the NFL knew they needed help from an AI to process the data faster and more efficiently.

“By using the new feature in Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels we are able to automatically generate metadata tags tailored to specific use cases for our business and provide searchable facets for our content creation teams” says Brad Boim senior director of post production and asset management NFL Media.

“This significantly improves the speed in which we can search for content and more importantly it enables us to automatically tag elements that required manual efforts before. These tools allow our production teams to leverage this data directly and provide enhanced products to our customers across all of our media platforms.”

Amazon Rekognition differentiators

When trying to decide between different providers of AI-enhanced video and image recognition customers select Amazon’s Rekognition because of the following differentiators.

Brand security: AWS

Few companies can match Amazon’s scale or experience in the cloud. When selecting Rekognition customers obtain the security of Amazon and can expect seamless integrations with other AWS services.

Facial and sentiment recognition expertise

Amazon has been training their facial recognition and sentiment analysis features through constant exposure to feeds from their Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh retail outlets. This extensive training enhances Rekognition for security surveillance customer service and marketing purposes.

Amazon Rekognition can be obtained as part of the AWS Free Tier in which organizations can test products on a limited basis for up to 12 months. In this free tier up to 5000 images can be analyzed and up to 1000 face metadata objects can be stored per month.

As with other AWS products the price depends upon the region in which the service is hosted and the volume. The paid tier starts with image processing costs of $0.001 per image for the first 1 million images analyzed and face metadata storage costs of $0.00001 per metadata per month.

For Rekognition the type of API (Group 1 or Group 2) does not affect the price until over 35 million images have been processed. AWS provides a price calculator to assist with pricing more complicated needs including options such as minutes of video processed detect text celebrity API and PPE detection.

Conclusions

Organizations that need to recognize people places and things accurately and quickly need AI-powered solutions that can embed into their technology. Cloud-based solutions such as Amazon’s Rekognition provide results with reasonable pricing that can service applications worldwide.

Amazon’s features and capabilities should push it to the top of any list of contenders. However the AWS free tier allows for a company to experiment with the tool and establish baseline performance benchmarks before investing fully in any specific solution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ob25nLWtvbmctcG9saWNlLWFkb3B0LWdvb3NlLTAyMjMwOTAyNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hong Kong Police Adopt 'Goose Step' Marching to Boost Patriotism,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong police will officially swap British-style marching for the “goose step” used in mainland China on July 1 as the city sheds signs of its colonial past under Beijing’s growing control.

Most Read from Bloomberg

“To promote patriotism and enhance the awareness of national identity the Hong Kong Police Force will fully adopt Chinese foot drills from July 1” the HKPF said in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Last year China’s People’s Liberation Army trained Hong Kong police cadets on the goose-step style whereby soldiers conduct foot drills without bending their knees. Since then it has been used at local events to promote national security and adopted by the Customs Department.

The official switch will take place on the city’s 25th anniversary of Chinese rule a crucial political event that President Xi Jinping is widely expected to attend in his first trip out of the mainland since January 2020. That date also marks the halfway point in Beijing’s 50-year pledge to maintain the liberal financial and political framework established during colonial British rule.

Britain has accused China of violating that agreement in recent years after Beijing imposed a national security law on the city that’s been used to crack down on dissent and purge the democratic opposition. Beijing also revamped Hong Kong’s electoral system to ensure only those loyal to China’s ruling Communist Party could hold a seat of power.

Earlier this month it emerged that new school textbooks in Hong Kong would teach students the city was never a colony saying the Chinese government never recognized the 19th-century treaties that handed Britain control of Hong Kong.

This thunderstorm video gives you a close-up look at our planet’s explosive nature

Whether you love thunderstorms or hate them it’s hard not to appreciate the latest capture from astrophotographer Andrew McCarthy. McCarthy has captured some astounding photos of the Sun and even the Moon in the past. His latest capture gives us a close-up look at a thunderstorm as it rages across the Earth. The thunderstorm video is also unlike anything else he’s shared in the past.

McCarthy shared the thunderstorm video on Instagram on Thursday. He says that he noticed the storm while driving back home near Tucson Arizona. He had a camera with him at the time so he decided to set it up and capture the storm on video. The result is an absolutely astonishing portrayal of the lightning catching in the clouds.

He made the thunderstorm video using several different photos played in succession. Additionally McCarthy has created a composite of the images and placed it on his website. That photo itself is also astounding showcasing the lightning dark clouds and even star lines in the background. Altogether it’s well worth checking out if you want to see how beautiful nature’s phenomena can be.

Chasing shots

This thunderstorm video isn’t the first time that McCarthy has delivered a beautiful composite for everyone to enjoy. As I noted above he’s previously shared images of the Moon and Sun. In fact one of his most recent photographs showcased the waxing crescent Moon as it passed behind several clouds. He truly has an eye for creating fantastic images that are hard to forget.

In fact he’s actually gone on record about chasing great shots as much as he can. He recently stayed up most of the night to capture a photo of the International Space Station as it passed across the last quarter Moon. The dedication that McCarthy has shown to capturing content like this and the thunderstorm video showcase goes a long way.

Plus his dedication has given us glimpses of fantastic events we might not otherwise have been given. You can see both images on McCarthy’s Instagram. Prints of each instance are also available for a limited time on his website if you’d like to showcase them in your home or office.

Clothes made from 'carbon emissions': Why Zara's new line is just more greenwashing,"By Frankie Leach

The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent in any way the editorial position of Euronews.

This month fast fashion brand Zara released a limited edition line of “sustainable fashion” made of polyester created from captured carbon emissions.

Rather than addressing this crisis of overconsumption by limiting how much they produce and encouraging shoppers to buy fewer items Zara is simply using the guise of sustainability to shift more products and protect the guilty conscience of their consumers.

This month fast fashion brand Zara released a limited-edition line of “sustainable fashion” made of polyester created from captured carbon emissions.

It follows the December 2021 launch of a limited-edition capsule collection which was the first clothing line to use LanzaTech's technology to turn carbon emissions into fabric instead of manufacturing items from virgin fossil resources.

Zara claims that capturing and repurposing carbon emissions from industrial processes limits the direct release of these emissions into the atmosphere and helps limit the use of virgin fossil resources. However the brand has previously come under fire for its role in the fast fashion industry fuelling a culture of overproduction and the ‘buy to wear once mentality’.

As they released this new groundbreaking collection in 2021 Zara’s owner Inditex reported that net profits had doubled to €3.2 billion.

So how do you turn carbon emissions into clothes?

According to a recent report LanzaTech's technology captures CO2 from industrial agricultural or domestic waste processes. Through a fermentation process it is transformed into ethanol a fundamental component in producing materials like PET used in a polyester thread.

The final PET contains 20 per cent MEG (Monoethylene Glycol) made from recycled carbon emissions and 80 per cent PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid).

The organisation's partnership with Inditex has seen it capture steel mill emissions that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere and then recycle the captured emissions into Lanzanol (ethanol) through a fermentation process. The Lanzanol is then converted into low carbon mono ethylene glycol (MEG) by the company India Glycols Limited which is then converted into low carbon polyester yarn used by Zara.

However the resulting textiles are not made from 100 per cent captured carbon.

The MEG provided by Lanzatech makes up 20 per cent of the final polyester with the remaining 80 per cent coming from Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA).

So is this latest venture truly a step in the right direction for the fashion industry in its goal to reduce emissions? Or is it an advanced form of greenwashing concealing a global crisis of overproduction and overconsumption?

Is the collection just greenwashing?

Processes like this are notoriously expensive and on the surface it might seem like a worthy cause but often these elaborate schemes are essentially covering up a much wider issue across the industry.

Put simply brands like Zara are responsible for perpetuating a culture that encourages people to consume as much clothing as possible allowing them to continue producing tonnes of clothing every day which likely will end up in a landfill with an extremely short lifecycle.

This isn’t to say that LanzaTech’s work isn’t commendable but it is by no means a reason to let Zara off the hook for the devastating environmental impacts their production and sales models have on the world.

In March 2022 Inditex FY21 revenues grew 36 per cent to €27.7bn - the brand’s profits are rocketing and based on the fact this is down to selling more clothes it seems a drop in the ocean to suggest just a single line of Zara’s entire output was made partly from recycled carbon emissions.

The so-called solution is an expensive and energy-intensive sticking plaster over a global issue – a sure-fire way to divert money and political attention from the real bold changes we need.

Orsola de Castro co-founder and creative director of Fashion Revolution believes that a brand needs to address the root causes of its impact not just its effects… “increased quality of life for supply chain workers and a decrease in over-production for its customers.

All else is not to be seen as a step in the right direction but as a way to confuse well-meaning customers also known as greenwashing” she says.

Dr Stephen Wise Chief Strategic Development Officer at environmental biotechnology company Advetec agrees.

For Wise the idea of using technology to take carbon out of the air may sound like an attractive and sensible solution to our escalating climate crisis but in reality carbon capture use and storage is at best greenwashing due to the fossil fuels and carbon emitting processes in the first place.

“The so-called solution is an expensive and energy-intensive sticking plaster over a global issue – prevention not cure and a sure-fire way to divert money and political attention from the real bold changes we need.”

The carbon emitting processes we ignore

In terms of the project’s overall feasibility and effectiveness Wise notes that “carbon can only be captured at the energy generation stage and doesn’t take into account any of the logistics involved in industries such as fashion.

“Any carbon emitted through sea or air transportation of materials and products cannot be captured and will therefore continue to be released into the atmosphere as emissions” he adds.

What’s more greenwashing can often be used as a cover in the fashion industry for more sinister and unethical practices such as modern slavery and other human rights abuses across supply chains.

De Castro says that without an ethical production process any attempts at sustainability are futile. “Unless all supply chain workers are paid a dignified living wage and unless fast fashion brands such as Zara commit to producing adequately instead of excessively everything else is a plaster on a seeping wound” she says.

Companies in the industry clearly recognise the growing movement within the industry to reduce emissions but initiatives like this just give cover to shoppers to continue buying and wasting more.

The right air freshener can transform your space by eliminating stale odors and leaving a more pleasant scent in their place. Yet with so many on the market it can be hard to find the air freshener that strikes the right balance being enjoyable but not overpowering. That’s why we’ve tracked down the top 10 air fresheners to make your home smell sparkling clean—each one of them up to the challenge.

The Best Air Fresheners

What to Consider

There’s a difference between masking odor and going to the root of the problem so if there’s something seriously stinky in your home you’ll want to deep clean that first. But for more general smells that linger after you’ve scrubbed and polished a good air freshener can make a world of difference. To get the job done you’ve got many more options than may first meet the eye including sprays gels wax melts and more. We chose products that were powerful but not pungent with a focus on those with a more natural aroma.

How We Selected

Air fryers have become increasingly popular in recent years with retailers selling them for affordable prices. It’s no wonder they’ve grown in popularity though they can cook just about anything in about half the time an oven would. You can use air fryers to cook potatoes chicken and even bake cakes in it.

They can also make food crispy without oil too so they can be a healthier option. Due to it being used almost everyday in my household it can become extremely dirty. It is also often forgotten about when it comes to cleaning and so when it comes to tacking the air fryer it is a big cleaning job. My air fryer has lots of elements to it making it tricky to clean.

Our Airbnb Experience In Gran Canaria Spain

Airbnb is a popular target of scorn amongst travel bloggers and this is often justified. Personally I’ve had my fair share of bad experiences with the service and I also find the added fees tacked on to bookings make Airbnb far less of a deal versus a hotel.

My sister-in-law actually arranged this booking and our trip was supposed to take place in December 2020. We figured the Canary Islands would be a nice escape from the waves of COVID-19 hitting the USA as well England and Germany (where my wife’s side of the family lives). That trip was cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns and thankfully the host Pilar let us rebook to August 2021.

We chose this house because it had four bedrooms (eight beds total) with three bathrooms a full kitchen plenty of parking and a swimming pool. These days it looks to be as cheap as $125/night though the rate varies based upon the season and it was closer to $300/night for our stay (still a good deal considering the space and privacy we had).

Gran Canaria is not the largest of the Canary Islands but is quite large and our house was located in San Nicolas de Tolentino which is still in Las Palmas but a good 45 minute drive from either direction (a ring road encircles the island).

We were fairly isolated though I must rue that we are awakened every morning at sunrise by roosters in the area. Earplugs did the trick though I was happy for the “local alarm” and would get up and complete my work before others awakened. The days were hot the mornings cool.

Below are some pictures from our stay. The interior pictures are from Airbnb. We arrived at 1:00AM and everyone just went to bed. By morning everyone was unpacked and my own pictures of the bedrooms bathrooms and indoor common areas included too much clutter.

Like so many homes in Europe the doors lock from the inside as well as the outside. On two occasions we locked ourselves out whilst sitting in the backyard. Thankfully the host was just a phone call and short ride away. Pilar was wonderful. I still think those doors are tremendous safety hazards.

CONCLUSION

This stay restored my willingness to rent using the Airbnb platform. We had a nice house which proved to be a suitable base even though it was on the other side of island. There are many all-inclusive hotels on Gran Canaria but I would always choose a house over something like that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi9vbWctZnVuZC1haXJibmItMTAtbWlsbGlvbi1idWlsZC1jcmF6eS1wcm9wZXJ0eS1kZXNpZ27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OMG!

5 Planets Align For 1st Time After 18 Yrs In Rare Planetary Conjunction To Naked-Eye; How And Where To Watch It

5 Planets Align For 1st Time After 18 Yrs In Rare Planetary Conjunction To Naked-Eye; How And Where To Watch It

The rare planet alignment will feature a total of seven planets. The best time to watch is about half an hour before sunrise between June 24 and 27.

5 Planets Align For 1st Time After 18 Yrs In Rare Planetary Conjunction To Naked-Eye; How And Where To Watch It

5 Planets Alignment 2022: Five major planets — Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter and Saturn — in our solar system are lined up in a row for rare planetary conjunction visible to the naked eye. In a clear sky the planets can be seen shining before dawn. It is a special opportunity to see Mercury which is usually obscured from view by the Sun’s bright light the BBC reported on Friday.

The conjunction was brightest on Friday morning but will remain visible until Monday from most parts of the world. The last time this conjunction happened was 2004 and it won’t be seen again until 2040 the report said. The planets appear “like a string of pearls spread out from close to the horizon” explains space scientist and chief stargazer at the Society for Popular Astronomy Prof Lucie Green. It is also a special event because the planets appear in the order they are positioned from the sun.

🪐 Planets align. It’s fine. What is time? Does that even rhyme? Look up starting tonight to see Venus Mars Jupiter and Saturn spread out and appear to line up in the sky. The crescent moon joins them on June 23: https://t.co/36QwkIxfaw pic.twitter.com/uh5V9W2q45 — NASA (@NASA) June 19 2022

That is not always the case for planetary conjunctions because of our perspective from Earth looking into the solar system Prof Green says. On Friday a crescent Moon also joined the line-up appearing between Venus and Mars.

How can one watch this conjunction?

Even though the celestial event of 5 planet alignment is visible from the naked eye if you are someone who is at a place with poor weather conditions the virtual telescope project is live-streaming the conjunction as seen through a telescope positioned in Rome. This means it could be live-streamed while staying at home.

The 5 planet conjunction can also be seen on the other days of the month. To watch the celestial event you can wake up early before the sun rises and get an obstructed view of the horizon at the place where you can plan to witness the grand astronomical event.

Five planet alignment Date

The alignment of 5 planets- Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter and Saturn will occur in the morning of June 24. The conjunction of 5 planets can be best seen on June 24 however it will remain visible until June 27 from most parts of the world.

When to watch the rare planetary conjunction

The best time to see the planet alignment 2022 will be between 3.39 am and sunrise at 4.43 am on the morning of June 24 2022. Saturn will lead out the parade raising around 23.21 PM local time (June 23) for those in New York. The exact timing of the 5 planet alignment will vary depending on the specific locations.

‘There has never been a better time to be a dental technician’ – Ashley Byrne explores the evolution of dental technology in the past 25 years and how it has transformed from an archaic mess to aspirational art.

Whilst this article is about the history of dental technology it’s hard not to tell a little of my story. Coincidentally I started on my journey to becoming a dental technician just over 25 years ago .

I’m 44 years young now and 25 years ago I was a 19 year old in my second year of becoming a dental technician at Manchester Met University. This is one year after my dad a very successful dental technician and lab owner had said to me ‘Whatever you decide to do do NOT become a dental technician’.

It’s funny how ignoring that advice was probably the best decision I ever made.

Past

Twenty-five years ago dental technology was a very different industry to what it is now. Wax Bunsen burners hot furnaces no air conditioning and a weird smell that I can still remember now – not unpleasant just weird. Every lab had that same smell.

Digital didn’t exist but it was literally on the cusp (pardon the pun) of hitting the industry. Yet no one knew why on earth we needed to digitise it. I remember technicians smoking at the bench and everything being dusty.

Chalk and cheese

Back in 1997 I was working at two labs – a placement at John Wibberley’s implant and crown and bridge lab as part of my degree course and at a small denture lab in Oldham. Despite being close to each other these labs were chalk and cheese.

John was setting a new standard of high-end crown bridge and implant work in a spacious light clean and tidy lab. He was also working with high profile dentists that were at the cutting edge of implant work.

My other lab was a paid role. I always remember my first day in a small dark unit 11 people crammed in making more than 50 sets of dentures a day. When the boss asked me how many special trays and bite blocks I could make in a day they all laughed at me when I said two. They wanted 50 and 50 per day. I felt a bit of an idiot but they took me on. It wasn’t long before I was smashing them out.

Shellac trays hand bent metal handles and then bite blocks in pure wax. It was filthy messy noisy and people were swearing left right and centre. I loved it.

It was fast-paced hard work and it burnt my fingers but when I finally hit 50 a day I swear I was the best paid student in the whole of Manchester. I had money to burn and boy was I loving dental technology.

Archaic

When I look back at my career at the industry and all the labs that I have visited on and off over the years in many different countries a lot has changed.

Twenty-five years ago our industry was archaic and out of date. It was analog and messy. Digital dentistry simply didn’t exist.

It was long hours and poorly paid. Nearly every technician I knew was working late and many weekends were lost for false teeth. It was naturally a dirty industry but labs were changing.

Both my dad’s lab and John’s lab were clean and tidy. People were getting work life balance back and labs were putting themselves out there with marketing and branded packaging rather than the usually bubble wrap and a plastic bag.

Present

Scanner advancement

The biggest changes we have seen as an industry though has been technology and the amazing work of digital dentistry. I remember seeing a MOD-30 at my dad’s lab around 23 years ago. This machine was set to change the industry.

And it did. Nobel Biocare (as it is now called) launched the scanner and it promised accurate automated alumina copings made on a production line in Sweden. Never had anyone seen a product made outside their own labs except for silver dies – and that was usually from a local lab.

The scanner ran on MS-DOS and its awful screen with red tops used a state-of-the-art scan probe from Renishaw. To this day it still makes the world’s most accurate scanner.

Providing the preps were good this worked great. But I clearly remember hearing people swearing that the touch probe had snapped a small die that the model worker had tried to pour three times without breaking. Like it or loathe it that scanner was the start of a major breakthrough for dental technology.

Scanners improved as did the technology and several others soon caught up. They were faster leaner and ran on better software. Soon bridges started appearing. This was a big switch from singles but like all innovation there were a lot of people with burnt fingers. But hey that’s development.

Digital dentures

The denture world also started to change. Although there was no digitisation it was in materials and standardisation where we saw advancements.

So Shellac was out (thankfully for my fingers). Light cure materials appeared and cartridge injection systems became the norm. The simple-to-use Ivocap system from Ivoclar was a game changer in the dental world. It was only replaced a few years ago with the launch of a new system that removed the need to use vast vats of hot water.

Now though the hottest topic in the dental world is digital dentures.

Crowns bridges implants

Crowns bridges and implants are the areas that have seen the largest technology changes over the past decade.

Scanners switched from contact to light and we started to see serious developments in software. Several start-ups appeared with their own software and scanner combinations. This helped push the manufacturing side of our industry.

Alumina copings were fast losing their popularity to materials like Zirconia. In addition we started to see milled Titanium for abutments and even some copings for bonded crowns. Whilst bonded Titanium never really took off milled abutments and Zirconia are simply the norm in a dental lab these days.

Driven by a desire to improve what we did as an industry and coupled with a search for efficiency gains labs have really embraced the digital workflow in their crown bridge and implant labs.

New recognition

Everyone knows that I’m an advocate for technology. However let’s also recognise what it takes to enable those advancements in our industry.

It is over 15 years ago that dental technicians were allowed to be professionally registered with the GDC taking our industry to new levels. To become a dental technician now requires a qualification and CPD ensuring we remain informed skilled and accountable for our actions. This was a major step forward for the recognition of an industry that many considered a backward and unregulated aspect of dentistry.

The last eight years have been a revolution for the dental industry as whole not just technically. Digitisation has taken a hold across all aspects and we have seen enormous changes from how we used to work.

The launch of intra oral scans has really changed the digital revolution. Whilst this growth was slow it is now mainstream for many labs with a further boost in the take up of the technology post-pandemic.

Of course intraoral scanners had a major downfall when launched – that was the limitation of model production. Companies like Cadent now owned by Align Technology offered a robust milled solution.

But what came next revolutionised the industry like no other product.

3D printing

3D printing was invented predominantly for rapid prototyping – one-off manufacturing at its best. Dental technology is of course exactly that. It is rare that we make the same product twice so when 3D printing started appearing in dental technology the level of excitement went through the roof.

The start was through the major players offering a printing service for models. I think everyone would agree that the initial attempts where somewhat poor but let’s face it – that’s how every change in dental technology has started.

Whilst these enormous European production centres dominated the 3D printing model market it wasn’t long before small in-house printers started changing the game again. The early in-house printers were a serious winner for labs offering accurate in-house model production.

The only downside was the 12-hour print cycle which was manageable unless you had a failure overnight. When this happened that elation of printing soon turned into pain.

It wasn’t long before these ‘hobby’ printers started to show just why they were called ‘hobby’: they broke down as fast as they got repaired. Most large labs like us had banks of them just waiting for the next failure. When they worked it was truly magnificent using software to make models special trays splints guides and jigs – all manageable and scalable.

This push from lab techs ensured huge investment in the market. It wasn’t long before we welcomed the larger industrial printers and in-house printers that work reliably and long term.

Future

Changing for the better

Where we stand now 25 years later it is honestly quite remarkable how the industry has changed for the better. The messy labs of yesteryear are disappearing and being replaced by clean high-tech manufacturing facilities mixing incredible technology with fine art.

Printers are now making dentures and complex implant restorations. This allows the modern dental technician to eliminate the messy and time-consuming aspects of our industry to focus on the fun clean areas like CAD milling printing and artistic finishing.

The art form is far from being lost; in fact it’s having a revival.

Dental technicians over the last 25 years have maybe not realised their potential. Sadly this has usually been our own fault – fighting for low prices undercutting each other and a lack of willingness to help our industry colleagues.

This has firmly changed in recent years and the openness and willingness to share concepts ideas and methods has never been stronger.

Sadly we are in a serious decline in numbers. Several stats indicate the average age of technicians is around 56-58 which is rather top heavy.

New generation

Yet the future is bright. With modern CAD and 3D printing we are attracting a new generation of dental technician. They see themselves working nine til five and producing world class restorations whilst still earning an excellent salary.

It’s now a completely different industry to when I started and I personally do not think there has ever been a better time to be a dental technician. It’s almost ironic that when I started a lot of dental technicians aspired to be a dentist.

Yet now 25 years later many dentists who walk around my lab and admire the normal hours the lack of stress and the incredible tools (many call them toys!) that we have to play with…well the tables may have turned. To be a dental technician is aspirational.

‘There has never been a better time to be a dental technician’

All of these advancements have ensured the dental technician is now more than ever also an integral part of the dental team. As technology has become our norm dentists are leaning on labs more for information and knowledge on digital methods and solutions.

New materials methods and techniques have empowered technicians and our clinicians need our assistance and advice more than ever ensuring the dental team is very restoratively lead.

The last 25 years have been an incredible journey for our industry. As we move forward from our messy analog history we must all be pioneers on these new high-tech and amazing ways of working.

The artistry is still the key aspect of our jobs. However the advancement of technology is allowing us to remove the mundane aspects and really improve our work-life balance our patient offerings and all-in-all make dentistry a vastly better place.

""After the first 15 MB of the file Googlebot stops crawling and only considers the first 15 MB of the file for indexing"" Google said.

""The file size limit is applied on the uncompressed data"" it added.

As per the report this left some in the SEO community wondering if this meant Googlebot would completely disregard text that fell below images at the cutoff in HTML files.

""It is specific to the HTML file itself like it's written"" John Mueller Google Search Advocate clarified via Twitter.

""Embedded resources/content pulled in with IMG tags is not a part of the HTML file"" he added.

It also means images and videos should be compressed not be encoded directly into the HTML whenever possible.

WASHINGTON

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on June 23 said it was ordering all products produced by Juul Labs off the market after finding the vaping giant had failed to address certain safety concerns.

The decision which Juul said it would appeal clears the way for rival brands to increase their share of the market it once dominated.

It is also a blow for tobacco giant Altria maker of Marlboro cigarettes which acquired a 35 stake in Juul in 2018 to diversify its business strategy in the face of falling smoking rates.

“Today’s action is further progress on the FDA’s commitment to ensuring that all e-cigarette and electronic nicotine delivery system products currently being marketed to consumers meet our public health standards” said FDA Commissioner Robert Califf in a statement.

Products affected include the Juul device and its pods which currently come in the flavors Virginia tobacco and in menthol at nicotine concentrations of five and three percent.

After completing a two-year review of the company’s marketing application the FDA found the data presented “lacked sufficient evidence regarding the toxicological profile of the products” it said.

“In particular some of the company’s study findings raised concerns due to insufficient and conflicting data including regarding genotoxicity and potentially harmful chemicals leaching from the company’s proprietary e-liquid pods” it added.

Juul was blamed for a surge in youth vaping over its marketing of fruit and candy flavored e-cigarettes which it stopped selling in 2019.

In January 2020 the FDA said sale of e-cigarettes in flavors other than tobacco or menthol would be illegal unless specifically authorized by the government.",,,,,,,,,

LAS VEGAS — What happens to jobs the economy and business when a company can create the perfect worker out of silicon and steel? Amazon’s new warehouse robots unveiled this week could have lasting implications for the company and its workforce at a pivotal moment for technology and the labor movement.

In addition to developing and deploying its own fleet of robots Amazon is keeping an eye on technology that’s further out on the horizon as demonstrated by its investment in Agility Robotics maker of a bipedal warehouse robot called Digit. (Amazon hasn’t yet signaled any plans to use Digit in its own operations.)

Amazon says it sees immense long-term benefits for worker safety productivity and efficiency with robots ultimately helping humans do better and more fulfilling work not taking their jobs. The company points to the fact that it has hired a million people in the past decade more than twice the number of robots in its operations.

“We build our machines so that humans are at the center of the robotics universe” said Tye Brady chief technologist for Amazon Robotics unveiling the new robots on stage in Las Vegas this week at re:MARS an Amazon conference focusing on machine learning automation robotics and space.

He added “At the highest level the very highest level we aim to extend human capability and build collaboration between people and machines.”

Others see it from a different perspective. Philip Su a former Microsoft and Facebook software engineering leader who worked the peak season last year inside an Amazon warehouse welcomes the safety improvements promised by the new robots and feels empathy for the union movement based on his experience.

However he says it’s hard to overlook the pragmatic implications.

“The higher the standards and protection that unions or other facilities provide workers the higher the motivation for a company like Amazon to quickly invest in and deploy these sorts of labor-removing technologies” Su said.

On this episode of the GeekWire Podcast recorded on location at Amazon re:MARS in Las Vegas we sit down with Amazon’s Tye Brady to talk about the new robots. Then we jump on the line to reconnect with recent GeekWire Podcast guest Philip Su to get his take on all of this after he watched Brady’s presentation.

In recent months several hundred staffers have been pushing the e-commerce giant to ban books like “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters.” They say such titles dehumanize trans people and dismiss their identities as mental disorders which runs counter to the recommendations of almost every major medical group. Employees say the books could confuse vulnerable teens and their parents who turn to Amazon seeking information.

“It’s pretty jarring to see books that are promoting that trans people should not transition in the LGBT book section” said Lina Jodoin who transitioned two years ago and quit her engineering job at Amazon last month in protest. “It just hurts on a personal level.”

The internal backlash began more than a year ago via employee chat rooms then spilled into public in March when more than 400 workers signed a petition demanding that senior management stop selling certain books and convene a panel to determine whether the titles violate Amazon’s policies against hate speech. The activism ratcheted up earlier this month when about 30workers belonging to a group called No Hate at Amazon participated in a “die-in” during a Pride celebration at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters.

To date more than 600 employees have signed the petition and about 20 workers have quit the company due to the sale of titles they say misrepresent what it means to be transgender according to a member of the group. Several other transgender employees are also planning to quit after they complete certain gender-affirming treatments a complex and personal processthat can take years and could be disrupted by switching jobs and insurance plans said the person who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.

The planned demonstration during the Seattle Pride Parade which is expected to attract as many as 500000 observers will be No Hate at Amazon’s most visible protest to date. Three months ago Seattle Pride organizers also dropped Amazon as a corporate sponsor citing its support of lawmakers and organizations that support anti-LGBTQ legislation.

“We respect that many people care deeply about this topic and we remain committed to providing an inclusive work environment for all of our 1.6 million employees” Amazon spokesperson Maggie Sivon said in an emailed statement. “As a company we believe strongly in diversity equity and inclusion. As a bookseller we’ve chosen to offer a very broad range of viewpoints including books that conflict with our company’s stated positions. We believe that it’s possible to do both—to offer a broad range of viewpoints in our bookstore and to stand behind our values as a company. When reviewing a book against our content guidelines we consider the specific content of that book and we invest significant time and resources to ensure our guidelines are applied as consistently as possible.”

Deciding what items to ban is a constant challenge for Amazon which typically declines to yank products until public pressure threatens to dent its reputation. In 2015 the company pulled Confederate flag merchandise from its web store but only after Walmart Inc. and EBay Inc. banned them first. Amazon is frequently called out for selling Nazi memorabilia and other merchandise deemed anti-Semitic such as Christmas ornaments celebrating Auschwitz the infamous Nazi death camp. More than half the goods sold on Amazon come from independent merchants who post their own merchandise on the site through online portals making the sprawling online marketplace difficult to police.

For example Amazon last year stopped selling the book “When Harry Became Sally” saying it dismissed transgender people as having mental disorders. But a Bloomberg reporter found the book on the web store this week while reporting this story. It was removed after the reporter asked Amazon about it.

Employees are struggling to understand why Amazon banned that book but continues to carry other titles with similar themes. They suspect a backlash from Republican lawmakers may have given the company pause. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida for one accused Amazon of censorship after it stopped selling “When Harry Became Sally.”

Of particular concern to the employee activists is “Irreversible Damage” which appears at the top of search results when an Amazon shopper types in “transgender.” Written by Abgail Shrier the 2020 book uses anecdotal evidence to suggest that teens identifying as trans is a passing “trend” that can be traced back to mental health issues. It has a 4.7-star rating and more than 6000 Amazon reviews.

Shrier and Regnery Publishing didn’t respond to requests for comment. On its website the publisher said “Abigail Shrier’s essential book will help you understand what the trans craze is and how you can inoculate your child against it—or how to retrieve her from this dangerous path.”

Another target is “Johnny the Walrus” a children’s book by conservative commentator Matt Walsh about a boy who thinks he’s a marine mammal. The boy’s mother caving to pressure from “the internet people” feeds him worms and takes him to a saw-wielding doctor who suggests turning his hands and feet into fins.

A spokesperson for the title’s publisher the Daily Wire-owned DW Books applauded Amazon for “dismissing demands by its woke employees” adding that “with nearly 100000 copies sold on Amazon alone it’s clear there is a huge demand for “Johnny the Walrus” by Amazon customers and we are thrilled with the book’s massive success.”

Some Amazon employees express frustration that their employer is willing to take a position on some issues—supporting the Black Lives Matter movement say or providing relief to Ukrainians fending off the Russian invasion—but is unwilling to ban all books they consider anti-transgender.

GLAAD a LGBTQ media watchdog group says the company has failed to honor the pledge it made last year not to sell books misrepresenting LGBTQ people as mentally ill. “Amazon should keep that promise adhere to its own content guidelines that forbid hate speech and stop misrepresenting these titles as anything other than what they are: harmful anti-LGBTQ misinformation and propaganda” a spokesperson for the advocacy group said.

Jodoin who knew she was transgender when she was 18 is particularly concerned that parents reading books like “Irreversible Damage” could deny their children’s transgender identity with potentially devastating consequences. Transgender and nonbinary teens were more likely than their cisgender peers to consider or attempt suicide in the past year according to a survey of LGBTQ youth conducted by the mental-health advocacy group The Trevor Project. Respondents who were threatened with or subjected to harmful and discredited practices known as conversion therapy were also more likely to report suicidal ideation than those who had not. At least 20 states have banned the use of conversion therapy on children.

“It’s especially dangerous when it’s this marketplace as big as Amazon” Jodoin said. “If we bill ourselves as the world’s biggest bookstore that comes with a lot of responsibility.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi9maWxtL25ld3Mvdmlja3ktZWd1aWEtcHItZXhlY3V0aXZlLWFtYXpvbi1kaWVzLTEyMzUzMDM1MTQv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIyL2ZpbG0vbmV3cy92aWNreS1lZ3VpYS1wci1leGVjdXRpdmUtYW1hem9uLWRpZXMtMTIzNTMwMzUxNC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vicky Eguia Public Relations Executive at Amazon Studios Dies at 48,"Vicky Eguia a public relations executive at Amazon who helped create Oscar-winning campaigns for “Manchester By the Sea” and “The Salesman” died Saturday. She was 48.

The cause was cancer her family said on social media.

Eguia most recently served as director of PR for diversity equity and inclusion and community relations at Amazon. She joined the company in 2015 to head publicity for its original movies arm and played a critical role in helping the streaming service forge into the world of awards seasons and theatrical distribution as it was looking to compete more aggressively in the film business.

In a note to staff Amazon Studios head Jen Salke and public relations chief Cory Shields wrote “As many of you know so well Vicky was a consummate team player – always ready to pitch in with complete commitment and dedication. We will all miss her charm and sense of humor.”

In 2017 Amazon became the first streaming service to earn an Oscar nomination for best picture with “Manchester by the Sea.” After Amazon bought the film at the Sundance Film Festival Eguia helped design the publicity strategy for the movie a searing drama that became both a critical and commercial hit. At Amazon Eguia showed a flair for getting attention for foreign language films and arthouse releases such as “The Salesman” “Cold War” and “Les Misérables” all of which scored Oscar nominations. She also worked on the campaigns for such Amazon releases as “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” “Brittany Runs a Marathon” “The Big Sick” “One Night in Miami” and “Coming 2 America.”

Whip-smart wickedly funny and tireless Eguia was widely respected by the Hollywood trade reporters who blew up her phone at all hours of the day and night in the hunt for information about festival acquisitions or casting. She also had a deep love for movies and the artists who make them forging many close friendships with the filmmakers whose projects she helped introduce to the world.

In her decades-long career in publicity Eguia worked at Millennium Entertainment Apparition Picturehouse and Newmarket Films. She played a key part in the publicity efforts for such films as “Bernie” “Bright Star” “A Prairie Home Companion” “The Passion of the Christ” and “Monster.” At Picturehouse she also helped design awards campaigns for “Pan’s Labyrinth” and “La Vie en Rose.”

Eguia began her career in 2000 as an account executive at Rogers & Cowen in the film department.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NsaW1hdGUtd2lsZGZpcmVzLXBvbGl0aWNzLXByZXNpZGVudGlhbC1lbGVjdGlvbnMtZGVmb3Jlc3RhdGlvbi1kOWE0YTg4NGQ4YjFkZTY4YTkzZmIzNmYyYTRiZWY4YtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Colombian president pledges to protect rainforest,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Gustavo Petro Colombia’s first elected leftist president will take office in August with ambitious proposals to halt the record-high rates of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Petro has promised to limit agribusiness expansion into the forest and create reserves where Indigenous communities and others are allowed to harvest rubber acai and other non-timber forest products. He has also pledged income from carbon credits to finance replanting.

“From Colombia we will give humanity a reward a remedy a solution: not to burn the Amazon rainforest anymore to recover it to its natural frontier to give humanity the possibility of life on this planet” Petro wearing an Indigenous headdress said to a crowd in the Amazon city of Leticia during his campaign.

But to do that he first needs to establish reign over large lawless areas.

The task of stopping deforestation seems more challenging than ever. In 2021 the Colombian Amazon lost 98000 hectares (more than 240000 acres) of pristine forest to deforestation and another 9000 hectares (22000 acres) to fire. Both were down from what they had been in 2020 but 2021 was still the fourth worst year on record according to Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP) an initiative of the nonprofit Amazon Conservation Association.

More than 40% of Colombia is in the Amazon an area roughly the size of Spain. The country has the world’s largest bird biodiversity mainly because it includes transition zones between the Andes mountains and the Amazon lowlands. Fifteen percent of the Colombian Amazon has already been deforested according to Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development or FCDS.

Destruction of the forest has been on the rise since 2016 the year Colombia signed a peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC that ended decades of a bloody armed conflict.

“The peace process allowed people to return to formerly conflict-ridden rural areas. As the returning population increasingly used the natural resources it contributed to deforestation and increases in forest fires especially in the Amazon and the Andes-Amazon transition regions” according to a new paper in the journal “Environmental Science and Policy.”

The presence of the State is barely felt in Colombia’s Amazon. “Once the armed groups were demobilized they left the forest free for cattle ranching illegal mining and drug trafficking” said Ruth Consuelo Chaparro director of the Roads to Identity Foundation in a telephone interview. “The State has not filled the gaps.”

The main driver of deforestation has been the expansion of cattle ranching. Since 2016 the number of cattle in the Amazon has doubled to 2.2 million. In the same period about 500000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of forest were lost according to FCDS based on official data.

This cattle expansion goes hand in hand with illegally-seized land said FCDS director Rodrigo Botero. “The big business deal is the land. The cows are just a way to get hold of these territories” he told the AP in a phone interview.

Experts affirm that illegally-seized lands are often resold to ranchers who then run their cattle free of land use restrictions such as the propriety’s size.

Most of the destruction occurs in an “arc of deforestation” in the northwestern Colombian Amazon where even protected areas have not been spared. Chiribiquete the world’s largest national park protecting a tropical rainforest has lost around 6000 hectares (14800 acres) since 2018 according to MAAP.

During the campaign Botero took Petro and other presidential candidates on separate one-day trips to the Amazon. They flew over cattle ranching areas national parks and Indigenous territories.

“A very interesting thing Petro and other candidates said was that they never imagined the magnitude of the destruction.” The feeling of ungovernability made a deep impression on each of them Botero said.

Almost 60% of Colombia’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture deforestation and other land use according to the World Resources Institute. In 2020 under the Paris Agreement Colombian President Ivan Duque’s government committed to a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030. To do that it pledged to reach net-zero deforestation by 2030.

The Amazon is the world’s largest tropical rainforest and an enormous carbon sink. There is widespread concern that its destruction will not only release massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere further complicating hopes of arresting climate change but also push it past a tipping point after which much of the forest will begin an irreversible process of degradation into tropical savannah.

Although it holds almost half of the nation’s territory the Amazon is the least populated part of Colombia so historically it is neglected during presidential campaigns.

This year’s campaign was not a complete departure from that. But this year for the first time there was a TV presidential debate dedicated solely to environmental issues before the first round in the election. Petro who was leading the polls then refused to participate.

In his government program Petro further promises to prioritize collective land titles such as Indigenous reservations and zones for landless farmers. He also promises to control migration into the Amazon fight illegal activities such as land seizures drug trafficking and money laundering via land purchases.

Petro’s press manager did not respond to requests for comment.

“Petro has studied and understands deforestation” said Consuelo Chaparro whose organization works with Indigenous tribes in the Amazon. But the president alone can do nothing she said. Her hope is that he will listen and move things forward. ”We don’t expect him to be a Messiah.”

TURLOCK Calif. — A Turlock woman is still on edge after she said an Amazon delivery driver tried to attack her in her own home.

The homeowner who identified herself as Maria and did not want to be shown on camera told ABC10 she was terrified when it happened. She said her husband answered the door after there was a knock on it Friday morning around noon.

""The employee was trying to sell a box that he had to deliver in Atwater but he was trying to sell it to my husband and my husband since he's Mexican - he doesn't speak English - he was all like 'Hey deal with this guy because I don't know what he's saying'"" she said.

Maria walked over to the door as her husband walked away but that's when she said the delivery driver entered her home and things took a violent turn.

""His face like changed. His eyes opened wide and he said 'You look good' and then he was trying to attack me"" Maria said.

She said she pushed the driver away after he tried to touch her.

""I pushed him and then my husband came and he struggled with him to push him out the door"" Maria said.

The suspect was identified by Turlock Police Department as Ryan Lee Crisp 22 of Modesto. Maria said Crisp then jumped the fence leading to the backyard and tried to get into her home by breaking her daughter's bedroom window.

""I was in the bathroom locked with the (911) operator and then my husband had a friend out here so he called his friend for help so the friend came and they restrained him until the cops came"" Maria said.

Crisp was detained by Turlock police and taken to the Stanislaus County Jail where he was booked on felony charges of attempted rape burglary and vandalism. Turlock police said Crisp is employed by Soon Express a third party company that is partnered with Amazon.

Despite the arrest the trauma still lingers for Maria as she continues to fear for her own safety.

""I'm trying to tell everyone that I know not to open the door for none of them because you don't know what they're gonna do"" Maria said.

Amazon provided the following statement to ABC10 about the incident.

""We’re deeply concerned about what we’ve learned. This does not reflect the standards we have for delivery drivers. As this is an ongoing investigation we must refer all questions to the Turlock Police Department” a spokesperson said.

Maria is now planning to increase security at her home.

""I told my husband we got to put cameras. We're gonna put bars on the windows"" Maria said.

Turlock Police Department believes this was an isolated incident and authorities are working to confirm that to be the case.

Anyone with information regarding the incident can call Turlock Police Department.

The DOT believes the Delta-LATAM JV will likely generate public benefits while the US-South America market would remain sufficiently open to existing and new competition. Nonetheless it has placed certain conditions on final antitrust immunity.

The DOT said: “the Department proposes the following critical remedies and conditions to address these issues: maintenance of current third-party interline agreements the removal of exclusivity provisions a 10-year expiration and reassessment requirement and the removal of a capacity constraint clause located in the joint venture agreement which artificially limits growth during the initial stages of the proposed relationship.”

The two parties now have 14 days to respond to the tentative decision. In a joint statement the airlines said:

“LATAM Group and Delta Air Lines welcome the US Department of Transportation’s (DOT) preliminary decision to approve their US/Canada-South America (Brazil Chile Colombia Paraguay Peru and Uruguay) Joint Venture agreement which will significantly enhance travel options for customers traveling between the two regions. Once the DOT confirms its decision the airlines will work to deepen their strategic alliance enabling them to offer consumer benefits including increased flight availability more routes between the US/Canada and South America enhanced frequent flyer benefits as well as access to shared facilities and services at the airports where the airlines operate.”

A closer look at Delta and LATAM’s JV

Both companies announced they would file for a Joint Venture Agreement in 2020. This JV would allow them to plan price and share revenues and costs covering routes between the United States and Canada on one end and the South American region on the other. It would also allow them to compete better against American Airlines and United Airlines which already have partnerships with Latin American carriers such as GOL JetSMART and Copa Airlines.

The proposed JV is an incremental profit and loss-sharing alliance that provides for metal

neutrality between the carriers and covers all nonstop flights between North America and the South American regions as well as flights connecting to the nonstop services that operate within the geographic scope of the proposed JV.

According to the two airlines the JV will:

Cover 7000 city-pair markets;

Provide new or expanded service on at least 18 nonstop routes;

Provide approximately $460 million in estimated annual consumer benefits;

Optimize connectivity between Delta’s and LATAM’s hub networks;

Lower prices by jointly setting fares and managing seat inventory by up to $56 million annually;

Create an immunized network that provides critical mass to compete against the larger American Airlines and United Airlines networks in the region; and

Use efficiencies of the combined operations to optimize aircraft utilization enhance schedules and lower costs with a joint sales force to target key customers.

The benefits

With the JV in place Delta and LATAM estimate they will attract 1000000 more annual U.S.-South America passengers that would have otherwise flown on competing carriers. They estimate capacity will increase more than 68% once demand conditions return to pre-pandemic normal levels.

Both carriers’ networks are largely complementary and the only route overlap exists in the New York-Sao Paulo city-pair market. LATAM and Delta proposed new reinstated or expanded services on at least 18 routes.

Moreover if the JV is approved LATAM will have increased access to North American markets over Delta’s Atlanta Boston Los Angeles and New York City hubs and Delta will have increased access to over 160 South American markets over LATAM’s hubs at Bogota Lima Santiago and Sao Paulo.

Airlines for America which represents the largest U.S. carriers said Friday it wants to know FAA’s staffing plans for the July Fourth holiday weekend “so we can plan accordingly.”

The comments from the industry group could serve as a pre-emptive defense in case airlines again suffer thousands of canceled and delayed flights over the holiday weekend when travel is expected to set new pandemic-era highs.

“The industry is actively and nimbly doing everything possible to create a positive customer experience since it is in an airline’s inherent interest to keep customers happy so they return for future business” Nicholas Calio president of the trade group said in a letter to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

Calio said airlines have dropped 15% of the flights they originally planned for June through August to make the remaining flights more reliable they are hiring and training more pilots and customer-service agents and giving passengers more flexibility to change travel plans.

Calio said air traffic is often disrupted “for many hours” because bad weather causes the the FAA to issue delays.

“However we have also observed that FAA (air traffic control) staffing challenges have led to traffic restrictions under blue sky conditions” he added.

The FAA shot back with a reference to taxpayer money that airlines received after the pandemic devastated air travel.

“People expect when they buy an airline ticket that they’ll get where they need to go safely efficiently reliably and affordably” the FAA said in a statement. “After receiving $54 billion in pandemic relief to help save the airlines from mass layoffs and bankruptcy the American people deserve to have their expectations met.”

The FAA said it has added controllers in high-traffic areas and added alternate routes to keep planes moving.

The airline trade group chief’s comments came a week after Buttigieg called airline leaders to a virtual meeting and threatened to punish carriers that fail to meet consumer-protection standards set by his department which includes the FAA.

Buttigieg said he called the meeting after being alarmed by the high number of canceled flights around Memorial Day — more than 2700 in a five-day stretch according to tracking service FlightAware.

Thunderstorms can quickly snarl air traffic during the summer but airlines have also acknowledged staffing shortages — they are hiring at a rapid pace to replace tens of thousands of workers whom the airlines paid to quit when travel collapsed in 2020. Pilot union leaders say their groups are being stretched to the limit and more pilots report being fatigued.

The FAA has admitted that it too is understaffed particularly at a key air traffic control center in Florida.

Calio said that facility near Jacksonville Florida has been understaffed for 27 of the last 30 days “which is crippling to the entire East Coast traffic flows.”

More than 600 U.S. flights had been canceled and more than 4200 delayed by early afternoon Friday according to FlightAware. That was better than Thursday however when thunderstorms on the East Coast contributed to more than 800 cancellations and 6600 delays."

Guest Columnist

Ohio just had a brush with rolling blackouts when a quarter of a million people lost power due to storm damage. Losing so much electricity at one time is always troubling. However it’s also an unfortunate preview of a similar disaster in the making.

Ohio is one of the top 10 electricity-producing states in the nation. But it’s also the fourth-largest electricity consumer. That’s a lot of power demand — and for decades it was anchored by coal-powered generating stations such as the Sammis Power Plant in eastern Ohio and the Gavin Power Plant in southern Ohio.

Like much of the nation though Ohio has seen its energy portfolio being transformed in recent years due to the rapid closure of its coal plants and an ever-greater reliance on natural gas and renewable generation. Now we’re finding out in real time that this energy transition is proving poorly managed — and is increasingly dangerous. Blackouts in California and a near collapse of the Texas grid that left hundreds dead in February 2021 are a testament.

During Ohio’s recent storms grid officials implemented rolling blackouts in order to balance and restore power across the state. The resulting lengthy outages during a scorching heatwave were a reminder of how critical a reliable supply of electricity truly is.

Twenty years ago such major power disruptions were rare in the United States. But now they’re more frequent with more than 180 serious incidents in 2020 alone.

Clearly something is amiss with America’s electric grid. And families aren’t happy. According to the North American Electricity Reliability Corporation (NERC) which oversees the nation’s supply of electricity the retirement of longstanding coal plants and a hasty attempt to remake the U.S. power grid could pose tremendous challenges to grid reliability over the next decade. Specifically NERC is warning that the Midwest faces a “high risk” of blackouts this summer.

The prospect of rolling blackouts has now become a real concern for much of the country. In fact a new national poll found that almost 80% of voters — including a majority of Democrats Republicans and Independents — want the federal government to take action.

What consumers want is common sense. And their message is simple: Don’t shut down working power plants until sufficient replacement generation is fully in place.

The same poll also found that nearly 9 in 10 voters are worried about the rising cost of electricity. That figures since Americans are now paying far more for electricity that is becoming less reliable.

Ohio must take steps to ensure reliable electricity supplies. An important place to start is to ensure the region’s existing coal capacity — which again and again has proven critical to keeping the lights on when it’s needed most — isn’t pushed off the grid when it remains a reliability backstop. We should be building the grid of tomorrow on the shoulders of energy infrastructure that we know works not scrapping it before alternatives can carry the load.

Otherwise our recent power outages could become a preview of a far more common problem — a lack of reliable electricity when Ohioans need it most. That’s not a risk worth taking.

For the past six years energy companies and Maine residents have been in a fierce stand-off over the construction of a 53-mile power line extension that would deliver 1200 megawatts of renewable hydroelectric power from Canada to Massachusetts which is enough to power approximately 1.2 million homes. For two-thirds of the distance the electricity would follow a transmission line corridor which already exists. But without the 53-mile 54-foot-wide extension the $1 billion construction project is a at an impasse. The power line has already received all of its state and federal permits. But in a state-wide vote in November Maine voters rejected the project. Now the constitutionality of that referendum vote is being battled out in court and will be decided this summer according to Anthony W. Buxton the lawyer representing the power companies that want to complete the transmission line. If the Maine court system rules that the referendum vote was unconstitutional then the energy companies involved can continue construction. Concerned citizens opposing the construction of the transmission line organized together in a group called ""Say NO to NECEC"" which is an acronym for the name of the project the New England Clean Energy Connect. The head of that opposition group is 46 year-old Sandi Howard an an 8th generation Mainer who lives in the region on her family's property. She is a professor of music at Keene State College and has led commercial whitewater and outdoor adventures for 26 years. Howard says Mainers don't trust the utility company because among other reasons Maine is one of the states suffering the worst increase in outage duration according to an Associated Press analysis of government data. Also ""Mainers want to protect its environment and way of life"" Howard told CNBC. If the power line were to be constructed ""there would be a dramatic impact to Maine's natural resources scenic character economic impact to Maine's four-season recreational tourism industry"" she said.

Also she said opponents to the project are concerned about the health of the local ecosystem. For example ""the last stronghold of native brook trout are in western Maine an area devoid of large scale infrastructure. Clearing the tree canopy for this transmission line will heat the waters in the habitat which is critical for their survival"" Howard told CNBC. But it's not just citizens like Howard who oppose the construction of the power line. Incumbent energy companies have of business on the line. In Maine alone power companies have spent collectively $94.5 million lobbying both for and against the extension through investments in political action committees according to spending data shared with CNBC by the Maine Ethics Commission an independent state agency responsible for monitoring Maine's campaign finance laws. ""This battle is the Lexington or Concord of the existential war to defeat global warming"" Buxton told CNBC. ""If fossil fuel interests can block 1200 megawatts of fully permitted renewable hydroelectricity to help New England reach zero carbon our future is hot and bleak.""

Transmission lines 'unlock' wind solar

The existing system of transmission lines is insufficient for the large-scale deployment of clean energy that the country needs to meet its decarbonization goals to combat global warming. As the battle in Maine exemplifies however building transmission lines is a complicated task which can get stuck in fierce local siting battles. A study published in June in the journal Energy Policy found 53 utility-scale wind solar and geothermal energy projects that ended up being delayed or blocked between 2008 and 2021 due local opposition. Those projects represent approximately 9586 megawatts of potential energy generation capacity. Improving transmission line infrastructure in the US would ""unlock"" the capacity the United States has for deploying renewable power says Jim Robb president of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation a not-for-profit regulatory organization that oversees the reliability of the electric grid. ""The desert southwest of the US is one of the best solar generating resources in the world and along the Midwest is one of the best wind development resources in the world"" Robb told CNBC. But the bulk of the capacity for wind and solar illustrated by the graphics embedded below are not where the majority of the American population lives.

Wind resources in the United States according to the the National Renewable Energy Laboratory a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy. National Renewable Energy Laboratory a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy.

Building transmission lines is more important for distributing renewable energy than it is for using fossil fuels because with coal natural gas or nuclear baseload energy the source of energy can be moved to where it is needed. ""With renewables you can't do that"" Robb said. ""You've got to generate power where the sun is shining and where the wind is blowing."" Insufficient transmission lines have become a major ""bottleneck"" in deploying renewable resources Robb told CNBC. ""We haven't built a major transmission line in this country in many years"" Robb told CNBC. ""And it's not because there aren't good projects identified. It's not because there aren't investors ready to fund it it is really because local siting boards don't and people don't want them running through their backyard."" Last year 386 miles of transmission were built in the U.S. according to the 2021 Clean Power Annual Market Report published by the renewable energy industry association American Clean Power. That's down markedly from the 1702 miles built in 2020. In 2013 more than 3500 miles of transmission lines were built and that was the most in the past decade. Overall 68% of the miles built in the last decade were put up between 2012 and 2016. There are companies working to scale up and commercialize long-duration energy storage in the form of batteries but even there said Robb you need transmission lines to get the renewable energy to the battery to store it. ""A battery is basically a time machine. It takes power generated at one point in time and allows you to use it at another point in time"" Robb said. If there were long-duration batteries at scale it would be ""a complete game changer for the electric grid"" but to charge those batteries with a clean decarbonized energy grid the renewable energy still has to be transported from where it is generated to where it would be stored. ""Batteries don't obviate the need for transmission but they are a very powerful complement.""

Why it's so hard to build

In the United States a single municipality and even according to some state's law a single landowner can block the construction of a transmission line Richard J. Pierce Jr. a law professor at George Washington University told CNBC. Congress needs to act to give a federal agency either the Department of Energy or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authority to site transmission lines. ""They could pass a statute that's about one page long"" Pierce told CNBC in a phone conversation at the end of May. ""This is not hard to accomplish if you've got the political will."" Pierce knows that there will be opposition to such a federal authority to which he says: Too bad. ""You cannot allow the citizens of a single state to block actions that are imperative for the welfare of the citizens that the whole country much less can you can you afford to allow the citizens of one little town or one landowner to"" Pierce said. ""It's just frustrating."" On June 16 FERC issued issued a first step — technically called a ""notice of proposed rulemaking"" — that it aims to amend laws making it easier to connect sources of electricity to the grid. The proposed changes include allowing utility generators to conduct required preliminary studies for multiple generation facilities at once instead of a separate report for each facility enforce penalties for stakeholders missing deadlines in application processes among other proposals. These proposed changes will help make it faster and easier for transmission lines to be approved where the energy source is relatively close to the electric grid but ""it does nothing to address the much bigger problem of states and localities that delay or block completely the transmission lines that are essential to allow the large sources of solar wind and hydro that are located some significant distance from the grid to reach the major markets"" Pierce told CNBC.

So what now?

President Joe Biden's infrastructure law passed in November includes $20 billion in funding lending and investment to develop the national grid ""mostly investments in strengthening the existing grid"" said Rob Gramlich founder of Grid Strategies which provides economic policy analysis on electricity transmission. ""It is not grid expansion."" To spur grid expansion the federal government should consider a tax credit for large scale transmission investment in current budget reconciliation policy discussions and the FERC proposed rule for expansion he said. Also Gramlich sees a potential path forward in upgrading existing transmission lines. There you don't have the siting battles. ""Reconstructing or replacing the old lines with new lines is a is a major opportunity"" he told CNBC. ""There's very little public opposition to transmission over existing corridors."" Another potential avenue for building transmission lines where there would be potentially less local opposition is placing them over interstate highways. ""I personally love transmission over highways"" Gramlich said. ""It's great. It's an existing corridor. People aren't so concerned about the view shed"" an industry term for the fact that people don't like to look at transmission lines. There's also the possibility of putting transmission lines underground which ""is much more economic today than it used to be"" Gramlich said. But it's still expensive as much as ten-fold the cost depending on the terrain you are trying to go through according to Robb of NERC. In some cases for example putting a transmission line means blasting through granite. So while ""that's a viable thing to do it's a very expensive thing to do"" according to Robb. As much of a ""linchpin"" transmission line infrastructure is to meeting climate goals it's an uphill battle says Steve Cicala an economics professor at Tufts University who studies energy and environmental economics ""because of all of the entrenched interests who would very much like to keep it the dysfunctional mess that it currently is."" The electric grid in the United States was stood up as a patchwork network of local energy companies that were each monopolies in their own region Cicala told CNBC. ""And the problem is that the regulatory structure hasn't caught up to recognize that we now live in a different time"" he said. That combined with people not wanting to see transmission lines in their backyard has backed stakeholders into their retrenched corner. ""At the end of the day good old fashioned incumbent interests looking to protect their bottom line the privileged positions that they have in the market Really pour gasoline and supercharge NIMBY-ism"" Cicala said. ""Someone really needs to bring these incumbent interests to heel."" That will have to come from the federal level. ""The states are just by and large hopelessly captured by the local utility interests"" Cicala said. ""Most places state governments are pretty small potatoes. And utilities are really big heavily capitalized — even if they're operating locally — they're major corporations. And most states just don't have the capacity to engage.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL29waW5pb24vZW5lcmd5LWVudmlyb25tZW50LzM1MzY0NjUtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2Fycy1hcmUtdW5hZmZvcmRhYmxlLWZvci1tYW55LWFtZXJpY2Fucy1iaWRlbi1pcy10cnlpbmctdG8taW1wb3NlLXRoZW0tYW55d2F5L9IBkwFodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL29waW5pb24vZW5lcmd5LWVudmlyb25tZW50LzM1MzY0NjUtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2Fycy1hcmUtdW5hZmZvcmRhYmxlLWZvci1tYW55LWFtZXJpY2Fucy1iaWRlbi1pcy10cnlpbmctdG8taW1wb3NlLXRoZW0tYW55d2F5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric cars are unaffordable for many Americans.

Theodore J. Kury University of Florida

Curtailment has a special meaning in electric power systems. It describes any action that reduces the amount of electricity generated to maintain the balance between supply and demand – which is critical for avoiding blackouts.

Recently curtailment has made news in states like California and Texas that are adding a lot of wind and solar power. On very windy or sunny days these sources may produce more electricity than the grid can take. So grid managers reduce production to manage that oversupply.

This can be a lost opportunity. Electricity from solar and wind as well as existing nuclear plants is inexpensive and emits less greenhouse gases than fossil fuels so it may be in society’s interest to keep these generators running.

A special kind of surplus

Consumers know about shortages and surpluses in the goods they buy. Shortages mean that shoppers can’t get that PlayStation 5 for Christmas – or more critically the bread water or baby formula they need.

Surpluses look different like unsold books classified as remainders or Easter candy discounted 80% at local drug stores on Monday morning.

But electricity is not like these goods. On today’s electric grid shortages and surpluses can both result in the exact same thing – a blackout.

The North American grid transmits electricity as alternating current that changes direction back and forth like water ebbing and flowing from a vintage hand pump as the handle is pushed up and down. Modern electricity grids require precise levels of frequency – the back-and-forth motion of power – to function properly.

The grid is designed to function at 60 hertz which means that the flow of electric current shifts back and forth 60 times per second. This is achieved in part by ensuring that the amount of electricity produced at any given time is equal to the amount of electricity being used. If too little electricity is produced frequency on the system drops. If too much electricity is produced then frequency increases.

Modern power plants are designed to operate within a relatively narrow range around 60 hertz. If the actual frequency on the grid is outside that range the plant can disconnect itself from the system. If enough plants do that it causes a blackout.

Managing the flow

In some parts of the U.S. mostly the Southeast and the West the same companies generate electricity and deliver it to customers. When power plants in a utility’s territory generate more electricity than customers are using the company will simply produce less electricity from its most expensive power plant or temporarily shut it off altogether.

But other states have restructured their electricity markets so that some companies produce power and others deliver it to customers. In these competitive markets curtailment raises complex issues. Power generators stay in business by generating and selling power so when demand drops grid operators need a system to ensure that they make curtailment decisions fairly.

Often the first tool for choosing which plants to curtail is the prices that generators are paid. When supply grows or demand falls the price of electricity falls. Some generators may decide that they are unwilling to produce electricity below a certain price and drop off if it hits that level.

If there’s still a power surplus the organization that operates the grid steps in to manually curtail generators. They can either do this through signals in the grid’s data system or by contacting generators directly through phone calls. Power may be curtailed for five minutes or five hours depending on how quickly the system returns to normal.

Overall the U.S. needs more low-emissions electricity to help reduce air pollution and slow climate change. So curtailment isn’t a sound long-term strategy for managing power surpluses. It’s somewhat comparable to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when supply chain disruptions forced producers to throw away huge quantities of food even as grocery stores struggled to fill their shelves.

One solution is to expand energy storage so that generators can save excess power for a few hours instead of sending it straight into the grid. Another option is building more transmission to carry power to areas that need it. Both types of investments can reduce the need to curtail generation and forgo making clean affordable electricity.

Some companies that stayed silent last month — when a draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to Politico — spoke up for the first time Friday including The Walt Disney Company which said it will reimburse employees who must travel out of state to get an abortion.

Facebook parent Meta American Express Bank of America and Goldman Sachs also said they would cover employee travel costs while others like Apple Starbucks Lyft and Yelp reiterated previous announcements taking similar action. Outdoor clothing maker Patagonia went so far as to post on LinkedIn Friday that it would provide “training and bail for those who peacefully protest for reproductive justice” and time off to vote.

But of the dozens of big businesses that The Associated Press reached out to Friday many like McDonald’s PepsiCo Coca-Cola General Motors Tyson and Marriott did not respond. Arkansas-based Walmart — the nation’s largest employer with a good portion of its stores in states that will immediately trigger abortion bans following the Friday’s Supreme Court ruling — also kept quiet.

Meanwhile the Business Roundtable an organization that represents some of the nation’s most powerful companies said it “does not have a position on the merits of the case.”

A lot is at stake for companies many of which have publicly pledged to promote women’s equality and advancement in the workplace. For those in states with restrictive abortion laws they could now face big challenges in attracting college-educated workers who can easily move around.

Luis von Ahn the CEO of the language app Duolingo sent a tweet Friday aimed at lawmakers in Pennsylvania where the company is headquartered: “If PA makes abortion illegal we won’t be able to attract talent and we’ll have to grow our offices elsewhere.”

The ruling and the coming patchwork of abortion bans also threatens the technology boom in places like Austin Texas as companies like Dell — which was already becoming more flexible to remote work because of the tight labor market — struggle to recruit newly minted tech graduates to their corporate hubs said Steven Pedigo a professor who studies economic development at the University of Texas at Austin.

A lot is at stake for companies many of which have publicly pledged to promote women’s equality and advancement in the workplace.

“Rather than stay in Austin do you go to New York or Seattle or the Bay Area? I think that’s a real possibility” Pedigo said. “It becomes much more challenging particularly when you’re looking at a young progressive workforce which is what technology workers tend to be.”

Emily M. Dickens chief of staff and head of government affairs for the Society for Human Resource Management said in a statement that nearly a quarter of organizations in a recent poll agreed that offering a health savings account to cover travel for reproductive care in another state will enhance their ability to compete for talent.

“But how these policies interact with state laws is unclear and employers should be aware of the legal risks involved” she said.

Dickens noted that companies that use third-party administrator to process claims on their behalf — typically big employers — are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act rather than state law. But companies that have to buy their own health insurance for their employees — typically small businesses — are subject to state regulations and have less flexibility in designing benefits.

Offering to cover travel expenses could also make companies a target for anti-abortion lawmakers. In March Texas State Representative Briscoe Cain a Republican sent a cease-and-desist letter to Citigroup saying he would propose legislation barring localities in the state from doing business with any company that provides travel benefits for employees seeking abortions.

In his concurring opinion released Friday Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested it would be unconstitutional for a state to bar residents from traveling to another state to get an abortion.

“In my view the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel” Kavanaugh wrote.

But a corporation’s right to fund what would be an illegal act in another state is still questionable argues Teresa Collett a law professor at the University of St. Thomas.

“That’s not an interstate commerce question per se” she said. “So you’d need the right plaintiff.”

Meanwhile tech companies are facing tough questions about what they’ll do if some of their millions of customers in the U.S. are prosecuted for having an abortion. Services like Apple Google Facebook and Microsoft routinely hand over digital data sought by law enforcement agencies pursuing criminal investigations. That’s raised concerns from privacy advocates about enforcers of abortion laws tapping into period apps phone location data and other sensitive online health information.

A letter Friday from four Democrats in Congress called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the phone-tracking practices of Google and Apple warning that location identifiers used for advertising could fall into the hands of prosecutors or bounty hunters looking “to hunt down women who have obtained or are seeking an abortion.”

The Supreme Court ruling comes at a time when companies have become increasingly reliant on women to fill jobs and especially as they face a nationwide labor shortage. Women now account for nearly 50% of the U.S. workforce up dramatically from 37.5% in 1970 — three years before the Supreme Court ruled abortions to be legal in Roe vs. Wade — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Denied access to abortion could hit low-income workers the hardest because they’re typically in jobs with fewer protections and that are also demanding from loading groceries onto store shelves to working as a health aide.

“As a direct result of this ruling more women will be forced to choose between paying their rent or traveling long distances to receive safe abortion care” said Mary Kay Henry international president of the Service Employees International Union which represents nearly 2 million janitors health care workers and teachers in the U.S. “Working women are already struggling in poverty-wage jobs without paid leave and many are also shouldering the caregiving responsibilities for their families typically unpaid.”

Sara Nelson president of the Association of Flight Attendants told The Associated Press that the ruling was “devastating.”

“It cuts to the core of all the work that our union has done for 75 years” she said. “This decision is not about whether or not someone supports abortion. That’s the distraction … This is about whether or not we respect the rights of women to determine their own future.”

Maurice Schweitzer a professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business said the handful of companies are taking a stand on the court’s ruling because their customers and employees are expecting them to speak out.

“We’re in this moment in time where we’re expecting corporate leaders to also be leaders in the political sphere” he said. “A lot of employees expect to work in companies that not only pay them well but whose values are aligned with theirs.”

But the vast majority of executives will likely avoid the thorny topic and focus on things like inflation or supply chain disruptions he said.

That too comes with risks.

“They can either support travel for out-of-state care and risk lawsuits and the ire of local politicians or they can not include this coverage and risk the ire of employees” Schweitzer said.

TECH FAIL American Express down with customers left unable to make payments or access accounts online or via app

HUNDREDS of American Express customers have had issues with the credit card company

Furious Amex users were left unable to login on the app or online and some could not make payments.

1 The tech problems with American Express appear not to be limited to one location

Hundreds of people reported tech issues with the credit card company according to Downdetector on Saturday morning (June 25).

One put-out customer tweeted: ""the app and portal online is down. Any updates on fix?""

Another complained: ""Is the Amex UK app down? I can't log in.""

And a third asked: ""Hi is your app down? I can’t log in with my face recognition nor with my password.""

The issue appears to have started at around 10am this morning and was not limited to one location.

Amex users in London Manchester and Belfast were among those who experienced issues.

The majority of reports cited app issues with a smaller number also experiencing online access troubles.

But some customers said they were having payment issues too.

One said: ""Seems your systems are down? Cannot login and all transactions are failing.""

Another said: ""Have you got technical issues? Payments not going through due to ‘technical problems’.""

A third person said they couldn't pay with their Amex card at wine shop Laithwaites.

We've contacted American Express for comment and will update when we hear back.

The tech problems appeared to be fixed by the early afternoon according to the outage tracking website.

Hundreds of Amex customers were hit by an outage in April which also left them unable to access the app use the website or make payments.

Can I get compensation for a credit card outage?

Unlike telecoms firms banks and credit card providers are not obliged to automatically issue compensation if they have an outage or technical problems.

You are entitled to make a complaint if you believe you have been left out of pocket because of the issues though.

For example if you have incurred a penalty fee because you were unable to make a payment or have gone overdrawn because you didn't receive money you were supposed to.

Each provider has its own complaints procedure so it's best to start there.

American Express says you should provide your name phone number and account details as well as any relevant documentation when making a complaint.

“Essence” a track from the Made in Lagos album was already a banger for Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun who is popularly known as Wizkid. But the collaboration with Tems and Bieber propelled it to another level. The remix pushed the single into the top 10 of the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The project also won the NAACP Image Award prize for the outstanding international song in February 2022.

As a result Wizkid and Tems rose in popularity and the refrain “You don’t need no other body” has become a romantic anthem.

Wizkid 31 with his distinct sultry vocals is one of the biggest stars in Africa. He was born in Lagos Nigeria and works as a songwriter who sings Afrobeat Afropop and dancehall genres according to DNB Stories Africa.

He has his own music label called Starboy Entertainment. He began his singing career at 11 recording his first song with one of Nigeria's biggest stars OJB Jezreel. After that he worked to build his career.

His breakout year was in 2009 when he was featured on ""Fast Money Fast Cars"" on M.I.’s Talk About It album drawing attention to his singing and songwriting skills according to MTV. That year he signed onto Banky W's Empire Mates Entertainment and featured prominently on Banky's ""The W Experience"" album.

By the age of 20 he released his first singles ""Holla at your Boy"" ""Gidi Girl"" and ""Ori Mi"" with label mate Skales. Since then the hits have kept coming MTV notes.

For her part Temilade Openiyi or Tems 27 a Nigerian singer songwriter and record producer burst onto the music scene in 2020 when she released her debut EP For Broken Ears. But she gained notoriety when she joined forces with Wizkid on “Essence.” Since then she has been featured on tracks with Drake and Future. In September 2021 she released her second extended play If Orange Was a Place which was produced by GuiltyBeatz.

She also released the single ""Crazy Tings"" reached number three on the UK Afrobeats Singles Chart according to NotJustOk.

Twenty-eight-year-old Bieber needs no introduction but his involvement on the single added crossover appeal of the song to pop audiences. The Canadian singer and songwriter rose to stardom in his youth after his mother posted YouTube clips of him performing according to Biography. Almost overnight Bieber went from an unknown untrained singer to a superstar with a record deal with Usher.

He became a teen idol releasing My World which hit stores in November 2009 and sold more than 137000 copies within a week the report says. In 2010 Bieber released My World 2.0 which offered his growing fan base 10 new songs. In 2011 he released Never Say Never and a holiday album Under the Mistletoe. In 2012 the album Believe sold 374000 copies in its first week.

With the success of their “Essence” collaboration Wizkid Tems and Bieber have fans waiting for the next big thing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vbGFqb2xsYW1vbS5jb20vc2FuLWRpZWdvLWFpcnBvcnQtbG91bmdlLWFpcnNwYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Aspire Lounge At San Diego International Airport T2,"Despite the fact that a number of popular local shops and restaurants have opened up inside San Diego International Airport we always stop at the Aspire lounge (formerly the Airspace lounge) before our flights out of Terminal 2.

We enjoy the quiet space as well as a quick snack or drink before take-off. Admittedly we are creatures of habit with multiple lounge memberships including American Airlines Admirals Club Priority Pass and American Express — all of which provides entry to this San Diego Airport lounge.

This lounge has gone through three transformations in the last decade and its most recent is great if you already have these memberships but I’m not sure I would pay the day rate.

What’s New at the Aspire Lounge at San Diego Airport

The Aspire Lounge replaces the Airspace Lounge which several years ago replaced San Diego Admirals Club as I mentioned earlier.

If you haven’t been into this lounge lately you might be wondering how it differs from its former life as an Airspace Lounge. Here’s the deal:

American Express Platinum and Centurion cardholders used to get a $10 credit to be put toward food and drinks. This is no longer the case. Your card grants entry and nothing else.

There’s no food menu. The only food on offer is at the self-serve buffet which is significantly larger than it used to be at Airspace. Guests used to be able to order a variety of cheese plates and sandwiches from the bar for an additional fee.

The bar menu is far more robust. You can order complimentary well cocktails and house wines. The bartender told me that any cocktail on the menu can be made with complimentary liquor instead of premium liquor.

The interior design received a refresh with newer signage new upholstery on the lounge chairs more plants and fresh coats of paint.

Less relaxed personalized service. Sure we’ve been through a high turnover a few years but it’s not the same friendly faces and they don’t confirm boarding times or gates when you check in like they used to.

Guests flying premium classes on Japan Airlines and British Airways used to be provided a special menu complimentary. I’m not sure if that’s still the case (let me know if you’ve passed through on either lately).

What It’s Like Inside the San Diego Aspire Lounge

Floor-to-ceiling windows showcase the planes outside and flood the space with light. TVs play local news and sports. And handful also display flight times.

High ceilings and compact white and muted grey furnishings make the space feel large which is good because it’s not big compared to other major airport lounges.

Upon walking in to the left is a lounge area with relatively-comfortable compact grey lounge chairs that opens up to the dining room and bar. The self-serve buffet is in between the lounge and dining/bar area. It’s basically an open floorplan.

I love how the liquor bottles line the back wall against the windows as decor. Rest assured there are plenty of electrical outlets.

Complimentary Amenities

The free WiFi is fast though not great for bulk downloading photos or heavy files.

The self-serve drink and snack area offers a breakfast selection and then transitions to an all-day selection.

The menu below is from the Swissport website. It’s a basic continental breakfast and it has been picked over the last couple of times we went. It’s fine but not deluxe by any means.

Breakfast

Complimentary: Available until 10:30 a.m. self serve

Soda

There is a coffee and cappuccino machine but it was broken during my two most recent visits in a row.

The Bar

The setup of the bar area is conducive to socializing with the bartenders and even meeting a new friend or two.

I’ve seen Airspace Lounge staff whip up some pretty impressive well-garnished drinks for customers who are keen on the bartender’s choice. It’s a friendly area.

Premium drinks for purchase include Manhattan mules Cadillac margaritas and more fun cocktails in addition to nicer wines and some of San Diego’s best local craft beers.

The list of beverages and pricing currently on the Swissport website aligns with what I have seen on the printed menu.

They used to have food and drinks for purchase. I wish they kept the Naked Juices because there really isn’t all that much for kids other than basic juice and water.

Amenities Change for Japan Airlines and British Airways (?)

If anyone has passed through the lounge having flown on these flights recently please leave a comment. I’d love to know what the menu is like after the renovation.

If you are on the direct British Airways flight to London and eligible to access the lounge there use to be a separate complimentary menu for you. It was really quite nice and includes premium wine (probably beer too but I drank the wine). British Airways’ lounges typically provide tons and tons of complimentary food and drink so this extra perk helps to meet their worldwide standards.

British Airways cheese plate and premium wine

Our once-daily Japan Airlines flight also had a separate menu. At the time of our most recent flight In the afternoon before the Japan Airlines flight leaves you’ll notice Japanese-speaking staff and snacks like instant noodle bowls as well as other Japanese goodies.

How to Access the Aspire Lounge at San Diego Airport

The Airspace Lounge is complimentary for American Admirals Club members and American Express Platinum and Centurion card holders. You can also access it using Priority Pass.

Travelers flying business class and those with elite status on British Airways or Japan Airlines that are flying the SAN-LHR or SAN-NRT routes may also use the lounge.

However anyone can also simply pay the $45 plus taxes per person walk-up fee. Military and emergency workers pay a reduced $35 plus taxes per person fee.

This is what’s included:

Additional $10 credit for premium menu items included with every entry

Unlimited complimentary soft drinks and light snacks

Full bar (premium drinks are at an additional fee)

Complimentary use of Airspace’s shower facility

Semi-private conference room (Seats up to 6)

Complimentary printing

Unlimited complimentary espresso and cappuccinos

Unlimited complimentary Peet’s Coffees & Teas

Complimentary scanning

Complimentary WiFi

Power outlets at every seat

Assistance with delays

Admission Numbers Are Capped

Note that if the lounge is at capacity staff members will display a sign outside and lock the door. In fact the door was locked (no sign – I saw them put that out later) when I tried to enter despite multiple guests inside. I only got in because another guest opened the door as he was leaving.

I don’t love this. If I have lounge memberships be it paid or from credit cards I pay hefty annual fees for I would like to get in.

I have Admirals Club AMEX Business Platinum AND Priority Pass. From what I can see there is no benefit to using one over the other.

San Diego Aspire Lounge Location in Terminal 2

After you pass through security in between American Airlines and Alaska Airlines check-in desks at Terminal 2 turn left.

You’ll see a bakery right in front of you. Head toward it and turn left.

Maybe Stop Here for Food Before the Lounge This is a Pannikin which is a San Diego institution for coffee and pastries. They also have pre-made and cooked-to-order breakfast sandwiches and avocado toast. What you find here is better than what is on offer in the Aspire lounge food-wise. So consider picking up some food here and taking it to the lounge.

If you are hungry I might suggest stopping in to grab a sandwich or a pastry to take into the lounge.

The walkway will wind to the right. The glass door to the lounge is also on the righthand side a few paces after the bend.

If you enter Terminal 2 where the international flight check-in desks and Delta Airlines are you can clear security there also and then walk toward gates 20-35. You’ll see the lounge on your way to the American and Alaska side of the terminal.

Staff members at the reception desks will check you in. Note that there are no boarding announcements so you’re on your own for tracking your boarding time.

Flight information is displayed on the TV screens as well though you could always ask staff members for updates.

Should You Use this San Diego Airport Lounge?

Is it worth paying for entry to this San Diego Airport lounge if you’re not an American Airlines Admirals Club member Priority Pass or a qualifying American Express cardholder? It depends.

If you have a long layover plan to partake in multiple cocktails that would hit the wallet otherwise or you value the comfort… the answer is yes.

San Diego International Airport offers good free WiFi everywhere so there’s no need to enter just for the WiFi.

Terminal 2 at San Diego International Airport is also now home to many of San Diego’s famous restaurants like Phil’s BBQ Stone Brewing The Prado and more.

If you’re a foodie looking for local flavor you may want to head elsewhere. The drinks are good but the food really isn’t — though it will do in a pinch.

(June 25 2022) – The U.S. Women’s National Team beat Colombia 3-0 in the first of two friendly matches in preparation for 2022 Concacaf W Championship which will serve as qualifying for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup and 2024 Olympics. A brace from forward Sophia Smith and goal in her USWNT debut from midfielder Taylor Kornieck lifted the USA past Colombia in front of an electric sold-out crowd of 17143 fans at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park.

The USA put on a dominant display in the first half posting 12 shots with three on goal but the Colombians defended with intensity while playing five in the back and dropping deep to limit the USA’s space in the attacking third. Goalkeeper Catalina Perez who moved from Bogota to Florida as a child and played college soccer at Miami and Mississippi State put in a fine performance eventually saving not one but two U.S. penalty kicks.

The team’s best chance of the half came just before the break when Smith earned a penalty kick after being brought down inside the box. Midfielder Lindsey Horan stepped up to the spot but Perez made a fine save to keep the score level.

Despite not scoring in the first half the USA showed patience and maturity while continuing to create opportunities. The USA controlled the match even more in the final 45 minutes and shortly after substitute midfielder Ashley Sanchez who made a difference after coming on at halftime clipped a chipped shot off the top of the crossbar in the 50th minute the USA finally got the opening goal in the 54th. Midfielder Rose Lavelle sent a long pass into the path of the streaking Smith who was running into the box on the left side. Smith beat Perez to the ball before stuffing it between her legs and into the net as she collided with the goalkeeper and a sliding defender.

Just six minutes later Lavelle and Smith connected again to double the lead in a similar fashion as Lavelle forced a turnover near midfield and played another long ball behind the defense and into Smith’s path. She controlled the ball well and deftly finished from 13 yards out for her second goal of the night.

Nine minutes later the USA had a chance to score a third after forward Alex Morgan who had come into the match as a halftime substitute was fouled inside the box making way for Lavelle to step up to the penalty spot. She hit her shot well but Perez was up for the challenge yet again as she once again turned the ball away.

Morgan’s was one of a handful of notable substitutions on the night as she and fellow veteran Megan Rapinoe saw their first international action since October of 2021. Kornieck who attended college at the University of Colorado made her international debut after coming into the match in the 73rd minute. In the dying moments of the game she became the 22nd player in USWNT history to score in her first appearance after finishing a header off a set-piece service from Rapinoe much to the delight of the Colorado crowd. At 6-foot-1 Kornieck also became the tallest field player ever to appear for the USA and the 248th woman to earn a USWNT cap.

The USA will close out its two-game set with Colombia on Tuesday June 28 in Sandy Utah. The teams will meet at Rio Tinto Stadium home of Major League Soccer’s Real Salt Lake with kickoff slated for 10 p.m. ET / 8 p.m. MT on ESPN.

GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN:

USA – Sophia Smith (Rose Lavelle) 54th minute – Lavelle collected the ball at midfield and played a perfectly weighted through-ball into space to meet Smith on the run into the left side of the penalty area. She shot from 19 yards out on the slide and nutmegged the goalkeeper to open the scoring. USA 1 COL 0

USA – Sophia Smith (Rose Lavelle) 60th minute – Lavelle stole the ball from a Colombian player near midfield and played another fantastic pass this one diangonally to Smith running into the right side of the penalty area. She took a touch and bent a left-footed shot from 13 yards out into the lower left corner to double the lead. USA 2 COL 0

USA – Taylor Kornieck (Megan Rapinoe) 90+1 minute – Rapinoe sent a cross in on a set piece from th left side. Kornieck run under it and redirected the ball with a flicked header just inside the right post for her first career goal. USA 3 COL 0

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

Sophia Smith’s goals marked her fourth and fifth in 2022 upped her career total to six and were her first goals for the USWNT in her home state of Colorado.

Smith’s brace marked her second career multi-goal game and her first since her hat trick vs Uzbekistan on April 9. She is now tied for the team-lead in scoring with five goals on the year.

With her two assists midfielder Rose Lavelle has now been directly involved in seven goals in her last three games for the USA (two goals five assists).

After coming into the match as a halftime substitute forward Alex Morgan made her first USWNT appearance since October 26 2021 vs. Korea Republic.

“That means looking at fair living wages targeted local hiring strong health and safety protections and agreements that make sure workers have a voice on the job. So we have given them about nine points that we would like to see implemented across all of the host cities. Because one of the things we have found is the cities haven’t gotten guidance about what the expectations are” said Cathy Feingold director of the international department at the AFL-CIO. “And so we think the best way to handle this is to make sure there are very clear binding frameworks that unify all of the host cities.”

FIFA did not respond to a request for comment.

This year’s World Cup starts in November. Critics say the first World Cup in the Middle East is problematic because of Qatar’s history of human and labor rights abuses. There have been widespread reports of abuse of the migrant workers who have built the estimated $200 billion in projects that include stadiums transport and other infrastructure.

Qatari officials and FIFA have said the World Cup has accelerated positive changes in the nation’s laws and society. And indeed the nation has introduced a minimum wage and dismantled the “kafala” sponsorship system binding workers to their employer.

The U.S. Canada and Mexico bid for the World Cup included a 90-page plan to address human rights. Some of the groups in Dignity 2026 were involved in the plan’s formulation.

“We know very well that what’s on paper doesn’t always mean what’s put into practice. And so what we’ve come together to do is really translate that document that at this point is non-binding and make sure its implemented in the host cities” Feingold said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIyL2p1bi8yNS9yb2Utdi13YWRlLWFib3J0aW9uLWNocmlzdGlhbi1yaWdodC1hbWVyaWNh0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMjIvanVuLzI1L3JvZS12LXdhZGUtYWJvcnRpb24tY2hyaXN0aWFuLXJpZ2h0LWFtZXJpY2E?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the Christian right took over the judiciary and changed America,"The supreme court decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization which reverses the constitutional abortion rights that American women have enjoyed over the past 50 years has come as a surprise to many voters. A majority after all support reproductive rights and regard their abolition as regressive and barbaric.

Understood in the context of the movement that created the supreme court in its current incarnation however there is nothing surprising about it. In fact it marks the beginning rather than the endpoint of the agenda this movement has in mind.

At the core of the Dobbs decision lies the conviction that the power of government can and should be used to impose a certain moral and religious vision – a supposedly biblical and regressive understanding of the Christian religion – on the population at large.

How did this conviction come to have such influence in the courts given America’s longstanding principle of church-state separation? To understand why this is happening now it’s important to know something about the Christian nationalist movement’s history how its leaders chose the issue of abortion as a means of creating single-issue voters and how they united conservatives across denominational barriers by in effect inventing a new form of intensely political religion.

Christian nationalists often claim their movement got its start as a grassroots reaction to Roe v Wade in 1973. But the movement actually gelled several years later with a crucial assist from a group calling itself the “New Right”.

Paul Weyrich Howard Phillips Phyllis Schlafly and other leaders of this movement were dissatisfied with the direction of the Republican party and the culture at large. “We are radicals who want to change the existing power structure. We are not conservatives in the sense that conservative means accepting the status quo” Paul Weyrich said. “We want change – we are the forces of change.”

They were angry at liberals who they believed threatened to undermine national security with their softness on communism. They were angry at establishment conservatives – the “Rockefeller Republicans” – for siding with the liberals; they were angry about the rising tide of feminism which they saw as a menace to the social order and about the civil rights movement and the danger it posed to segregation. One thing that they were not particularly angry about at least initially was the matter of abortion rights.

New Right leaders formed common cause with a handful of conservative Catholics including George Weigel and Richard John Neuhaus who shared their concerns and drew in powerful conservative preachers such as Jerry Falwell and Bob Jones Sr. They were determined to ignite a hyper-conservative counter-revolution. All they needed now was an issue that could be used to unify its disparate elements and draw in the rank and file.

Among their core concerns was the fear that the supreme court might end tax exemptions for segregated Christian schools. Jerry Falwell and many of his fellow southern white conservative pastors were closely involved with segregated schools and universities – Jones went so far as to call segregation “God’s established order” and referred to desegregationists as “Satanic propagandists” who were “leading colored Christians astray”. As far as these pastors were concerned they had the right not just to separate people on the basis of race but to also receive federal money for the purpose.

They knew however that “Stop the tax on segregation!” wasn’t going to be an effective rallying cry for their new movement. As the historian and author Randall Balmer wrote “It wasn’t until 1979 – a full six years after Roe – that evangelical leaders at the behest of conservative activist Paul Weyrich seized on abortion not for moral reasons but as a rallying-cry to deny President Jimmy Carter a second term. Why? Because the anti-abortion crusade was more palatable than the religious right’s real motive: protecting segregated schools.”

In many respects abortion was an unlikely choice because when the Roe v Wade decision was issued most Protestant Republicans supported it. The Southern Baptist Convention passed resolutions in 1971 and 1974 expressing support for the liberalization of abortion law and an editorial in their wire service hailed the passage of Roe v Wade declaring that “religious liberty human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision.” As governor of California Ronald Reagan passed the most liberal abortion law in the country in 1967. Conservative icon Barry Goldwater supported abortion law liberalization too at least early in his career and his wife Peggy was a cofounder of Planned Parenthood in Arizona.

Yet abortion turned out to be the critical unifying issue for two fundamentally political reasons. First it brought together conservative Catholics who supplied much of the intellectual leadership of the movement with conservative Protestants and evangelicals. Second by tying abortion to the perceived social ills of the age – the sexual revolution the civil rights movement and women’s liberation – the issue became a focal point for the anxieties about social change welling up from the base.

Over time pro-choice voices were purged from the Republican party. In her 2016 book How the Republican Party Became Pro-Life Phyllis Schlafly details the considerable effort it took over several decades to force the Republican party to change its views on the issue. What her book and the history shows is that the “pro-life religion” that we see today which cuts across denominational boundaries on the political right is a modern creation.

In recent decades the religious right has invested many hundreds of millions of dollars developing a complex and coordinated infrastructure whose features include rightwing policy groups networking organizations data initiatives and media. A critical component of this infrastructure is its sophisticated legal sphere.

Movement leaders understood very well that if you can capture the courts you can change society. Leading organizations include the Alliance Defending Freedom which is involved in many of the recent cases intended to degrade the principle of church-state separation; First Liberty; Becket formerly known as the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty; and the Federalist Society a networking and support organization for rightwing jurists and their allies whose leader Leonard Leo has directed hundreds of millions of dollars to a network of affiliated organizations. This infrastructure has created a pipeline to funnel ideologues to important judicial positions at the national and federal level. Nearly 90% of Trump’s appellate court nominees were or are Federalist Society members according to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and all six conservative justices on the supreme court are current or former members.

The rightwing legal movement has spent several decades establishing a new regime in which “religious liberty” is reframed as an exemption from the law one enjoyed by a certain preferred category of religion. LGBT advocacy groups are concerned that the supreme court’s willingness in the next session to hear the case of a Colorado website designer who wishes to refuse services to same-sex couples is a critical step to overturning a broad range of anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT Americans along with women members of religious minority groups and others.

The legal powerhouses of the Christian right have also recognized that their efforts can be turned into a gravy train of public money. That is one of the reasons a recent supreme court decision which ruled Maine must fund religious schools as part of a state tuition program was predicted by observers of this movement. This decision forces the state to fund religious schools no matter how discriminatory their practices and sectarian their teachings. “This court continues to dismantle the wall of separation between church and state” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.

This supreme court has already made clear how swiftly our Christian nationalist judiciary will change the law to suit this vision of a society ruled by a reactionary elite a society with a preferred religion and a prescribed code of sexual behavior all backed by the coercive power of the state. The idea that they will stop with overturning Roe v Wade is a delusion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC11cy1jYW5hZGEtNjE5MzgxMDnSATVodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQtdXMtY2FuYWRhLTYxOTM4MTA5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joe Biden signs into law landmark gun control bill,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMjUvdXN3bnQtc29waGlhLXNtaXRoLWphZWxpbi1ob3dlbGwtY29sb3JhZG8v0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVudmVycG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8yNS91c3dudC1zb3BoaWEtc21pdGgtamFlbGluLWhvd2VsbC1jb2xvcmFkby9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Kindergarten to the U.S. Women’s National Team two Colorado soccer players grew up together on the pitch,"Sophia Smith and Jaelin Howell met in kindergarten where their relationship started with a squabble over who was sleeping on whose carpet square at nap time.

The versions of the story vary between Howell and Smith who are teammates on the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team disputing who stole whose spot on the floor.

“We tell this story different and we think it’s funny” Howell said.

That rivalry over a suitable napping place dissolved when the two ended up on the same youth soccer team — the Tinmath Twisters. Smith and Howell grew up playing together at Real Colorado — an elite club team based in Centennial — and were invited to play for U.S. soccer when they were just 13 and 14 years old respectively. Today they are teammates on the U.S. National Women’s Soccer Team and will be on the roster Saturday when the team plays a friendly match against Colombia at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park.

The duo are two of four women from Colorado on the national team — an impressive number for a state the size of Colorado. It’s even rarer to have two women who’ve played together since they were little girls make it to such a big stage.

“It’s been awesome. You don’t hear about something like that happening very often if ever” Smith said. “It’s definitely a cool story. And it’s cool to go through this process together because it’s a unique process and it’s hard.”

Smith 21 already has been named to the roster for next month’s World Cup and Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico. Golden’s Lindsey Horan 28 and Mallory Pugh of Highlands Ranch also have earned spots in the lineup. Howell however has not been tabbed to play in the upcoming tournament in Mexico but was invited to train and play this month’s warmup matches with the team.

The U.S. women’s coach Vlatko Andonovski sees Howell 22 as part of the team’s bright future. And if players ahead of Howell are lost to injury she could work her way onto the roster.

Smith and Howell honed their soccer skills on youth teams in northern Colorado. They signed on with Real Colorado when their parents recognized their immense potential. There they shared a dream to one day be a part of the national team where they would play for World Cup trophies and Olympic gold medals.

Lorne Donaldson their coach at Real Colorado smiles when he thinks of his star players. Pugh 24 also played for Real Colorado.

“As a club we are very very very proud of them” he said. “Words cannot describe it. ”

Smith is a relentless player with big ambitions to be the best Donaldson said.

“I always tell her if she plays against her mom she would still try to score 10 goals” he said.

Smith still bristles over a game where Donaldson benched her after she scored seven goals in the first half. He thought it was bad sportsmanship to leave her in and worried about her getting injured especially if the other team got upset over her prolific scoring.

“She said ‘They can’t catch me to hurt me'” Donaldson said.

Howell is known as a tough defender who also finds ways to score Donaldson said. He was watching in April when Howell scored her first goal in an international game against Uzbekistan. Pugh had fired off a corner kick and the ball bounced between players until Howell booted it into the goal.

“Jaelin finished it as they would say” Donaldson said. “She’s not a scorer. She would say it too.”

Neither Smith or Howell played on their high school soccer teams past their freshman year choosing instead to focus on their club team to get attention from colleges and national team coaches. The two first were invited to the USA U-14 training camp when they were teens. Since then they’ve been invited back to various national team training camps and tournaments. When Howell was 17 and Smith was 16 they were called up to train with the national team.

“All of our firsts have always been together” Howell said.

How it started: How it’s going: pic.twitter.com/t2AZGIiJJV — U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) December 1 2020

The two remember how amazed they were to be playing with their childhood heroes — Carly Lloyd and Alex Morgan. They laugh about sitting around the lunch table talking about prom while those long-time stars discussed buying homes and getting married.

They never played on opposite teams until they went to college.

After high school Smith went to Stanford and played two years before leaving college to turn pro. In 2020 she was the No. 1 overall draft pick in the National Women’s Soccer League. She now plays forward for the Portland Thorns FC.

Howell played four years at Florida State and twice won the Hermann Trophy which is considered the Heisman Trophy for college women’s soccer. She was chosen second overall in the 2022 draft as a midfielder by Racing Louisville FC.

On Saturday they’ll be on the field together again wearing red white and blue and cheering each other on.

“I’ve always said having Soph helped my career so much” Howell said. “We were going through the same things at the same time.”"

KEY HIGHLIGHTS Erika LaBrie is the woman who famously ""married"" the Eiffel Tower in a commitment ceremony in 2007.

She cites the shape and geometry of the chiselled red barrier as the reason she is physically attracted to the fence.

Erika Eiffel was also seen talking to fence as she called it ""sweet"".

Erika LaBrie an American woman who famously has romantic feelings for inanimate objects gave a whole new meaning to “sitting on the fence”—the popular expression for indecision—when she revealed she is attracted to a fence.

LaBrie 50 who is a competitive archer and a crusader of object sexuality was recently seen in a now-viral video straddling a red fence as she lets the viewers in on the love she experiences for the chiselled structure.

“I did not expect to find a fence like this here at all” the former pilot can be heard saying. “He (fence) is perfect I mean this is the shape that I like so much. These angles? Fabulous” she goes on.

Popularly known as Erika Eiffel the woman identifies as an objectum sexual—a term that describes a person who is romantically or sexually attracted to inanimate objects

The viral TikTok clip is a snippet from a TLC documentary about objectophilia and features her explaining what draws her to the fence as she cops a feel.

“Fences are such dangerous objects for me because they are so perfect in their geometry” says LaBrie. “I’m definitely physically attracted to this fence and I would like to get to know this fence better” she adds.

Their connection is not merely physical as the woman even appears to talk to the fence going as far as to call it “sweet”.

Erika LaBrie caught global attention in 2007 after she “married” the Eiffel Tower in what has been described as a commitment ceremony that took place in Paris France.

Subsequently the woman changed her surname to “Eiffel” and likes to go by her new name.

Stocks across Wall Street have been hammered into a bear market this year but those of companies that derive the bulk of their sales outside of the US have trailed those of companies that are domestically oriented Goldman Sachs said this week.

The slump in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite has pushed the major indexes down by more than 20% in 2022 with the tech-rich Nasdaq sitting on a loss of 26%.

Analysis from Goldman Sachs published Friday showed the pain of stock losses has been particularly sharp for companies with a heavy amount of international sales. The investment bank said a basket of stocks it tracks with high domestic sales exposure has outperformed a basket of multinational stocks by nine percentage points this year.

That leaves the international basket down by 24% wider than the 15% decline in the domestic bunch. Goldman's international sales and domestic sales baskets each hold 50 S&P 500 stocks with the greatest share of non-US and domestic revenues.

Foreign sales in 2021 accounted for 29% of the $14 trillion of aggregate S&P 500 revenues compared with 28% in 2020.

What's helped provide upside support for US-focused companies is the climb in the trade-weighted US dollar's value Goldman said.

The US Dollar Index which measures the greenback's performance against six other currencies this year has soared to fresh 20-year highs above the 105 level. But dollar strength can hurt multinational companies in part as it makes their products more expensive for holders of other currencies to purchase.

What's also put pressure on the multinationals basket is the Information Technology sector as it rakes in 59% of its revenue from overseas. Tech stocks have plunged as the climb in interest rates can lead to chipped prospects for future profit. The materials sector is the only other one that makes most of its revenue from overseas at 50%.

The largest region of non-US exposure was Asia Pacific at 9% or $1 trillion followed by Europe at 6% or $846 billion. But only 3% or $370 billion of S&P 500 revenues were explicitly from Greater China said Goldman which conducted its analysis on recent 10-K annual corporate filings.

On a regional basis it said Monolithic Power Qualcomm and Las Vegas Sands were the companies with the largest revenue exposure to Greater China. In Greater Europe the list was topped by travel services company Bookings and gold miner Newmont.

The Star Tribune reported that U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson in St. Paul Minn. issued a written decision earlier this month. The judge said Dairy Queen failed to prove W.B. Mason Co. committed any infringement.

Dairy Queen has dubbed its soft-serve ice cream treats Blizzards and has held trademarks on the name since 1946.

W.B. Mason Co. which sells some food and beverage items launched a line of copy paper dubbed Blizzard in 2003 and attached the name to its bottled spring water in 2010 according to court documents. Dairy Queen’s lawsuit demanded the company remove the Blizzard water from store shelves and sought unspecified damages.

W.B. Mason Co.’s attorneys argued that Dairy Queen only became aware of Blizzard spring water in 2017 and couldn’t show even one instance of confusion after nearly 190 million sales of the bottled water.

Toyota recalls electric car for wheel that may detach

Toyota is recalling 2700 bZ4X crossover vehicles globally for wheel bolts that could become loose in a major setback for the Japanese automaker’s ambitions to roll out electric cars.

Toyota Motor Corp. said the cause is still under investigation but the whole wheel could come off risking a crash.

“Until the remedy is available no one should drive these vehicles” the company said in a statement.

Among the vehicles subject to the latest recall about 2200 were destined for Europe 270 for North America 112 for Japan and 60 for the rest of Asia according to Toyota. They were produced between March and June.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL3Nwb3J0L3Rlbm5pcy81NjMyMTU2L2VtbWEtcmFkdWNhbnUtc3BvbnNvcnMtbmlrZS1icml0aXNoLWFpcndheXMtdXMtb3Blbi13aW1ibGVkb24v0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vc3BvcnQvdGVubmlzLzU2MzIxNTYvZW1tYS1yYWR1Y2FudS1zcG9uc29ycy1uaWtlLWJyaXRpc2gtYWlyd2F5cy11cy1vcGVuLXdpbWJsZWRvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emma Raducanu’s full list of sponsors worth $10m after US Open win turned her world upside down...,"NET GAINS Emma Raducanu’s full list of sponsors worth $10m after US Open win turned her world upside down

EMMA RADUCANU's life turned upside down when she won the US Open in New York last year.

The 19-year-old is now a global household name with 2.4million Instagram followers and a net worth of a whopping $12m.

12 Emma Raducanu's US Open win changed her life forever - and her bank balance too

12 She has landed herself a whole host of whopping deals with various brands

Some even predict the London ace will become the first $1billion female athlete as a marketer’s dream model and representative.

Around a fifth of her current value $2.2m came as prize money following her heroic Flushing Meadows run not dropping a set in her ten matches.

A further $222k was from her breakthrough Wimbledon venture that captured the heart of the nation.

But the majority rolled in the wake of that win.

The megabucks at least $10m came rolling in as Raducanu 19 signed sponsorship deals with a whole host of massive brands - from car manufacturers to luxury jewellers.

SunSport rounds up the tennis sensation’s list of incredible deals…

Nike - $125000

One of the sponsors already in place was sportswear giant Nike who beat off rivals and picked Rads up before she burst on to the scene at Wimbledon last year.

It means the teenager wears their clothes trainers and accessories on and off the court.

12 She burst on to the scene at Wimbledon 2021 decked out head to toe in Nike gear

Their deal is worth around $125000 per year and is on a rolling contract so that will likely continue to rise in the seasons to come.

Wilson - $125000

Similarly to Nike Wilson had Raducanu on their books early.

It is understood their arrangement with the tennis star is pretty much the same as Nike’s too - with Raducanu using a Wilson racket and earning about $125000 doing so.

12 The British tennis sensation plays with a Wilson Steam - disguised as the new Blade V8

But although she appears to use the “copper green” Blade V8 the Brit actually plays with a Wilson Steam 100 a discontinued model which gets spray painted to look like the Blade.

Tiffany & Co - $2.5m

Raducanu’s first major sponsorship came just days after her US Open triumph as she was confirmed as a house ambassador for Tiffany & Co - and therefore a colleague of Beyonce.

12 The Tiffany & Co deal guarantees her $2.5m and endless designer jewellery

She had already been wearing some of their beautiful jewellery including on the court in New York before the announcement was made.

And now she will barely be spotted without the earrings necklaces rings and bracelets that help her pocket a whopping $2.5m.

Dior - $2.5m

A second fashion commercial sponsorship a second deal worth $2.5m for the superstar.

The fashion label wasted No Time in tying Raducanu down - kitting her out in one of their statement pieces for the James Bond No Time To Die premiere.

Raducanu told Vogue: “Being able to wear a dress like that made with all the magic in the Dior ateliers was a totally unique experience.

12 Raducanu stunned in her debut Dior outing at the No Time To Die premiere

""The detailed embroidery was exceptional and I was so honoured to attend my first movie premiere in it.”

She will model Dior creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri’s womenswear collections and also endorse their make-up and skincare ranges.

Evian - Unknown

All of these agreements and contracts is thirsty work.

Thankfully drinking water company came calling with an offer to make Raducanu a global brand ambassador - although the fees have not been revealed.

12 Evian water scooped the teenager at the end of 2021

It was a wise move from Evian as they also provide all the water bottles for the Wimbledon Championships each summer.

Their first photoshoot saw Rads pictured in her Wimbledon whites in a pink changing room before she dazzled at Evian’s launch of their sparkling water in February.

And then the teenage superstar teamed up with Dua Lipa and gave the singer some quick tips on how to improve her tennis.

British Airways - $1.2m

It was no wonder the airline giant decided to snap up the world’s highest-flying star in December.

12 Raducanu celebrated becoming British Airway's newest global ambassador in style

Raducanu can forget converting her massive career earnings into Avios points because she can catch a flight wherever and whenever as BA’s global ambassador - a fitting title for the Canada-born daughter of a Romanian and Chinese who grew up in South London.

Reports suggest the deal is worth a seven-figure sum - and therefore could be well in excess of $1.2m.

Sports Direct - Unknown

Rads featured alongside a whole host of sporting heroes in Sports Direct’s all-star cast for their Christmas advert.

The retailers spent a whopping $7.3m on the commercial overall with Raducanu getting a slice of that.

12 She dug out her tennis kit to feature in the Sports Direct Christmas ad

Declan Rice Jordan Pickford Dominic Calvert-Lewin Mason Mount Fran Kirby Jessica Ennis-Hill Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Maro Itoje were also part of the video clip.

Raducanu’s role - decked out in her dress and visor - saw her duck behind car in the driving snow asking for “new balls please” then ping a trademark serve into the back of Jack Grealish.

Vodafone - $3.7m

Raducanu added the mobile network as the latest string to her impressive bow of sponsorships in March.

The 19-year-old was signed as their grassroots ambassador to try and inspire the next generation of tennis heroes.

12 The Brit is said to earn $3.7m as the grassroots rep for mobile network Vodafone

Part of the deal sees her promote the Play Your Way to Wimbledon tournament which gives junior talents across the country the chance to take to the famous lawns of the All England Club.

She said: ""The support I received at a grassroots level has been key to my development as a player and I’m looking forward to helping make these initiatives even bigger better and more accessible.""

Porsche - Unknown

Then comes the deal that matters most to petrol-head Raducanu.

She grew up go-karting and riding in motocross - and retains her passion for all engines on wheels racing around tracks in MotoGP and Formula One.

So now her huge contract as a Porsche ambassador not only banks her extra cash but gives her access to their “iconic” motors.

And she clearly loved every second of this unveiling shoot getting to pose with a $160k 911 GT3 and a classic 911 Carrera 3.2 - then was gifted her very own car to take home.

12 Rads undoubtedly enjoyed her photoshoot with Porsche

Raducanu - who also still drives a Dacia Sandero - beamed: “For me to a brand ambassador for Porsche means a lot. Porsche is one of the brands I’ve always loved from a young age.

“One of my first tennis coaches drove a 911. Whenever I would turn up to practice in the morning I would see his Porsche I would go ‘wow’ and be dreaming of one day sitting in my own.

“My favourite car is the 911 for sure. Throughout the generations it’s so unique and beautiful in every way. I feel like it’s one of the most iconic cars out there.”

HSBC - Unknown

Last but by no means least and just in time for Wimbledon Raducanu cashed in on a partnership with the Championships' official banking partner.

Her deal with HSBC runs for four years and includes helping to educate young people on money.

It has extra personal interest too with both of her parents working in the financial sector.

She said: ""To partner with HSBC is so natural for me having grown up playing in the HSBC Road to Wimbledon and having been a customer for many years.

""If I wasn't a tennis player I would definitely want to work in finance so I'm excited to learn more about the industry in the years to come. We are working on some really cool ideas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaXBzbmV3cy5uZXQvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wNi8yNS9waHlzaW8tb21lZ2EtcmV2aWV3cy1waHlzaW90cnUtaXMtaXQtc2NhbS1tdXN0LXJlYWQv0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly9pcHNuZXdzLm5ldC9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA2LzI1L3BoeXNpby1vbWVnYS1yZXZpZXdzLXBoeXNpb3RydS1pcy1pdC1zY2FtLW11c3QtcmVhZC8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Physio Omega Reviews PhysioTru – Is It Scam?

Price $67 per bottle Where to Buy Physio Omega Official Website >> Refund Policy Money Back Guarantee for 60 days.

What Is Physio Omega?

Physio Omega is a triple Omega fish oil supplement developed by PhysioTru. But it is more than just a mediocre fish oil supplement because it contains a particular type of Omega the DPA along with EPA and DPH.

It is a complete blend of Omega fatty acids and developed into easy-to-swallow soft-gel capsules for maximum absorption and to provide heart health benefits. Physio Omega is all-natural and the Omegas are sourced from Menhaden fish wild-caught in clean American water.

What makes Physio Omega special than most of the CoQ10 and fish oil supplements is that it contains EPA DHA and the missing type of Omega called the DPA. The DPA is a specific type of Omega that researchers found to be most beneficial for heart health.

If you want to improve your heart and reduce the chances of heart disease you may choose the Physio Omega supplement. You only need to take two Physio Omega capsules in the morning and maintain your health – especially heart health. People with high triglycerides also opt for this specially formulated Omega supplement.

Physio Omega Benefits

Physio Omega is primarily a nutritional supplement that enhances your well-being from the inside. It also prevents inflammation and ailments and promotes the general fitness of your body.

In this section of the Physio Omega review we’ll discuss what is Physio Omega good for and the benefits that you can achieve.

Physio Omega supplements can help fight conditions like heart disease high cholesterol and anxiety; they also lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation. Some of the Physio Omega reviews also claim that it can help manage and prevent chronic inflammatory diseases.

This fish oil formula can also aid joint pain and mobility. But the best benefit is that the supplement is really safe and there is no known negative side effect.

In short Physio Omega may help to:

Improve heart health.

Lower blood pressure and reduce triglycerides.

Promote healthier blood sugar.

Reduce the chances of heart attack stroke and other heart diseases.

How Does Physio Omega Work?

Physio Omega works by providing your body with essential nutrients and three types of Omega-3. Unlike cheap fish oil supplements that are formulated with ethyl ester Physio Omega is formulated in triglyceride form for maximum absorption.

Along with EPA and DHA Omegas Physio Omega also contains docosapentaenoic acid (DPA). Researchers found DPA is a special type of Omega-3 that is most beneficial for improving lipid metabolism heart health and also brain health.

Physio Omega with DPA works by regulating inflammation and protecting heart health from the formation of artery clots and heart attacks. A Japanese study also discovered that DPA is 10x more effective than DHA and EPA! Also Physio Omega helps reduce harmful triglyceride levels which leads to decreased risk of heart attacks and strokes. Thus it is not just a mediocre type of fish oil supplement.

By taking the Physio Omega supplements you’ll also notice an increase in your energy just within the first two to three days of consumption. And Dr. Sam Walters the formulator of Physio Omega guarantees that you’ll start experiencing the maximum heart health benefits after three to four weeks.

The Physio Omega Ingredients

Each serving of Physio Omega contains 2400 mg of fish oil 240 mg of DHA 280 mg of EPA and 60 mg of DHA. Here’s the list of ingredients of Physio Omega:

Menhaden Fish Oil

Omega 3 Fatty Acid

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)

Docosapentaenoic acid (DPA)

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)

Additional ingredients: Mixed Tocopherols and Citrus Flavor.

Physio Omega Side Effects

Many of our customers say taking Physio Omega daily gives them energy normal cholesterol and heart health sharpened focus and memory and better cognitive function without the side effects of some other fish oil supplements. But is Physio Omega safe?

First of all it is important to note that the Amerian Heart Association (AHA) recommends that supplementing with 3 grams of fish oil a day is safe. Each serving of Physio Omega contains 2400 mg of Menhaden Fish Oil which is safe.

But please be cautious of using it if you are allergic to fish. The manufacturer and the formulator of Physio Omega Dr. Sam Walters guarantees that the product contains the purest form of Omega-3 and is sourced only from Menhaden fish. It is safe but we advise you to use the product as per the recommended dosage.

How To Take Physio Omega

The website and the Physio Omega label recommend taking only two capsules every day in the morning. If you’re new to Physio Omega take a few days to see how your body responds to it.

Then gradually start increasing your dosage every week – this will allow you to identify your required “optimal” dose personally. It is also important to follow some protocols when using the Physio Omega supplement and to avoid the risks of heart disease.

The Mayo Clinic and Harvard health suggest it is best to avoid processed turkey bacon as it poses diabetes and heart disease risks. Also consider switching to grass-fed butter other than margarine for your heart health. It is also best to avoid vegetable oil leading to cell damage and inflammation. Consider substituting vegetable oil with coconut oil.

“This is Michael from Omega Physio Newcastle and it has been three weeks that I have been taking Physio Omega pills. Physio-Omega has been an effective product for me. As I am currently using this my blood pressure is now staying around normal for me and I seem to have more energy. I am on a low-salt diet so it is very important for me to bear the Physio-Omega regularly. The pills go down very easily and my stomach seems to like them. They are not huge pills so if you have trouble swallowing regular pills they should be fine.” Michael.

“I have been taking Physio Omega for three weeks now and I can definitely feel a difference! I am 48 years old and can honestly say that this is the best fish oil supplement I have ever tried. I am not an athlete and don’t work out regularly but this has really given me more energy. The taste is fantastic too. It is not fishy at all; just your average lemon flavor like you are drinking Gatorade or something.” Anonymous.

Sunday more than 100000 people gathered on Hennepin Avenue to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the event. They were embraced by some of Minnesota's largest employers as well as a group of Democratic heavyweights who welcomed the crowds with a plea for political action in response to recent moves that they said threaten the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community.

Several pre-parade speakers denounced the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade noting that Justice Clarence Thomas proclaimed that the legal rationale for banning abortion should be used to overturn cases establishing rights to contraception same-sex consensual relations and same-sex marriage. The speakers urged attendees to get out and vote this fall for people who support their causes.

""They are coming for equality"" said Gov. Tim Walz who also marched in the parade next to Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan. ""They are coming for all of our rights. The good news is there's more of us. … The antidote to what we saw on Friday is you. It is all of our responsibility to create a world where every single child is seen heard loved and valued. Minnesota is that place.""

Andrea Jenkins president of the Minneapolis City Council warned the crowd that more than 300 anti-LGBTQ laws have been introduced throughout the U.S. recently with more than 100 of them passing in various states. She said conservatives are trying to legislate the LGBTQ community ""out of societal existence.""

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said the LGBTQ community has shown that it has political muscle of its own.

""Fifty years ago did we think we were going to have gay marriage? We did not"" Klobuchar told the crowd. ""Did we think we were going to get rid of things like 'Don't ask don't tell'? We did not. We have made so much progress. … This is a celebration of 50 years of progress but it is also a call for action for 50 more.""

Many crowd members said they welcomed the intrusion of politics on a day devoted to spreading messages of love inclusion and acceptance.

Pam Burd who has been coming to the Pride parade for 20 years said it was important for state leaders to show support for the LGBTQ community.

""I'm pretty disturbed by recent events"" said Burd who identifies as a gay woman. ""And I don't know what our future is. So I think our leaders need to be involved in everything that's going on.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was the most energetic politician on hand jogging down the route in shorts and pumping up the crowd outside Rock Bottom Brewery. In a call-and-responses session Frey shouted ""Happy!"" and the jubilant crowd shouted back ""Pride!""

Same-sex couples exchanged kisses and hugs sometimes on the route itself. The Timberwolves mascot drew huge cheers with his dance routine to Aretha Franklin's ""Respect."" The crowd also went delirious for bubbles and people sang along to a variety of hits.

""It was awesome"" said Tasia Desjarlait who brought her four kids to the parade for the first time. ""I feel great because the people going to the parade today feel free.""

Police said turnout was as large as before the pandemic. They reported no arrests or incidents related to the parade though a group of about 100 anti-police protesters briefly disrupted the beginning of the parade as they chanted ""No police at Pride"" and ""No justice no peace."" The group quickly moved to Loring Park organizers said.

The parade was an entertaining spectacle that lasted slightly more than two hours. Though it did not reach Mardi Gras levels there was a lot of exposed skin even though the weather never topped 70 degrees. One marcher wore nothing but a pair of white jockey shorts as he gyrated down Hennepin Avenue.

Still the parade was a fairly family-friendly event. Madusa Rose set up a face-painting station at 9th and Hennepin treating about 40 children to a free butterfly or other design. Rainbows symbolizing the LGBTQ flag were everywhere: on socks shirts capes dresses suits beads dogs — even rainbow-dyed hair.

Pat Meyer brought his three kids to the parade from St. Louis Park for the first time this year saying he did it to support his 13-year-old daughter who recently told the family she identifies as ""pansexual.""

""It opens up a lot of dialogues for us"" Meyer said while his two younger sons showed off their rainbow-colored gear. ""It's important for them to see there are no limitations to who you are.""

The parade drew some of Minnesota's biggest companies. A crew from Cargill carried signs saying ""We don't give a moo who you love"" and ""Labels are for jars not people."" Xcel Energy marched under a banner saying ""You. Us. Together."" Aveda workers wore T-shirts saying ""Be you. Do you.""

There were also two marching bands and representatives from Target Delta Air Lines Wells Fargo General Mills Ikea U.S. Bank Boston Scientific 3M C.H. Robinson Walgreens Ameriprise Financial Cub Foods Pizza Luce and the Minnesota Twins and Timberwolves among others.",,,,,,,,,

Perhaps you’re creating a game or maybe you need an input device for navigating. Whatever the case connecting an analog stick to your Raspberry Pi Pico is really easy and coding for it in MicroPython is also a snap.

Wiring a Joystick to Raspberry Pi Pico

1. Wire the joystick’s 5 pins to the Pico as follows:

GND to GND (Any GND pin)

(Any GND pin) +5V to 3V3 Out (physical pin 36). Yes a 5V joystick will work with the 3V3 power of Pico.

(physical pin 36). Yes a 5V joystick will work with the 3V3 power of Pico. VRx to GP27 / ADC1 (physical pin 32)

(physical pin 32) VRy to GP26 / ADC0 (physical pin 31)

(physical pin 31) SW to GP16 (physical pin 21). This would work with most of the GPIo pins.

Coding a Joystick in MicroPython for Raspberry Pi Pico

An analog thumbstick is effectively three devices in one: a potentiometer for the X axis a potentiometer for the Y axis and a digital momentary button when you press down. Below we’ll write some simple code to help us see where the joystick is pointing.

2. Start a blank program in your MicroPython IDE most likely Thonny.

3. Import the necessary modules: Pin ADC from machine and utime

from machine import Pin ADC import utime

We’ll use the utime.sleep function later to put a necessary delay into a loop which reads the button state.

4. Create xAxis and yAxis variables and assign them to the GP pins for each 27 and 26.

xAxis = ADC(Pin(27)) yAxis = ADC(Pin(26))

5. Create a button variable and assign it to a Pin object.

button = Pin(16Pin.IN Pin.PULL_UP)

Note that the Pin object has three arguments the GP number the mode (which is input in our case) and whether it has a pull-up or pull-down resistor (see resistor color codes to identify different types). We want it to be in input mode and pull up.

6. Create a continuous loop that checks and prints values for x y and button.

while True: xValue = xAxis.read_u16() yValue = yAxis.read_u16() buttonValue= button.value() print(str(xValue) +"" "" + str(yValue) + "" -- "" + str(buttonValue)) utime.sleep(0.1)

7. Run the code and observe the results in the MicroPython shell as you move the joystick and press the button. What you’ll likely see is that if the joystick isn’t moved or pressed the X and Y values will be around 32000 to 33000 and the button value will be 1. Moving to the left will put the X value in the 300 to 500 range and to the right will be around 65000. Pointing up will put the 300 to 500 range and pointing down will be around 65000. Pressing the button will give it a value of 0 while you hold it down.

8. Stop the execution and erase the print statement to save space.

9. Create variables for the plain English status of X Y and button. Place them within the loop and give them default values that an untouched joystick.

xStatus = ""middle"" yStatus = ""middle"" buttonStatus = ""not pressed""

10. Use if / then statements to correctly label the joystick and button status within the loop.

if xValue <= 600: xStatus = ""left"" elif xValue >= 60000: xStatus = ""right"" if yValue <= 600: yStatus = ""up"" elif yValue >= 60000: yStatus = ""down"" if buttonValue == 0: buttonStatus = ""pressed""

11. Use a print statement to print the variables and place it above the sleep command.

print(""X: "" + xStatus + "" Y: "" + yStatus + "" -- button "" + buttonStatus)

Your final code should look like this:

from machine import Pin ADC import utime xAxis = ADC(Pin(27)) yAxis = ADC(Pin(26)) button = Pin(16Pin.IN Pin.PULL_UP) while True: xValue = xAxis.read_u16() yValue = yAxis.read_u16() buttonValue = button.value() xStatus = ""middle"" yStatus = ""middle"" buttonStatus = ""not pressed"" if xValue <= 600: xStatus = ""left"" elif xValue >= 60000: xStatus = ""right"" if yValue <= 600: yStatus = ""up"" elif yValue >= 60000: yStatus = ""down"" if buttonValue == 0: buttonStatus = ""pressed"" print(""X: "" + xStatus + "" Y: "" + yStatus + "" -- button "" + buttonStatus) utime.sleep(0.1)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMjYvZGl5LW5pZ2h0LXZpc2lvbi13aGVyZS1mb3VyLWlzLWJldHRlci10aGFuLXR3by_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DIY Night Vision Where Four Is Better Than Two,"Night vision projects are great and the hardware available to hobbyists just gets better and better. [Just Call Me Koko] shows off just such a build using four low-light IR-sensitive cameras four displays and four lenses in 3D printed enclosures mounted to a helmet. Why four? Well mounting two cameras and displays per eye is the easiest way to yield a wider field of view and for bonus points it sure looks extra weird.

At its heart each of the four segments is the same. A Foxeer Night Cat 3 camera is mounted at the front its output is connected directly to a 2″ diagonal NTSC/PAL display and at the rear is a DCX (double convex) lens 38 mm in diameter with a 50 mm focal length. Add a printed enclosure and the result is a monocular night vision display. Do it three more times and arrange them around one’s eyeballs and one can make a night vision system with a panoramic view that probably takes only a little getting used to.

How well does it work? [Just Call Me Koko] does some walking around and also tries some target practice while wearing them and concludes that while they don’t have nearly the clarity of the real deal (the 320×240 resolution displays limit the details one can perceive) they do work fairly well for what they are. Also the cost of parts is a small fraction of the cost of the real thing making it a pretty enjoyable project in the end.

The kind of hardware available to hobbyists today is what makes this kind of night vision project accessible but there’s always the good old high-voltage analog method.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Latest MIT And Ericsson’s AI Research Explains How Next-Generation Lithium-Based Oxides Are Key Building Blocks Of Neuromorphic Computing,"Reddit Vote Flip Share 0 Shares

Throughout the last decade the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has grown at a rapid pace. This is partly due to developing graphics processing units and hardware accelerators for specific domains. CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology has enabled this expansion thus far.

Because of today’s evolving paradigm of “in-memory” (also known as “in-situ”) computing more efficient AI applications can now be developed than ever before. The ability of computational memory to store data and conduct computations like multiplications and additions to that data is critical to this improved efficiency. Data no longer needs to be transferred between storage and computation units which is a primary source of inefficiency in traditional AI systems.

To explain the solutions for computations and research we have summarized a research article written on Ericcson.

As promising candidates for the fundamental building blocks of such computational memories the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has selected non-CMOS ‘lithionic’ memristive devices (‘lithionic’ comes from lithium-based oxides). Lithium is an element commonly found in lithium-ion batteries but researchers at MIT are working on expanding its application beyond energy storage and processing.

Researching 6G networks and connected 6G devices which are increasingly projected to rely on AI and machine learning is the primary focus of this investigation (ML). When it comes to environmental sensing for example more and more sensor data will be generated and analyzed in the future. In addition to saving energy this type of local data processing would help to protect sensor data privacy and promote user privacy.

Unlocking neuromorphic potential

The use of lithionic memristive devices for computer memory is still in the exploratory stage and is not without its difficulties. The use cases for lithionic memristive technology the underlying memristive architectures and approaches for obtaining desirable performance characteristics are being examined.

Litionic memristive technology a new enabler for efficient neuromorphic systems may emerge soon as there’s progress in neuromorphic computing.

Definition of a memristive device

One of the essential components in electronics is the memristor (memory resistor) which is implemented in a memristive device. One of the main qualities of an ideal memristor known as a “pinched current-voltage hysteresis loop” cannot be replicated by any memristive device. “Memristor” and “memristive device” are often used interchangeably.

As a “memory resistor” you could think of an object with the ability to respond to external stimuli and retain that response. Despite their distinct composition memristors are analogous to other non-volatile memory systems like Flash.

Using Ohm’s law to perform multiplication is an example of how memristors can be utilized for data storage and computation. Memristor data storage capacity varies widely and can be as high as eight bits per memristor depending on various factors. The more bits per memristor the better; nevertheless there is a tradeoff between the number of bits and other factors including switching speed retention and endurance.

One of the main advantages of developing memristors from materials other than flash memory is that they are more scalable than conventional memory technologies (e.g. down to 10 nm or even below that). Conversely CMOS has already scaled down to below 10 nm and high-volume devices may be found with chips as small as 5 nm. Moreover memristors could offer improved operating properties such as faster switching longer endurance and better scaling than Flash. Memristors have a more extended retention period and low power dissipation making them ideal candidates for future computing systems.

Oxygen-ion memristor (left) and new Li-based memristor (right) are shown in the figure above.

A transition metal oxide is placed between two electrodes in the actual construction of a memristor (left). It is possible to grow or dissolve so-called conductive filaments within the oxide thereby altering its resistance. Various factors influencing this procedure are the strength and direction of the electric field and ion mobility. The arrow pointing down from the top suggests a possible flow of current.

Oxygen silver or copper ions and conductive filaments provide the most significant obstacles to developing memristors that use these elements.

The growth and dissolution of conductive filaments are complicated processes still being studied. As a result fine-tuning resistance is difficult. Non-idealities including stochasticity non-linearity and asymmetry contribute to memristors ‘noisy behavior. Adapting algorithms and hardware to account for noise is feasible through noise-resilient applications. Nevertheless the noise level is prohibitive for applications requiring high-precision calculation.

Innovative material science solutions are required to meet these difficulties. Lithium-based oxides are among the novel materials being studied by MIT researchers. To modify the resistance of the oxide these ‘lithionic’ memristors use processes called phase separation and metal-to-insulator transition. Lithium ions also have higher mobility than oxygen silver or copper ions which may allow for micro- to nanosecond switching in some applications.

Although lithium’s use in battery technology is well-understood nothing is known about lithium-based oxides’ use in memristive technology. The fabrication process of lithionic memristors has still to be perfected in terms of scalability and compatibility with CMOS. Furthermore system-level analyses of latency power and area at the early stage can guide the creation of lithionic memristors.

Neuromorphic computing fills the void of separating conventional computers from the human brain. Neuromorphic computing has three main characteristics: excellent power efficiency rapid environmental response and high responsiveness. Before discussing how memristors (generally speaking not only lithionic memristors) can enable neuromorphic computing let’s go through each of these qualities.

1. Efficiency in power generation and use

Here’s a simple comparison to show the kind of power efficiency neuromorphic computing aims to achieve:

It is estimated that the human brain uses less than 20 watts of electricity to carry out sophisticated cognitive tasks thousands of times less power than the most energy-efficient digital computer devices. After various assumptions and calculations it is estimated that the brain’s volume could hold 22000 modern system-on-chip devices (SoC). Furthermore a single SoC can have a power budget comparable to the complete human brain. Every analysis necessitates data movement between these two realms and this movement consumes an inordinate amount of power. In other words the initial idea that neuromorphic computing takes from nature specifically the brain’s synapses is to co-locate data and processing (recall computational memory mentioned at the beginning of the blog post). This is an excellent feature if you’re running AI/ML models like deep neural networks with many parameters and demand vast amounts of memory and processing.

2. Quickness of response

There are 860 trillion synapses in the human brain’s 86 billion neurons each linked to around 10000 other neurons via synapses. Synaptic connections represent information. Therefore the brain executes ‘processing’ at the location where data is stored. Even for complicated cognitive tasks fast inference and perception can be achieved by combining the above principles: local processing at distinct time scales and parallelism.

3. Adaptability under changing conditions

Continuous learning is essential for adaptability which is accomplished by varying the strength of synaptic connections. The brain’s ability to learn and adapt quickly and effectively with only a few examples is one of its most beautiful features. Continuous learning in artificial neural networks necessitates highly energy-efficient hardware because training with a small number of samples is not yet a mature technique for usage in these networks. The following are some of the reasons why they might be helpful:

Biochemical synapses have been compared to memristors in their dynamics (for instance stochastic switching short-term plasticity and accumulative behavior).

Because of their ability to operate as a computational memory memristors can reduce the amount of data that must be moved around allowing for higher power efficiency.

Analog crossbar arrays in which vast numbers of memristors are organized into stable structures can be used as computational memory units to achieve high density. To achieve high on-chip density high parallelism and excellent power efficiency large numbers of these units can be coupled and merged into a single neuromorphic chip.

Source: https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2022/6/lithionic-memristors-future-neuromorphic-computing

Analog crossbar arrays based on neuromorphic devices are inspired by the human brain. Similar to how synapses weigh input signals from axons of one or more pre-synaptic neurons and then sum partial results via dendrites memristors (also known as a crossbar array) w1-3 balance input signals from the crossbar array and then sum partial results.

Memristive technology has significant potential in developing biologically plausible spiking neural networks in hardware. On the other hand Memristive technology is most closely matched by applications that perform a lot of multiplication and accumulation. Analog crossbar arrays are best suited to applications that do large amounts of such processes in parallel. Vector-matrix multiplication(VMM) is an important computational kernel. It is used extensively in artificial neural networks hyperdimensional computing and other applications.

Memristors link horizontal and vertical wires (referred to as “word lines”) in a two-dimensional array (called a “matrix”) (so-called bit lines). According to Ohm’s law the current flowing from a word line to a bit line depends on the memristor’s conductance. Each memristor functions as a multiplier for the input voltage and its conductance in a crossbar array.

Source: https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2022/6/lithionic-memristors-future-neuromorphic-computing

An analog crossbar array can be used to do vector-matrix multiplication. For clarity only a 3×3 array is displayed (real arrays can be 512×512 1024×1024 etc.). I1 = I11 + I21 + I31) and Kirchhoff’s rule (e.g. I1= I11 + I21 + I31) determine the output current vector based on the input voltage vector V the memristor conductance value matrix G and the crossbar array of memristor conductance values.

Neuromorphic computing employing lithionic memristors offers a wide range of fascinating research opportunities. With enormous difficulties and a creative strategy based on use cases it’s a challenging but rewarding job.

Neuromorphic systems could greatly benefit from using lithionic memristors. Lithium-based materials have been the subject of battery research for decades. However a fundamental understanding of constructing memristors with precisely adjustable conductance is still absent. Material compatibility with the CMOS process is yet another area that needs further investigation.

There is much room for innovation regarding hardware architectures that use memristors. Inference latency and accuracy are critical considerations at the “top” design space where decisions are based on the application’s performance needs. Regarding the accuracy of digital-to-analog converters the tradeoffs are not simple. When it comes to maximizing power and area efficiency careful design decisions are required.

A suitable set of tools is needed to investigate such a design space. Simulating software rather than making physical prototypes may be more appropriate for most design exploration. Memristor-based hardware architectures will be utilized to test algorithms like artificial neural networks quickly.

The field of lithionic memristor research will be approached holistically encompassing everything from memristive devices to neuromorphic systems and AI/ML applications.

Given a bold new look last year the 2021 iMac introduced a set of playful colors a more angular look and the introduction of Apple Silicon with the M1 chip. But rather than maintaining the two size options of previous generations — 21.5-inches and 27-inches — Apple instead decided to split the difference with just one 24-inch version.

We don’t know for sure what Apple is planning next but hopefully the company is thinking along the lines of Vox Media’s Parker Ortolani who has imagined what the M2 iMac could look like when it emerges.

I know it’s hard to care today but I’ve been working on this M2 iMac concept for a few days… hope y’all like it… pic.twitter.com/vG8qTkNUwIJune 24 2022

In terms of design as you can see from the included images Ortolani hasn’t tried to reinvent the wheel merely refining Apple’s design. Gone is the white bezel of the 24-inch iMac for starters which may seem odd but it’s not just down to personal preference.

“Took em away because of the MacBook Air” Ortolani tweeted. “Figured if it was something the vast majority liked about the iMac it would’ve been applied there too. Plus if past is prologue they’ll follow the current iMac with much a [sic.] more subdued one.”

Subdued is how you might describe the colors Ortolani has picked out too. While the current iMac is available in seven vibrant shades the designer imagines just five more serious colors for the M2 iMac with only the pink version offering the playfulness of the previous generation.

He also imagines some very sharp looking Magic Keyboards built to match the new color options as well.

But the biggest change — and the one we really hope Apple adopts — is the reintroduction of a larger model for power users. Yes Ortolani imagines a 27-inch model to compliment the 24-inch version. He’s even bold enough to predict prices with an imagined $1299 starting point for the smaller model rising to at least $1799 for the larger version.

There’s certainly an appetite for a larger screen Mac experience and while there’s nothing stopping you plugging a Mac mini or Mac Studio into any size of monitor there’s something especially elegant about Apple’s all-in-one solutions.

While Bloomberg’s well connected reporter Mark Gurman once predicted a 2022 refresh of the 24-inch iMac more recently he’s stated that the hardware may skip M2 entirely with an M3 iMac arriving next year. If that’s the case these renders sadly may be as close as we get to a new Apple desktop in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYXBwbGUtbmV3LXByb2R1Y3RzLXVwZGF0ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple says it will unveil new products in upcoming months,"Maybe we'll get that headset after all...

Alert Apple aficionados: the company has reportedly hinted at new products and updated OG's to be released over the next year.

According to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman the tech giant has a few more surprises up its 2022 sleeves than what was unveiled at the WWDC conference which announced the new iOS 16 and macOS Ventura  including anticipated updates to iPhones Apple Watches and more.

The reported update lineup mainly centers around new processing and revamped specs for many familiar products including the new M2 chip which would be introduced to a variety of computer models including the M2 Pro Mac mini M2 Pro and M2 Max 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros and the M2 Ultra and M2 Extreme Mac Pro. The new M3 chip is also reportedly in the works in conjunction with a 15-inch MacBook Air.

The iPhone 14 will also get its always-on display and Lock Screen widgets in iOS 16 Gurman reports with new iPhone models releasing with an included a 48MP back camera a new front camera and Face ID design and an A16 chip. Apple Watches will get an upgrade too — Both the Apple Watch Series 8 and Watch SE will get their own S8 chip. And the new Apple TV unit may be released as well which would incorporate a new A14 chip.

Perhaps most interesting the long-rumored Apple Augmented Reality headset is still in the works (designed with the M2 chip) and consumers might get a glimpse of a revamped HomePod previously discontinued in favor of the HomePod Mini.

A building permit was issued for the expansion of the Startown Road data center on May 20 according to Catawba County building records. A spokesperson from Apple confirmed the expansion.

“We’ve been part of the Catawba County community for over a decade and are proud to continue our growth here with new investments and jobs” the representative said.

The building permit lists the construction cost at $25.2 million which includes site development and interior and exterior mechanical and electrical equipment.

Apple did not say when construction will start or how long it would take.

In April 2021 Apple committed to investing $448 million in its Maiden data center as part of plans to spend $1 billion in North Carolina over 10 years. The investment is part of an economic development agreement with the state of North Carolina.

Of the $448 million committed to Catawba County $308 million was to go toward real property construction or improvements and $140 million toward tangible personal property according to the 2021 economic incentive summary from the N.C. Department of Commerce. The data center in Maiden was first announced in 2009. The center was built on Startown Road and opened in 2012. Apple owns about 450 acres of land surrounding the data center."

Anderson/NIST

Refrigeration. When that word comes to mind you probably think about the appliance in your kitchen keeping food fresh and safe to eat. But refrigeration also encompasses air conditioning (in everything from cars to commercial buildings) the transport of food and vaccines across vast distances and much more.

A refrigeration system moves heat from a space to be cooled to the outside environment by circulating a fluid called a refrigerant. First the fluid boils into a vapor and absorbs heat. Then it condenses back into a liquid to send the heat outside. It takes a delicate combination of chemical properties for the fluid circulating inside a refrigeration system to work safely and efficiently.

Not all fluids are the same. Some are better at transferring heat while others are better at changing from liquid to vapor. Some are flammable some are toxic and many currently in use are detrimental to our environment.

Adding fluorine atoms to a refrigerant molecule can tame its flammability but that can make the refrigerant stick around in the atmosphere for many years. Combine this with the tendency of fluorine-containing molecules to trap the infrared heat that our planet emits and you get refrigerants that can be potent greenhouse gases.

To fight that environmental threat an amendment to an international treaty in 2016 called for a reduction of the use of fluids with high global warming potential. Now the entire refrigeration industry that’s responsible for keeping our lives cool is hot on the trail of alternative eco-friendly refrigerants.

But these alternatives number in hundreds of thousands so how can they know which ones have that right delicate blend of properties?

Cue NIST. Our researchers are tackling the question on two fronts: identifying the properties of the alternative fluids AND evaluating the way they would work in the refrigeration equipment that we rely on.

It’s a hot topic for our team.

Los ajustes de la economía mundial y las ventajas de conexión geográficas que tiene Nuevo Laredo son dos elementos actuales que han propiciado que sea enfocada la ciudad para el establecimiento de nuevas industrias.

“El cierre de plantas en otras partes del estado y de la frontera son propiciadas en gran parte por la nueva reforma sindical pero el enfoque en que se tiene Nuevo Laredo para establecerse es por su comodidad geográfica y la participación que tiene el Gobierno Municipal al ofertar ventajas adicionales declaró Santos Francisco Hernández Aguilar.

El Secretario General del Sindicato Nacional de Infraestructura (SNI) rechazó que el cierre de maquiladoras como el de Aptiv en Cd. Victoria sea elementalmente por efecto de crisis mundial y déficit de materia prima para producción.

“Aquí sucede que los trabajadores de la empresa ya no aguantaron el sindicato externo debido a vicios y abusos recurrentes derivados del maridaje con la CTM por eso cerro y decidió reubicarse en Nuevo Laredo para integrar Aptiv III” afirmó.

Citó dos casos; las empresas Rheem Boiler y Robertshaw donde los trabajadores decidieron desistir de la legitimación del contrato y rompieron con el Sindicato (de Trabajadores de la Industria Maquiladora de Nuevo Laredo) y quedaron acéfalos.

“La nueva reforma laboral ya les exigió a los sindicatos de contratos colectivos que representaban trabajadores la legitimación de los contratos para que siguiera válido y esto con la mayoría de la votación de la gente. Ahorita ya se empezó a desertar y a votar en contra de los contratos colectivos y ese sindicato quedó sin función representativa” abundó.

Hernández Aguilar mencionó que la reubicación de Aptiv de Ciudad Victoria permitirá iniciar aquí como Aptiv III con alrededor de dos mil 550 trabajadores en tanto que en la capital del estado se tenían tres mil 400 empleados.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGVuaW8uY29tL25lZ29jaW9zL3JlY29ydGUtZW1wbGVvcy10YW1hdWxpcGFzLWltcGFjdGEtaW5kdXN0cmlhcy1tYXF1aWxhZG9yYXPSAVtodHRwczovL2FtcC5taWxlbmlvLmNvbS9uZWdvY2lvcy9yZWNvcnRlLWVtcGxlb3MtdGFtYXVsaXBhcy1pbXBhY3RhLWluZHVzdHJpYXMtbWFxdWlsYWRvcmFz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recortes de empleos en Tamaulipas impacta en industrias maquiladoras; se van 3 mil 252,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.milenio.com/negocios/recorte-empleos-tamaulipas-impacta-industrias-maquiladoras on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGVuaW8uY29tL25lZ29jaW9zL3JlY29ydGUtZW1wbGVvcy10YW1hdWxpcGFzLWltcGFjdGEtaW5kdXN0cmlhcy1tYXF1aWxhZG9yYXPSAVtodHRwczovL2FtcC5taWxlbmlvLmNvbS9uZWdvY2lvcy9yZWNvcnRlLWVtcGxlb3MtdGFtYXVsaXBhcy1pbXBhY3RhLWluZHVzdHJpYXMtbWFxdWlsYWRvcmFz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

And the 36-year-old singer-actor used the radical fashion choice as a response to the current climate around women’s rights to their own bodies.

Styled by Alexandra Mandelkorn Monáe — who recently came out as nonbinary clarifying that they use she/her and they/them pronouns — wore a black Roberto Cavalli gown featuring a flowing sheer skirt held up by a black leather harness. The harness which featured silver hardware and a large black rose at the center was layered over a velvet bandeau-like top. Monáe paired the look with black open-toed platform heels.

The star wore their blond locks in a high curly bun which was wrapped with black cord with a singular thin braided piece hanging at the nape of their neck. They wore silver spike drop earrings a collection of silver and black bangles and chunky silver rings. Monáe also painted their nails a metallic silver color.

According to Monáe’s stylist the edgy look was partially a sartorial response to the recent Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade effectively eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion after almost 50 years. Mandelkorn posted pictures of the look to social media captioning the post “It’s giving ‘My body my choice.'”

While presenting an award during the show Monáe also referenced the current climate around the rights of those who were assigned female at birth advocating for bodily autonomy and healthcare access.

“I’d like to give a special special shoutout to Black women to Black queer artists to Black nonbinary artists. [We are] making art on our own terms owning our truths and expressing ourselves freely and unapologetically in a world that tries to control and police our bodies — my body — and our decisions — my decisions” Monáe said finishing the statement with an expletive directed at the Supreme Court during the live telecast.

Jusqu'à présent surtout la nuit et les week-ends

Cette présence constante de médecins libéraux pour réguler les appels au 15 aux côtés des médecins urgentistes hospitaliers n’avait plus cours depuis 2003 dans le département selon Dominique Cailloce le responsable du Samu 87.

« Une permanence des soins libérale était néanmoins assurée le week-end et en semaine de 19 heures le soir à 8 heures du matin. Ce qui est une spécificité que tous les départements n’ont pas la chance d’avoir… Depuis le Covid il y avait aussi un praticien le matin jusqu’à 14 heures mais personne l’après-midi. »

La proposition permettra aux patients sans médecin traitant dont le médecin est en congés et non remplacé ou dans l’incapacité de les recevoir dans un délai rapide ou aux touristes de passage d’être guidés. « L’idée est de donner des conseils médicaux de voir si la personne peut rester chez elle attendre une journée ou si sa situation nécessite une visite à domicile ou une consultation à SOS Médecins par exemple » explique le docteur Cailloce.

L’objectif est ainsi d’éviter le passage spontané aux urgences de patients qui pourraient être pris en charge en libéral.

Comment les urgences du CHU de Limoges s'apprêtent-elles à passer l'été ?

Bientôt un « service d’accès aux soins »

Cette permanence des médecins généralistes libéraux présage aussi de ce que devrait être le « service d’accès aux soins » (SAS).

Inscrit dans le pacte de refondation des urgences de 2019 et dans le Ségur de la santé en 2020 ce dispositif déjà testé en Nouvelle-Aquitaine selon l’agence régionale de santé va se déployer en Haute-Vienne au cours de l’automne porté par l’union régionale des professionnels de santé (URPS) des médecins libéraux les communautés professionnelles territoriales de santé (CPTS) et l’hôpital.

Le principe du SAS ? Mettre en place une organisation où des médecins généralistes s’engagent sur le terrain à prendre en charge des patients adressés par le régulateur.

Ce jeudi Patrick Gangloff s'est vu remettre la Médaille de l'enfance et des familles des mains du maire Jean-Louis Banino. Cette distinction est décernée depuis 1920 aux parents qui ont élevé de nombreux enfants en leur apportant leur dévouement leurs valeurs et des soins attentifs et en s'assurant de leur épanouissement personnel.

Patrick Gangloff a 69 ans et habite aux Angles depuis six ans. Il est père de quatre enfants. Il a adopté ses deux premiers fils Frédéric et Manuel respectivement 52 et 50 ans aujourd'hui. Puis a eu deux autres enfants Florent 31 ans et Marjorie 30 ans. Ce papa qui a commencé à travailler comme apprenti à 14 ans a œuvré pendant quatre ans dans les Forces spéciales. Blessé il a ensuite passé le concours de la Banque de France. Il a terminé sa carrière il y a dix ans comme agent de maîtrise. ""En parallèle pendant 33 ans je faisais partie de la réserve active des unités marines. Je suis également officier marinier honoraire"" indique-t-il.

Ce dernier a déjà reçu plusieurs médailles : l'ordre national du Mérite la Défense nationale la médaille d'or des services militaires volontaires et Travail grand or. Son parcours exemplaire est jalonné de tout autant de valeurs qu'il a transmis à ses enfants. C'est bien cela que cette nouvelle distinction vient souligner aujourd'hui. Comme l'indique Jean-Louis Banino : ""La famille joue un rôle fondamental et irremplaçable pour la structuration sociale et personnelle des enfants.""

Et de conclure : ""Cette médaille récompense des qualités essentielles mais elle récompense aussi l'amour donné. [...] Cet amour souvent indéfectible qui est le socle sur lequel les enfants peuvent se reposer grandir se construire avant de s'engager à leur tour dans leur vie d'adulte.""

In response to the news of Barron Trump being selected as one of Florida's at-large delegates to the Republican National Convention a Trump campaign official told ABC News that the former president's youngest son is ""very interested"" in the political process.

""Yes he's on the delegation roster and Barron is very interested in our nation's political process"" the campaign official said.

Other Trump family members who have played an active role in Trump's presidential campaign will also serve as at-large delegates including Trump's older sons Eric Trump Don Jr. Trump and his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle and Trump's youngest daughter Tiffany Trump.

Eric Trump will serve as delegation chair while Guifoyle serves on the Platform Committee.

The list also includes close allies of the former president who will serve as delegates including Pam Bondi Sergio Gor Steve Witkoff and Ike Perlmutter.

Smith is disappointed with Patrick Beverley for his behavior toward a fan and a producer following the Bucks' loss. (2:30)

INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis police announced Wednesday they've opened an investigation into an ""NBA player and citizen"" altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley threw a ball at a fan in the final minutes of a season-ending loss to the Indiana Pacers.

Police said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives ""who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.""

Detectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office at the conclusion of the investigation the release stated.

Cameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands hitting a fan in the head with about 2½ minutes left in Thursday's contest. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley who was holding his arm out for it the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.

Beverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of ""The Pat Bev Podcast"" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before but added that his own actions were ""still inexcusable.""

""I will be better"" he said. ""I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

Beverley added the atmosphere in Indianapolis ""was great"" aside from ""a handful of fans"" who crossed a line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98 eliminating Milwaukee in six games in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

""I will be better. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

""I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more"" Beverley said. ""That ... threw my whole vibe off.""

After the game Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.

On his podcast Wednesday Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that ""it was never my intent to disrespect you.""

A day after the loss Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley's behavior was ""not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.""

""We're better than that"" Rivers said. ""Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally -- this is an emotional game and things happen -- unfortunately you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOC9oZWFsdGgvYnJlYXN0LWNhbmNlci1zY3JlZW5pbmctbWFtbW9ncmFtLWd1aWRlbGluZXMtd2VsbG5lc3MvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mammograms are now recommended starting at age 40. Should you get one?,"CNN —

An influential group of medical experts the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended last week that most women receive a mammogram starting at age 40. Women should continue to get a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer until age 74 the task force said.

This is a marked difference from the task force’s previous guidance which was to start biennial mammograms by age 50. Women in their 40s were counseled to make individual decisions together with their health care provider but there was no explicit recommendation for them to start until they turned 50.

I wanted to learn more about why these changes were made. Who should follow this updated guidance and are there women who need to receive screening even earlier or more often? What other tests besides a mammogram may be needed? And are there preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer?

To help us with these questions I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.

People should now starting getting mammograms at age 40 according to new recommendations. yacobchuk/iStockphoto/Getty Images

CNN: How common is breast cancer?

Dr. Leana Wen: In the United States breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women and it is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetimes. About 42000 women die every year from this cancer.

It’s crucial that women know their risk factors and receive screening accordingly. Screening by definition is done before there are any symptoms. Screening can help detect cancers at an early stage before it has spread when there is the best chance for successful treatment.

CNN: Why did the US Preventive Task Force make these changes?

Wen: In recent years there has been a disturbing trend of cancer diagnoses increasing among young people. This is the case with colon cancer as well as with breast cancer.

In fact breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 20 to 49. Younger women tend to have more aggressive cancers upon diagnosis compared to older women.

This is especially true for Black women. the rate of deaths from breast cancer among Black women in their 40s was 27 per 100000 person-years compared to 15 per 100000 person-years among White women according to a 2023 JAMA Network Open study.

According to a study in the journal Lancet Oncology the mortality from breast cancer could be lowered by starting mammograms earlier at age 40.

The US Preventive Task Force’s change now makes its recommendations closer to those of other major national organizations. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for instance recommends screening every one or two years starting at age 40 and continuing until at least age 75. The American Cancer Society gives women ages 40 to 44 the option to receive a mammogram every year and recommends those 44 and 55 to get them annually. (Those over 55 can switch to every other year or can continue annual mammograms.)

CNN: Who should follow this updated guidance?

Wen: I would encourage woman to be aware of this updated guidance and discuss it with their physicians. The key is that this guidance is for women at average risk of breast cancer. Those at average risk should begin mammograms by age 40.

This guidance does not apply to people with higher risk. Everyone needs to evaluate their own risk to see if they may be at elevated risk; if so they may need additional tests and at greater frequency than these recommendations.

The updated guidance also applies to all people assigned female at birth which includes not only cisgender women but also transgender men and nonbinary people. These individuals should also have discussions with their health care providers to evaluate their risk factors and therefore how frequently they should receive screenings.

CNN: How should people determine if they need screenings more often or earlier in their lives?

Wen: The most important factor is personal or family history of breast cancer. If someone had breast cancer themselves they need to consult their oncologist or primary care provider to figure out what testing they need and at what frequency to monitor for cancer recurrence. The same goes for individuals who had prior radiation to the chest from other cancers.

Family history is also a key determinant of risk. A woman who has a sister mother or other first-degree relative with breast cancer has double the average risk of breast cancer. A woman who has two first-degree relatives has five times the risk of developing breast cancer.

CNN: What should women expect at their first mammogram?

Wen: A mammogram is an x-ray of the breasts. Generally what happens is that a technician will lead to you to a room where you take off your bra and shirt wipe off deodorant from your armpit area that could interfere with results and change into a gown that will cover you from the waist up (you don’t need to remove your underwear pants or shoes). You are then led to a mammogram machine. The technician will position you so that the machine can best capture images of your breasts.

The part of the mammogram that may cause some discomfort is when the technician positions your breasts between two plastic imaging plates that apply pressure while the images are being taken. However the discomfort is generally over within seconds. Those who are concerned about potential discomfort could consider taking Tylenol or ibuprofen an hour before the mammogram.

CNN: What other tests besides mammograms may be needed?

Wen: Someone who has a family history of breast cancer may be recommended for genetic testing. They and others at higher-than-average risk of breast cancer may need to start mammograms at an earlier age or may need them at more frequent intervals. Other tests may be used along with the mammogram. These include breast ultrasound breast MRI or both.

I want to mention that there are experts who advocate for additional testing to be done in women who have average risk but have dense breast tissue. Mammography remains the screening test of choice in these women but there are instances where they need additional imaging to better look for possible masses.

The American College of Radiology for example recommends a breast MRI in some women at intermediate risk but who have dense breast tissue. The US Preventive Services Task Force did not make this recommendation which has implications for insurance coverage for imaging. Someone very concerned about breast cancer risk should be sure to discuss this situation with their physician who can help decide what is best for them based on personal and family medical history and whether it is the worth additional cost they may incur.

CNN: What about women over 74? Why are they supposed to stop screening for breast cancer?

Wen: The US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against mammography in women 75 years or older. However other major medical societies have continued to recommend mammography in people 75 or above especially if they are in generally good health and have long life expectancies. This once again is an issue to be discussed with one’s individual provider who can take into consideration other aspects of health and the patient’s wishes.

CNN: Are there steps younger people can do to reduce their cancer risk?

Wen: Risk factors for developing breast cancer include smoking and heavy alcohol use so quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption will help to reduce risk. Studies have shown that exercise can lower cancer risk in general as well as eating more whole foods and less ultraprocessed substances.

Women should also seek care if they develop any concerning symptoms such as a new mass or lump in the breast or armpit redness or flaky skin on the breast nipple discharge other than breast milk or pain or swelling anywhere in the breast.

The Therapists Quit.,"In spring 2023 members of the American Friends Service Committee a prominent Philadelphia-based social justice organization published a letter renouncing one of their own. It alleged that Raquel Saraswati its chief equity and inclusion officer who for years had claimed to be a person of Arab South Asian and Latino descent was in fact a white woman.

Saraswati who had often spoken publicly about LGBTQ+ rights BIPOC empowerment and Islamophobia denied the allegations. Nonetheless she resigned from the organization in February as well-regarded local news outlets picked up the story. In February 2023 The Intercept quoted Saraswati’s mother saying that her daughter who legally changed her last name from Seidel years ago was “as white as the driven snow.”

Some activists compared Saraswati to Rachel Dolezal the disgraced former president of the Spokane NAACP chapter who was born to white parents but claimed she was Black.

Saraswati found a place to land after her disgrace: Full Spectrum Therapy an LGBTQ+ psychotherapy clinic in Portland that focuses on serving low-income trans and nonbinary clients. She handles equity and human resources for the clinic.

The refuge was short-lived. Soon after her hiring therapists at Full Spectrum found out who she was and raised objections to her hiring in a Sept. 22 email to the clinic’s founder. But Saraswati stayed employed. (By all accounts Saraswati works remotely from Philadelphia.)

By the beginning of 2024 more than half of the therapists at Full Spectrum had left because of Saraswati’s hiring.

Full Spectrum is one of a handful of clinics in the city that specializes in counseling for trans and nonbinary clients—a type of care that’s in increasingly high demand. In fact the absence of culturally specific and gender-identity-specific therapy is so pronounced that the Oregon Legislature recently directed $80 million to building up culturally responsive behavioral health providers—$235000 of it to Full Spectrum.

The exodus from Full Spectrum widened the desert of clinics that work specifically with trans and nonbinary clients.

“There are such limited resources for trans and nonbinary clients who can’t do private pay. That’s what makes this extra painful and heartbreaking for us” says Kaspar Woods one of the clinicians who left Full Spectrum in the fall. “It’s heartbreaking to have to bring this level of conflict to a trans person.”

Full Spectrum CEO Sam Skye says that “calling Raquel a danger to clients and staff echoes the anti-Muslim bigotry rampant today. It is very disappointing that any former staff would perpetuate these prejudices.”

Saraswati echoed that in a statement.

“The tropes of a ‘sneaky conniving manipulative woman’ and ‘untrustworthy lying infiltrating Muslim’ are deeply harmful discriminatory and hateful’” Saraswati said adding that she won’t resign. “If anything this has opened the door for me to experience further harassment and harm.”

Skye opened a small therapy practice in Portland in 2017. His aim: to serve a population that’s increasingly seeking therapy but has few places to turn.

More than 90% of Full Spectrum’s clients are on Medicaid. That means the practice serves a population that’s doubly marginalized both for their gender identity and because they’re low-income. Over the past few years Skye expanded the clinic to include more than 20 licensed and pre-licensed therapists.

Skye had joined a slice of the therapy market that the Oregon Legislature was trying to build up. Since May 2022 the Oregon Health Authority has provided $350000 in grants to Full Spectrum two-thirds of which came from a state program aimed at recruiting and retaining behavioral health providers that serve underrepresented communities.

On Sept. 8 the clinic’s clinical director announced the hiring of a woman named Raquel as the Director of People and Culture. The email did not include Raquel’s last name nor any information about her work experience. That woman was Saraswati.

In a Sept. 18 staff meeting Saraswati introduced herself. Former clinicians WW spoke to said she made vague reference to a smear campaign she’d endured earlier that year.

That rang a bell for one of the clinicians who found Saraswati’s backstory in news clips. That clinician told others what they’d found and word seemed to have circled back to Skye. On Sept. 20 Skye sent the staff a 1200-word telling of Saraswati’s story in which Skye painted Saraswati as a victim.

“Raquel shared a laundry list of conspiracy claims she’s suffered from being accused of having two husbands to wearing a prosthetic nose to being a double agent for a foreign government” Skye wrote. “She described the events that transpired at her former workplace and the ongoing harassment death threats and targeting by groups motivated by their racist Islamophobic misogynistic and homophobic aims.”

Skye called Saraswati a woman of color in his email and said Saraswati’s story was a “tale of leadership identity and overcoming adversity.”

Two days later a handful of clinicians sent an anonymous letter to Skye demanding that he fire Saraswati immediately.

“The staff of Full Spectrum Therapy assert that [Raquel’s] presence at FST presents a clear and immediate threat to the wellbeing of our clients our staff and the Portland community” they wrote on Sept. 22. “FST staff demand immediate removal of [Raquel] from all responsibilities at FST. …Staff is united in our demands and prepared to stop work to protect ourselves and our clients from further harm.”

Clinicians exchanged worries about Saraswati’s hiring in a September email chain.

One wrote of their concerns “So even while I can critique and question the social construction of race in America I am also aware that we need strong opposition to the Rachel Dolezal’s of the world from appropriating the language of gender dysphoria to justify their behavior.”

Later that day Skye scheduled a Monday Zoom meeting with clinicians about Saraswati. He instructed clinicians not to record the meeting for “legal” reasons.

Skye opened the meeting with a long statement his voice sounding tired and quivery. He called the anonymous email sent by staff the “antithesis of collective liberation” and said that “veiled threats are not acceptable here.”

One at a time staff asked Skye questions about Saraswati’s hiring process. He explained he’d hired Saraswati as a contractor in February and then hired her full-time that fall. He’d met Saraswati because she was a friend of the then-chief operating officer at Full Spectrum Trystan Reese. There was no job posting and no other candidates were considered Skye said.

“When you have a candidate whose resume is ideal and is also a diverse candidate” Skye said “there’s no reason to bring white candidates into the picture.”

To Eli Cuda a former clinician who left in November it felt like Skye had been hiding Saraswati. “It felt like we were unwilling participants in this secret” Cuda says.

By mid-December at least 10 clinicians had left the practice because of Saraswati’s hiring and Skye’s refusal to fire her. All were trans or nonbinary and several were people of color.

Quinn Rivenburgh a licensed therapist who worked at Full Spectrum from 2021 to November 2023 and supervised 12 of the clinic’s pre-licensed clinicians says Skye instructed them during the height of the Saraswati backlash to “defend the interests of the company.”

“That was a huge red flag for me” Rivenburgh recalls “due to the potential to compromise my ethics and responsibilities as a clinical supervisor.”

Rivenburgh was laid off in November after many of their direct reports quit. Some of the clinicians who departed started private practices. Others joined existing clinics. All tell WW they felt Saraswati’s hiring at Full Spectrum had the potential to hurt their vulnerable clients.

Skye called the therapists’ letter “a demonstration of discriminatory harassment containing falsehoods lies libelous statements regarding fraud and theft and malicious distortions of the truth” and added that staff turnover is typical while a business is shifting.

Saraswati says she takes her job seriously. “Under no circumstances have I ever compromised confidentiality or put any colleague at risk” Saraswati said. “This is a problem some have created in order to force an outcome.”

Users of both systems can reduce engineering time and help avoid errors from media breaks and potential incorrect entries. Automatically set connections and profile configurations and adjustments in the event of changes intelligent macros and useful functions will save valuable time when planning and designing with Bosch Rexroth’s proven modular aluminum profile system.

FRAMEpro complements the CAD environment by integrating a library of models and data that are kept up to date by Bosch Rexroth on an ongoing basis. Because CAD data no longer need to be transferred from external sources manual imports transmission errors or duplicate data are now a thing of the past.

Automatic connections and intelligent macros

Intelligent macros establish connections automatically saving time and making it easier for users who no longer need to place components themselves. Profile configuration processes are also set to automatically match connector types. Other macros make it easier to incorporate panel elements and doors.

Lean ordering processes

FRAMEpro further supports design engineers and planners with practical search sort and filter function. The selected profiles are placed in a 3D line model – centrally or with an offset – and can also be rotated. Accessories such as connectors cover caps bases and wheels can then be placed on the profiles.

FRAMEpro automatically transfers all components used including profile machining processes to a parts list which can be used to request a quote or place an order. Once the construction process is complete the plug-in also lists the strut profiles used including the necessary sawing and drilling steps.

Automatic adjustment dimensions

If the dimensions in the 3D sketch are changed FRAMEpro immediately adjusts the length of the placed profiles accordingly. Because all other components are connected via placing constraints they are also automatically adjusted. This saves valuable time and resources.

All in all the intelligent CAD plug-in FRAMEpro plays an important role in making it even easier to design structures using Bosch Rexroth’s modular aluminum framing portfolio and streamline ordering for a quicker time to market.

They are recorded by police cameras that are everywhere on street corners and subway ceilings in hotel lobbies and apartment buildings. Their phones are tracked their purchases are monitored and their online chats are censored.

Now even their future is under surveillance.

The latest generation of technology digs through the vast amounts of data collected on their daily activities to find patterns and aberrations promising to predict crimes or protests before they happen. They target potential troublemakers in the eyes of the Chinese government — not only those with a criminal past but also vulnerable groups including ethnic minorities migrant workers and those with a history of mental illness.

They can warn the police if a victim of a fraud tries to travel to Beijing to petition the government for payment or a drug user makes too many calls to the same number. They can signal officers each time a person with a history of mental illness gets near a school.

It takes extensive evasive maneuvers to avoid the digital tripwires. In the past Zhang Yuqiao a 74-year-old man who has been petitioning the government for most of his adult life could simply stay off the main highways to dodge the authorities and make his way to Beijing to fight for compensation over the torture of his parents during the Cultural Revolution.

If a developer has its way the answer to that question is ""yes"" but local elected officials are not quite sold just yet -- nor is it the first time plans have been presented to redevelop this area.

The long-abandoned Circle Factory Outlet Center formerly known as Peddler's Village (not to be confused with the Peddlers Village in Bucks County PA) at Route 35 and Atlantic Avenue in Wall Monmouth County might soon be demolished for a 550-unit multi-family development.

Key word: might.

According to the Asbury Park Press AvalonBay Communities is the contract purchaser of the nearly 22-acre property. They presented their concept to township officials in May but their plans were ""rejected"" according to court papers.

AvalonBay has asked a judge who is overseeing litigation around the township's affordable housing plan to direct the township to review its plan and discuss it with AvalonBay ""in good faith.""

A long history

According to a post on a Wall Township Facebook page the Circle Plaza Shopping Center originally opened six decades ago and it featured a supermarket Woolworth's a shoe store and others. In the 1970s its name changed to Peddlers Village. The plaza went through a remodeling in the early 90s and debuted the Circle Factory Outlets name. The last store there closed in 2017 and the plaza has been vacant since.

Not the first plan

NJ.com reports a mixed-used development which would have included a hotel over 300 apartments a stores was floated in 2019 but it never materialized after those in the area opposed the idea.

What's next

As for AvalonBay's proposal Township Administrator Jeffry Bertrand told the Asbury Park Press the township's answer to their court papers is due by the end of this month.

She was born on May 27 1965 to Ray and Rose (Ebach) Volk in Minot North Dakota. She was the eldest of four siblings.

When Durean was a small child her family moved to Norfolk Nebraska where she lived the rest of her childhood days graduating from Norfolk Senior High School in 1983. She went on to earn Bachelor Degrees in Economics and Spanish with minors in Business and Latin American Studies from the University of Nebraska Lincoln in 1989.

Durean spent a semester as an exchange student in Guadalajara Mexico and after graduating from UNL moved to Houston Texas where she taught Spanish to middle and high school students. While teaching Durean earned her Bachelor Degree in Accounting from the University of Houston. She then obtained certification as a Certified Public Accountant and Certified Internal Auditor which led to her employment at several companies in the Houston area including Arthur Andersen/Protiviti & Baker Hughes. Durean did audits in numerous foreign countries and her new career sparked her passion for international travel. She was a fiercely independent woman with an adventurous spirit that loved to explore experience and absorb other cultures whether she was traveling for work with close friends or on holiday alone. She loved to take pictures and send postcards from her exotic travels to her loved ones back home sharing her experiences.

Durean had a generous heart and was a genuine friend to many. She never let go of her love for the Spanish language by volunteering as a teacher for the program of English as a Second Language. Durean remained a true Nebraska Cornhusker fan and cheered on her favorite football team every chance she could. She loved to play games when home with family and many competitive but “friendly” games of cards and marbles were played!

Durean left Texas and moved to St. Louis Missouri in 2018 and started working for Cigna/Express Scripts. In 2020 Durean was diagnosed with cancer and began treatment at M.D. Anderson in Houston TX while continuing to work from home. May of 2021 she moved to Olathe Kansas and May of 2022 Durean moved back home to Houston to be closer to her doctors and her family of friends.

Left to cherish her memory is her father Raymond Volk of Norfolk NE; sisters Deanna (Gary) Steingard of Henderson NE and Darcy Volk of Norfolk NE; her brother Rick (Sheila) Volk of Elkhorn NE; nieces Ellie Steingard of Lincoln NE Olivia Volk Ava Volk and Lillian Volk all of Elkhorn NE; along with many aunts uncles and cousins. She will also be missed by her friends who loved supported and cared for her.

She was preceded in death by her mother Rose Volk; grandparents Clemens and Anna Volk and Tony and Margaret Ebach; aunts Rosalie Shrader and Rita Thomas; uncle Edward Ebach; and cousin Willie Patterson.

The native of Australia’s Gold Coast steadily drove through the field after rolling off sixth for the 25-minute contest.

First-time polesitter Alex Berg (No. 08 Doran-Kroll Competition Ligier JS F4) faced a tough battle from second-place Ryan Shehan (No. 66 Crosslink Kiwi Motorsports Ligier JS F4). The two raced side-by-side for two and a half laps before making contact in Turn 5 and opening up the door to their competitors.

Meanwhile Hughes had already begun his charge through the field. The 20-year-old driver took it three-wide through the Keyhole to move up to fourth on lap two and continued to make bold moves to pick up positions throughout the race. He moved into third as Shehan and Berg made contact in Turn 5 on lap three then pulled into second as he worked through the carousel on the same lap. In just four laps Hughes completed his charge to the front overtaking Berg in the Keyhole to take the point position.

“The first couple laps everyone was really close so whenever a gap opened up I just put the car there” said Hughes in Victory Lane. “We made our way up to third and then the leaders were battling and we capitalized on that to go up to the lead. Then it was just all about focusing; no mistakes and trying to pull a gap on Noah [Ping]. We pulled up to the back-markers and they were in the way a bit which cost me actually. We touched a bit which let Noah get right back on me. I had to defend for about a lap before I could bridge a gap again. From there no mistakes and brought it home for the finish.”

With Hughes leading the field to the checkered flag he was trailed by Noah Ping (No. 65 Velocity Racing Development Ligier JS F4) who made a hard charge to the front after starting in seventh. Race 1 winner Bryson Morris (No. 39 Crosslink Kiwi Motorsport Ligier JS F4) finished third with Matt Christensen (No. 45 Velocity Racing Development Ligier JS F4) and Andre Castro (No. 8 Future Star Racing Ligier JS F4) rounding out the top five.

A full run-down of the official results from Race 2 are available here.

Noah Ping driver of the No. 65 Velocity Racing Development Ligier JS F4 scored his second win of the season in the final race of the weekend at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. It was a hard-fought win for the 20-year-old who had to fight for the point position not once but twice in order to take the victory.

Starting in the second position Ping held it two-wide with pole sitter Lochie Hughes (No. 6 Jay Howard Driver Development / CSU One Cure / Lucas Oil / Pelican Ligier JS F4) all the way to Turn 4 where Hughes got out of shape and spun through the grass leaving Ping to take the lead. With Hughes out of the battle Ping led Bryson Morris (No. 39 Crosslink Kiwi Motorsport Ligier JS F4) and Ryan Shehan (No. 66 Crosslink Kiwi Motorsport Ligier JS F4) throughout the opening laps with less than two seconds separating the three drivers.

In the middle of the race Morris was able to overtake Ping to lead the field for seven laps. However Ping never let Morris open a measurable gap and was able to regain the lead with less than three minutes remaining in the event. Ping was able to not only hold on but also put some space between himself and Morris to prevent a last-lap pass.

“It was an up and down race; a bit crazy” said Ping after climbing from the car. “I don’t know what happened to Lochie [Hughes] at the start but I think he lost it. We made a little bit of contact when he spun back on to the track but luckily the car is okay. When Bryson got by me I think I was a little bit in my head because of the contact. It actually ended up getting a little wet in the Keyhole when I got the pass so he ended up out-braking himself in the wet. I waited for the car and then got back to power and was able to pass him on the inside.”

The result marked Ping’s second victory of the season with his first coming at NOLA Motorsports Park back in April. For Morris it completed a podium trifecta gathering a first second and third-place finish across the weekend.

On May 31 2021 the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources issued letters of award to investors for the production of crude oil from 57 marginal fields.

In January this year the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission announced that a total of 128 awardees emerged as successful bidders in the bid round and had made complete and part payments for signature bonuses in the oil fields.

It also disclosed at the time that 33 awardees did not make payments during the 45 days window given to successful bidders to pay the required signature bonuses for the oil fields and as such had lost their awards to suitably qualified reserve bidders.

Providing updates on the bid round in Abuja on Saturday the Chief Executive NUPRC Gbenga Komolafe announced that the successful awardees would get their licences by Tuesday.

He said “In fulfillment of the promise made early this year the NUPRC will on Tuesday in Abuja issue Petroleum Prospecting Licences to successful awardees of marginal fields in the 2020 bid round pursuant to the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.

“It will also unveil the implementation template for the host communities development trust for commencement of the provisions under Section 235 of the PIA 2021 to positively impact against restiveness in the host communities.”

Komolafe said implementing the development trust would guarantee seamless operations boost investors’ confidence and provide enabling environment for sustainable improvement of the country’s hydrocarbon resources.

“These will mark the conclusion of some of the most urgent and critical tasks inherited by the commission when it was inaugurated in October 2021 after the signing into law of the PIA 2021” he stated.

The commission had in March this year informed all participants in the 2020 marginal field bid round programme that it had put all necessary machinery in place to progress the bid round exercise to conclusion in line with the PIA 2021.

In furtherance of that resolution the commission constituted an in-house work team to distill and address the concerns of awardees with a view to close out issues affecting multiple awardees per asset and formation of Special Purpose Vehicles by awardees in line with the respective letters of award.

“Awardees were therefore enjoined to avail themselves of the resolution mechanism provided by the commission in the overriding national interest” Komolafe stated.

He added “The successful coordination and resolution of the issues culminated in the emergence of the successful awardees that would be handed over licences on Tuesday.”"

Kathy Hochul’s plan to seize and raze properties in the area in order to make way for 10 new skyscrapers.

The state’s Empire State Development Corporation is expected to vote in the coming weeks to approve the plan that officials concede will displace 473 businesses and 128 households.

The scheme backed by Mayor Eric Adams would use tax revenues from the new office towers to fund aesthetic renovations at Penn Station the nation’s largest transit hub.

Local merchants who have heard only rumblings about the plans told The Post they’re concerned about what could be in store for their neighborhood.

“This pub is my livelihood and my life basically” said Angela Reilly the 68-year-old owner of Molly Wee Pub at Eighth Ave. and 30th Street.

Reilly — who opened the bar with her late husband more than 40 years ago — first heard whispers about the state’s plans to bulldoze her entire block a year ago.

But she has not been officially notified of the fate of a building she owns which houses the pub and seven residential tenants who live above .

“They need to renovate Penn Station but they don’t need to take away the whole block” she said.

Hochul inherited the effort from ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo. In November she said the state had reduced the size of the towers by 7 percent — but did not walk back Cuomo’s plan to side-step the city’s zoning process to seize and destroy privately owned buildings.

Neighborhood groups and government watchdogs have accused the governor of diverting billions in much-needed tax revenue that would now instead line the pockets of property developer Vornado Realty Trust. Vornado CEO Steven Roth and his family have given tens of thousands of dollars to Hochul’s reelection campaign.

“There should be enough room to have the best of old and new. They just don’t want to hear that” said Samuel Turvey a lawyer fighting the project under the moniker ReThinkPennStationNYC. “They’re like locusts they have this insatiable appetite.”

Turvey’s group pegs the number of residences and businesses to be impacted at 6000 and 2000 respectively — much higher than the state’s estimates.

Other historic structures that would be demolished under the plan include the Hotel Pennsylvania on Seventh Avenue the Gimbel’s Skybridge over 32nd Street and a church that’s home to several Franciscan friars.

Rocker Steve Marshall 71 fears New York will lose a piece of music history if his soundproof recording studio — where Madonna laid down tracks before she was a one-name celebrity — were to be destroyed. The studio overlooking Madison Square Garden used to be one of 100 on West 30th Street.

“Almost every major musician in New York has either lived rehearsed or recorded on West 30th Street” he said.

When Marshall moved into the building in 1976 punk rock band Ramones drummer Tommy Ramone lived on the 2nd floor while Eric Clapton Roberta Flack and Paul Simon’s drummer Steve Gadd lived on the 15th floor.

“I feel like Jennifer Lawrence in ‘Don’t Look Up’ running around warning people not to knock down these buildings with so much music history” Marshall added referring to the 2021 Netflix movie.

Up the street at 307 West 30th Street is a brownstone from 1876 that stores the genealogy records for more than 100000 Lithuanians who moved to the US from 1886 to 2012.

The nonprofit Lithuanian Alliance of America (LAA) has occupied the brownstone for the past 112 years. The location was the first port of call for newly arrived Lithuanian immigrants before they boarded trains at Penn Station bound for coal mines in Pennsylvania steel mills in Pittsburgh or stock yards in Chicago.

“If we lost this building we would lose our history” LAA board member Antanas ‘Tony’ Dambriunas said. “More than 100 years of our history and culture would be gone. Generations of memories would be gone. It would hurt.”

The Molly Wee isn’t the only storied watering hole threatened by the redevelopment.

After serving beers for 17 years inside Penn Station sports bar Tracks was turfed out in 2019 to make way for the current renovations. The owners were not financially compensated by the state.

Three days after Tracks owners reopened their bar across the street from Penn Station Cuomo released plans to bulldoze Tracks’ new home on West 31st between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. If Tracks is kicked out again to make way for new office towers the bar owners will not be able to afford to start over for a third time.

“We may get thrown out by the MTA again” co-owner Michael O’Brien said. “After COVID and with the economy like it is we could not afford to open a third place.”

“It’s been a long road and it is all very uncertain which is frustrating.”

ESD spokesman Matthew Gorton said the plan set for a vote by ESD does not actually entail any property seizure — because the properties not already owned by the developers will be dealt with separately by whichever authority gets tasked with expanding Penn Station southward.

“Whichever Railroad entity is responsible for displacement should it come to that will need to provide relocation assistance in strict compliance with applicable laws and procedures” Gorton said in an email.

The properties already owned by Vornado contain about 150 different businesses that will shutter when the developer builds its skyscrapers with hundreds of employees.

O’Brien the owner of Tracks expects to know more after the primary election wraps up on Tuesday. ESD’s board will vote on the plan in July 2022 Gorton said.

6 Abe Figuero a regular at The Molly Wee Pub tells The Post that he considers the bar to be his second home. Matthew McDermott

Barfly Abe Figuero 73 has been drinking at the Molly Wee Pub since 1988 which has become a “second home.” He threw his retirement party there earlier this month.

“Check the hearts of the people in this neighborhood and they’ll be devastated to lose this pub” Figuero said.

“The people here have become like family.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The S&P 500 is settling into a bear market that could push the index down as far as 3000 in a worst-case scenario Bank of America said in a note published Friday.

The broad index closed the week at about 3912 meaning BofA's estimate represents 23% further downside potential.

Meanwhile a one-third chance of a recession has been priced into the stock market so far according to the note which said relying on the price-to-earnings ratio to predict the S&P 500's performance isn't as reliable as the equity risk premium.

Analysts pointed out that the current bear market is the the 27th since 1929 and historically they have resulted in a 35% average decline. That implies the S&P 500 would bottom at 3100 largely in line with BofA's worst-case scenario of roughly 3000 using its equity risk premium framework.

Forecasts for a recession have grown in recent weeks as experts say the Federal Reserve was too slow to tackle inflation and must now tighten monetary policy abruptly threatening to snuff out the economic expansion.

But that doesn't mean investors stay on the sidelines. BofA recommended staying long on the energy sector and avoid consumer discretionary stocks pointing out that energy has outperformed the S&P 500 by 44 percentage points.

Brent crude remains above $100 per barrel and is unlikely to see much downward pressure from a surge in new supply. BofA estimated that capital expenditures among US oil producers as share of operating cash flow has plummeted to a record low of 30% down from the 2011-2016 range of 80%-100%.

""On the flip side Consumer Discretionary ranks at the bottom"" analysts wrote. ""As evidenced by retailers' recent earnings consumers' shift from discretionary items to necessities poses further risk. Moreover Energy and Consumer Discretionary earnings have historically been negatively correlated.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvbmF0aW9uL2Fib3J0aW9uLXJ1bGluZy1wdXNoZXMtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy10by1jb25mcm9udC1kaXZpc2l2ZS1wb2xpdGljc9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvYW1wL25hdGlvbi9hYm9ydGlvbi1ydWxpbmctcHVzaGVzLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tY29uZnJvbnQtZGl2aXNpdmUtcG9saXRpY3M?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abortion ruling pushes businesses to confront divisive politics,"The Supreme Court’s decision to end the nation’s constitutional protections for abortion has catapulted businesses of all types into the most divisive corner of politics.

Some companies that stayed silent last month — when a draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to Politico — spoke up for the first time Friday including The Walt Disney Company which said it will reimburse employees who must travel out of state to get an abortion.

Facebook parent Meta American Express Bank of America and Goldman Sachs also said they would cover employee travel costs while others like Apple Starbucks Lyft and Yelp reiterated previous announcements taking similar action. Outdoor clothing maker Patagonia went so far as to post on LinkedIn Friday that it would provide “training and bail for those who peacefully protest for reproductive justice” and time off to vote.

But of the dozens of big businesses that The Associated Press reached out to Friday many like McDonald’s PepsiCo Coca-Cola General Motors Tyson and Marriott did not respond. Arkansas-based Walmart — the nation’s largest employer with a good portion of its stores in states that will immediately trigger abortion bans following the Friday’s Supreme Court ruling — also kept quiet.

Meanwhile the Business Roundtable an organization that represents some of the nation’s most powerful companies said it “does not have a position on the merits of the case.”

A lot is at stake for companies many of which have publicly pledged to promote women’s equality and advancement in the workplace. For those in states with restrictive abortion laws they could now face big challenges in attracting college-educated workers who can easily move around.

Luis von Ahn the CEO of the language app Duolingo sent a tweet Friday aimed at lawmakers in Pennsylvania where the company is headquartered: “If PA makes abortion illegal we won’t be able to attract talent and we’ll have to grow our offices elsewhere.”

The ruling and the coming patchwork of abortion bans also threatens the technology boom in places like Austin Texas as companies like Dell — which was already becoming more flexible to remote work because of the tight labor market — struggle to recruit newly minted tech graduates to their corporate hubs said Steven Pedigo a professor who studies economic development at the University of Texas at Austin.

A lot is at stake for companies many of which have publicly pledged to promote women’s equality and advancement in the workplace.

“Rather than stay in Austin do you go to New York or Seattle or the Bay Area? I think that’s a real possibility” Pedigo said. “It becomes much more challenging particularly when you’re looking at a young progressive workforce which is what technology workers tend to be.”

Emily M. Dickens chief of staff and head of government affairs for the Society for Human Resource Management said in a statement that nearly a quarter of organizations in a recent poll agreed that offering a health savings account to cover travel for reproductive care in another state will enhance their ability to compete for talent.

“But how these policies interact with state laws is unclear and employers should be aware of the legal risks involved” she said.

Dickens noted that companies that use third-party administrator to process claims on their behalf — typically big employers — are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act rather than state law. But companies that have to buy their own health insurance for their employees — typically small businesses — are subject to state regulations and have less flexibility in designing benefits.

Offering to cover travel expenses could also make companies a target for anti-abortion lawmakers. In March Texas State Representative Briscoe Cain a Republican sent a cease-and-desist letter to Citigroup saying he would propose legislation barring localities in the state from doing business with any company that provides travel benefits for employees seeking abortions.

In his concurring opinion released Friday Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested it would be unconstitutional for a state to bar residents from traveling to another state to get an abortion.

“In my view the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel” Kavanaugh wrote.

But a corporation’s right to fund what would be an illegal act in another state is still questionable argues Teresa Collett a law professor at the University of St. Thomas.

“That’s not an interstate commerce question per se” she said. “So you’d need the right plaintiff.”

Meanwhile tech companies are facing tough questions about what they’ll do if some of their millions of customers in the U.S. are prosecuted for having an abortion. Services like Apple Google Facebook and Microsoft routinely hand over digital data sought by law enforcement agencies pursuing criminal investigations. That’s raised concerns from privacy advocates about enforcers of abortion laws tapping into period apps phone location data and other sensitive online health information.

A letter Friday from four Democrats in Congress called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the phone-tracking practices of Google and Apple warning that location identifiers used for advertising could fall into the hands of prosecutors or bounty hunters looking “to hunt down women who have obtained or are seeking an abortion.”

The Supreme Court ruling comes at a time when companies have become increasingly reliant on women to fill jobs and especially as they face a nationwide labor shortage. Women now account for nearly 50% of the U.S. workforce up dramatically from 37.5% in 1970 — three years before the Supreme Court ruled abortions to be legal in Roe vs. Wade — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Denied access to abortion could hit low-income workers the hardest because they’re typically in jobs with fewer protections and that are also demanding from loading groceries onto store shelves to working as a health aide.

“As a direct result of this ruling more women will be forced to choose between paying their rent or traveling long distances to receive safe abortion care” said Mary Kay Henry international president of the Service Employees International Union which represents nearly 2 million janitors health care workers and teachers in the U.S. “Working women are already struggling in poverty-wage jobs without paid leave and many are also shouldering the caregiving responsibilities for their families typically unpaid.”

Sara Nelson president of the Association of Flight Attendants told The Associated Press that the ruling was “devastating.”

“It cuts to the core of all the work that our union has done for 75 years” she said. “This decision is not about whether or not someone supports abortion. That’s the distraction … This is about whether or not we respect the rights of women to determine their own future.”

Maurice Schweitzer a professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business said the handful of companies are taking a stand on the court’s ruling because their customers and employees are expecting them to speak out.

“We’re in this moment in time where we’re expecting corporate leaders to also be leaders in the political sphere” he said. “A lot of employees expect to work in companies that not only pay them well but whose values are aligned with theirs.”

But the vast majority of executives will likely avoid the thorny topic and focus on things like inflation or supply chain disruptions he said.

That too comes with risks.

“They can either support travel for out-of-state care and risk lawsuits and the ire of local politicians or they can not include this coverage and risk the ire of employees” Schweitzer said.

Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video. ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

""Twenty pounds of Epsom salt in a bath"" she said before dumping the bags into a bath. ""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong.

Wednesday's opening celebrates the redevelopment of the former YMCA building on the corner of Summer and Front streets.

This construction project will add 50 new units to the development for a total of 60 apartments 42 of them considered affordable.

The complex is for seniors and the units range in price from $800 to $1500 depending on the income of the tenant.

This project is owned and operated by the Szanton Company and Bath Housing is celebrating their work saying Bath is no exception to the state's housing crisis.

“We see a lot of people come through our office that are rent-burdened” Bath Housing Executive Director Debora Keller said. “They are paying 60 70 80 percent of their rent their income for rent and a project like this which aligns your rent to your income levels is really valuable and gives people the cushion they need to thrive as they get older.”

The property manager of the Bath development says the building is at 100 percent pre-occupancy and the company is excited to welcome in those tenants Wednesday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jdC8yMDI0L2FwcmlsLXdlYi1vbmx5L2phenptZW4tbG91aXMtYXJtc3Ryb25nLWR1a2UtZWxsaW5ndG9uLWNvdW50LWJhc2llLXR5ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke Ellington Read His Bible in the Bath,"“Does Jazz Put the Sin in Syncopation?” asked a 1921 Ladies Home Journal article. Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

The Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB) was honoured to receive two prestigious awards: “Favourite Tourist Board - Caribbean” and “Favourite Destination - Honeymoon”. Additionally Emma Madsen the JTB’s Business Development Manager for Western Canada received a Favourite Supplier Representatives award for her excellent continued efforts and strong agent support throughout the pandemic.

The 22nd Annual Agents’ Choice Awards Survey asked voters to consider which suppliers provided Canadian travel advisors with the kind of support needed to survive and stay positive during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Agents’ Choice 2022 adapted some of the award categories to reflect the events that have occurred over the past two years to ensure they were honouring amazing changemakers in the industry.

“We are truly honoured by the Agents’ Choice Awards we have received this year and want to thank each and every agent who voted for the Jamaica Tourist Board” said Angella Bennett Regional Director Jamaica Tourist Board Canada. “These awards are a true testament to the hard work and creativity of my Canadian team and I couldn’t be more proud of them for continually going above and beyond to support Canadian agents particularly throughout these past two years. The pandemic could not keep us from fostering our strong bonds within the Canadian travel community. For example we couldn’t meet in person so we brought the joy of Jamaica to agents’ home computers with our weekly Irie Hour sessions.”

Over 4100 agents voted in the 22nd annual Agents’ Choice Awards survey. Additional awards included Royal Caribbean Cruises for “Favourite Cruise Line - Large Ship” AmaWaterways for “Favourite River Cruise Line” and Air Transat for “Favourite Airline - Leisure”.

It’s exciting times for Chloe Baxter who is certainly looking forward to Saturday’s race meeting at Fannie Bay.

The 30-year-old is the new addition to the Darwin training ranks and her horse First Crusade will match it against older horses in a very open ROANT Members 0-62 Handicap (1200m).

The three-year-old gelding has performed with distinction in the Top End since arriving in April with two wins and a second over 1100m – success achieved at 0-58 level followed by a narrow defeat against his own age group at a 0-56 level.

After seven starts in south-east Queensland and on the NSW far north coast which saw him post a win in a 1410m maiden in Lismore last October First Crusade landed in the NT under the guidance of top Darwin trainer Garry Lefoe.

Baxter actually purchased the horse in February and following First Crusade’s last appearance on May 21 she has taken over as the horse’s fulltime trainer.

It’s not as if Baxter has had a falling out with Lefoe – in fact Baxter actually works for Lefoe.

It’s just that after attaining the required accreditation and necessary skills the time has finally arrived where she feels comfortable kick-starting her training career.

“I’ve been in the racing industry now here in Darwin for about three or four years” Baxter said on Friday.

“I started with Phil and Rhonda Cole just as a stable-hand and strapper with them.

“Phil taught me how to ride track work which was really good.

“I currently work for Garry Lefoe as well as for the Tayarn Halter and Lindsay Schmidt stable.

“They’ve really been incredible in my aspirations to start training.

“Garry has been great he has taught everything I needed to know in regards to training wise.

“I’ve been working for those guys for just over a year now.”

Baxter hasn’t taken a backward step in her pursuit to achieve her ambition.

And there’s no way you could question her desire and commitment.

Apart from her studies and responsibilities at respective stables Baxter also juggles fulltime employment with betting agency Sportsbet.

After studying for her relevant certificates through Skillinvest – one of the largest providers of employment and training services in Victoria – she then applied for her owner-trainer license with Thoroughbred Racing Northern Territory.

First Crusade will be Baxter’s first runner since acquiring her owner-trainer license.

“I’ve got my first runner tomorrow which is very exciting” Chloe said.

“I’ve been very lucky with First Crusade.

“He’s been an extremely handy horse and clearly likes the track and likes the dirt so that’s obviously the hardest things to find.

“He’s had two wins and a second – and then I tipped him out for a couple of weeks in the paddock to give him a bit of a freshen up and he’s come back really well and I couldn’t be happier with him.

“The race on Saturday is a bit of a test for him – he’s drawn 12 from 12 not much luck there.

“I don’t think it will actually worry him too much – hopefully he can find a bit of cover.”

Lumping 59.5kg is also one other hurdle.

Arriving in Darwin from Victoria a decade ago Baxter has always had horses from a young age and used to participate in showjumping and dressage competition.

She met Phil Cole in Darwin where she stabled her own horse and eventually started working for him.

Additionally Baxter ended up getting shares in a couple of racehorses with Cole.

So what gets Baxter’s heart pumping when it comes to horse racing?

“I think it’s probably just quite thrilling I suppose” she said.

“And just seeing horses come from spelling and getting them to the races and everything that is involved and then obviously any kind of result is just extremely exciting.”

After cutting ties with Cole on good terms Chloe now works fulltime for Garry Lefoe and rides for Tayarn Halter and Lindsay Schmidt in the mornings at Fannie Bay.

“Garry’s really given me huge opportunities to help assist and run his stable” she said.

“Tayarn has been great – she’s let me on a heap of her horses and along with Lindsay they’ve helped me a lot in the riding aspects.

“Gary Tayarn and Lindsay knew coming in that training was my end goal – they’ve just been super open and supportive and just taught me an incredible amount of information.”

Life will become increasingly busy for Baxter – if it hasn’t already – but she is currently on holidays from her job at Sportsbet which has perhaps made the transition a lot easier.

“It’s pretty full on hours from 4am to 5pm but Sportsbet is very flexible and supportive of what I’m doing as well – so I’m very grateful for that” she added.

“I’ve got one horse now and I’m on the hunt for another one – probably wouldn’t mind two or three to start with to tick me over.

“From the moment I started working for the Phil Cole stable I just absolutely fell in love with it and I can’t imagine doing anything else now.”

If you're looking for a low-risk approach to 'buy the dip' this big banking bet is worth copying

The Oracle of Omaha has had a busy quarter.

According to his latest 13F filing Warren Buffett has deployed roughly one-third of his cash into new investments during the first three months of the year.

As always Buffett’s biggest swings are noteworthy. However his decision to sell most bank stocks while adding Citigroup (C) to Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK) portfolio is puzzling Wall Street.

Here’s why this contradiction has caught so much attention.

Warren Buffett likes these 2 investment opportunities outside of the stock market

Buffett loves banks

Buffett is deeply familiar with banking and financial services. He believes the business is relatively straightforward and can be extremely lucrative if managed well.

“If you can just stay away from following the fads and really making a lot of bad loans banking has been a remarkably good business in this country” he told Berkshire Hathaway investors in 2003.

What about the 2008 Global Financial Crisis? Buffett went on a shopping spree during that time picking up stakes in JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).

For several years major banks have been the biggest holdings in the Berkshire portfolio. In 2009 he even said Wells Fargo (WFC) was his highest-conviction investment.

“If I had to put all my net worth in one stock that would’ve been the stock” he told Berkshire shareholders.

Catching Buffett on the rebound

This year Buffett has completely exited all these investments. Only a few banks remain in the portfolio.

That doesn’t mean the love affair with financial services is over.

In fact Buffett added a new bank to his collection this year: Citigroup. During the first quarter of 2022 he added 55 million shares of Citigroup to the Berkshire portfolio.

The stake is now worth $2.5 billion making it the 16th largest holding in the basket.

The bet seems to be predicated on a turnaround story.

Citigroup’s transformation

Citigroup has lagged behind its peers. Over the past five years the stock is down over 28%.

Compare that to Bank of America’s 33% return over the same period. Even the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) is up 3%.

The company is now attempting a turnaround to catch up. Last year Citigroup’s board appointed Jane Fraser as the new CEO — making her the first female leader of a major U.S. bank.

Fraser's strategy involves focusing on the more profitable segments of the business. Citigroup is selling or shutting down operations in Mexico Australia Philippines South Korea and elsewhere.

Story continues

Citi stock hasn’t fully reflected this new strategy.

An undervalued opportunity?

Citigroup stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 5.5. Its price-to-book ratio is 0.5. That’s significantly lower than the industry average of 9.5 and 1.1 respectively.

Put simply the stock is cheap.

If the new management team can streamline operations and boost profitability the bank’s valuation could catch up with peers.

Meanwhile a rising interest rate environment should provide another tailwind.

Here's why.

The Glide Foundation based in San Francisco aims to further social justice get people out of poverty and change people's lives. Super investor Warren Buffett's late wife Susie was so impressed by Glide that she launched an annual auction to raise money for it -- auctioning off a meal with her husband.

That was in 2000. Mrs. Buffett passed away in 2004 but her husband continued the tradition for many years. Now he has said that 2022's auction will be the last. Here's a look at the interesting history of this tradition at some of the winners and at Buffett's other charitable activities.

Meals with Warren Buffett

The annual auction went on hiatus in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic but it returned this year. The 20th auction for Glide was conducted as always on eBay and it concluded on June 17. The winning bids have risen significantly over the 20-plus years with the last winner in 2019 bidding $4.6 million. This year though that bid was nearly quadrupled with the anonymous winner offering more than $19 million.

The folks at Glide note that the auctions have raised more than $53 million supporting ""transformative programs and services that lift people out of poverty hunger and homelessness and advance equity through systems change.""

Buffett who turns 92 in August said in an interview with the organization:

It's been nothing but good. We've raised money but I've had a good time. I've met a lot of very interesting people from all over the world. ... The one universal characteristic is that they have a good time and they feel they've got their money's worth. But the most important thing is they feel that that money is going to be put to very good uses. ... And it translates into human beings finding that there is hope in life.

It's interesting that Buffett has done more than just raise money for Glide. Just as he has put a lot of thought into how to build his company Berkshire Hathaway to last far into the future Glide President Karen Hanrahan told Reuters ""[Buffett] has been a thought partner in thinking through Glide's future and how to set it up for the next 50 years.""

Winners of past auctions

This year's winner remains so far anonymous as have been many other past winners. Many are known though. The Financial Post listed these winners crediting Glide:

Year Winner Winning Bid 2000 Pete Budlong $25000 2001 Jim Halperin and Scott Tilson $20000 2002 Jim Halperin and Scott Tilson $25000 2003 David Einhorn Greenlight Capital $250100 2004 Jason Choo Singapore $202100 2005 Anonymous $351100 2006 Yongping Duan California $620100 2007 Mohnish Pabrai Guy Spier Harina Kapoor $650100 2008 Zhao Danyang Pure Heart Asset Management China $2110100 2009 Courtenay Wolfe Salida Capital Canada $1680300 2010 Ted Weschler $2626311 2011 Ted Weschler $2626411 2012 Anonymous $3456789 2013 Anonymous $1000100 2014 Andy Chua Singapore $2166766 2015 Zhu Ye Dalian Zeus Entertainment Co China $2345678 2016 Anonymous $3456789 2017 Anonymous $2679001 2018 Anonymous $3300100 2019 Anonymous $4567888

Investors Spier and Pabrai have written and spoken about their 2007 lunch saying that it was ""worth every penny"" and sharing some lessons learned such as: ""Approach everything with integrity"" ""Get comfortable saying 'no'"" and ""Do what you love.""

Investor Weschler's two lunches with Buffett led not only to some lessons learned but also a new job as Buffett took a liking to Weschler thought he'd fit in well with Berkshire and offered him a role investing some of Berkshire's billions. Today Weschler -- along with Todd Combs hired a bit before him -- are Buffett's investing lieutenants now investing many billions of company dollars.

Buffett and charity

While this tradition is ending it's not the end for Buffett's charitable activity. He has long been serious about philanthropy and in 2010 along with Bill and Melinda Gates launched The Giving Pledge -- an organization aimed at inspiring billionaires to publicly commit to giving away at least half of their fortunes to charity. It has signed up about 263 of them so far.

Buffett himself has a net worth recently estimated at $95 billion -- but it would be much higher had he not started giving away big chunks of it annually years ago. (He recently made his latest annual gift of $4 billion to several charities including The Gates Foundation.) Buffett plans to give away 99% of his wealth and in many recent years he has been the largest charitable donor for the year. He also holds the record for lifetime giving -- recently at some $48 billion -- and has been called the biggest philanthropist of all time.

So while it may be a shame that the annual auctions for Glide will end Buffett is still making the world a better place by putting his money to good use. As he's said ""If you're in the luckiest 1% of humanity you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3RyYWRlcnUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMjYvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtcG9ydGZvbGlvLWFsbG9jYXRpb24tMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Portfolio Allocation 2022,"Below are the Berkshire-Hathaway portfolio holdings by sector and industry managed by Warren Buffett that were reported in the 13F filing to the SEC for the 1st quarter of 2022 on March 31st.

Does Warren Buffett have a personal portfolio?

Warren Buffett’s personal portfolio consists of a 16% stake in Berkshire-Hathaway shares that are currently worth approximately $111 billion along with holdings in two banks: JP Morgan and Wells Fargo the size of these two positions are not known.[2]

What is Warren Buffett’s 90/10 rule?

Warren Buffett’s #1 money tip for retirees is a method that allocates 90% of investment capital into stock-based index funds while the remaining 10% of money is put into lower-risk investments. Buffett’s favorite exchange traded index fund is one that tracks the S&P 500 like the SPDR SPY ETF or Vanguard’s VOO. He has seen that the S&P 500 beats the majority of all mutual fund managers and that the ETFs also save investors a lot of money with much lower management fees that add up over time.

In a letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Warren Buffett outlined his investing plan to use the 90/10 rule regarding his wife’s inheritance which will be invested 90% in an S&P 500 index fund and 10% in government bonds. [1]

This keeps 90% of retirees capital growing by tracking the increase in prices of 500 of the best U.S. companies and also keeping 10% of capital safely in short term bonds to be spent on living expenses.

The S&P 500 index is a very diversified by sector for a smoother equity curve.

Growth Prospects

Growth drivers for the company will come from growing market shares of major AAA blockbuster titles on one side and more minor indie games on the other. However the company focuses on the higher end of the market using its capital to fund higher-budget blockbusters and its marketing scale to support its titles across multiple advertising platforms. Activision Blizzard’s primary competition remains other large third-party publishers such as Take-Two and EA and console manufacturers Sony and Microsoft.

As most people in the world start to have internet access this will also lead to more players. Thus helping Activision Blizzard grow its MAUs.

Another growth driver for the company will come from the firm monetizing its intellectual property year after year by providing content via sequels expansion packs downloadable content or DLC and toys illustrated by the decade-old World of Warcraft franchise and the annual versions of Call of Duty. These franchises can also generate games that move the company into new areas such as F2P (Hearthstone from WoW) and mobile (Call of Duty Mobile).

Competitive Advantages & Recession Performance

Activision Blizzard’s competitive advantage is its world-leading franchise titles. This will allow the company to continue to grow those franchise titles and possibly make spinoffs from those titles.

While the company is not immune to downturns its fee model is more resilient to such conditions. However in a server recession the company MAUs will start to decline as people will start to cut back on their monthly expenses.

As of the most recent report the company held $10.97 billion in cash and $25 billion in total assets against $7.2 billion in total liabilities. Long-term debt stood at $3.6 billion as of March 31st 2022.

ATVI is forecasted to pay out only 16% of its earnings in fiscal 2022. This payout is very safe and we expect it to continue to grow in the double digits annually in the years to come. For example over the past ten years the company has had an average annual dividend growth rate of 11%. So far the company has increased the dividend for twelve consecutive years.

Valuation & Expected Returns

Because of its lousy quarter results we expect the company to make $2.92 per share. This will decrease 22% from 2021 when the company made $3.72 per share. However we expect a five-year earning growth of about 10%.

Shares trade for about 23.4X earnings today a little below our fair value. The stock’s five-year average P/E ratio is 23.7X earnings. Still that leaves the potential for a ~1% tailwind to total returns from the valuation in the years to come.

The company pays out a minimal dividend. The current dividend yield is 0.6%. Thus most of the return will come from earnings growth and valuation.

Final Thoughts

Activision Blizzard looks to be fairly valued at the current price. This was due to the Microsoft buy-out announcement which helped the stock price shoot up. Because of this we give ATVI a hold rating at today’s price.

Wade decision while Warren Buffett is reportedly planning a big investment in abortion rights. Spencer Platt/Getty Images

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday stripping back abortion rights nationally.

Billionaires including Bill Gates Melinda French Gates and George Soros tweeted their opposition.

Warren Buffett could huge sums to a foundation funding abortion rights: The Wall Street Journal.

Some of America's most prominent billionaires have denounced the overturning of Roe v. Wade as Warren Buffett reportedly sets in motion plans for big donations to reproductive rights.

Bill Gates Melinda French Gates and George Soros all tweeted their opposition to the Supreme Court decision to roll back abortion rights nationally overturning a near-50-year precedent. Abortion was automatically banned in 13 states that have trigger laws while others are expected to follow.

Bill Gates tweeted: ""This is a sad day. Reversing Roe v. Wade is an unjust and unacceptable setback. And it puts women's lives at risk especially the most disadvantaged.""

Gates' ex-wife French Gates who shares the Gates foundation with the Microsoft co-founder tweeted: ""Today a government in which women have never had an equal voice reached deep into the most private corners of a woman's life to tell her the choice over what she does with her body is no longer her own. This is America taking a big step backward.""

She added: ""But one court decision was never going to be enough to protect women's equality. And it will not be enough to dismantle it either. Right now there are people all over the U.S. who are recommitting to the work ahead.""

—Melinda French Gates (@melindagates) June 24 2022

George Soros who according to the Bloomberg Billionaires' Index is worth $8.5 billion said: ""The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn #RoeVWade ends federal protections for abortion diminishes human rights and greatly threatens reproductive care. We have invested in reproductive rights organizations that are fighting back at this moment.""

Other billionaires have joined Soros – who has significantly more wealth tied up in his Open Society foundations – in investing heavily in access to abortion prior to the Supreme Court's decision.

Jeff Bezos' ex-wife MacKenzie Scott has been another proponent of reproductive rights and donated a record $275 million to Planned Parenthood last year. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has planned to invest $1 billion in family planning by 2030.

But a reported windfall from Warren Buffett – worth $97 billion – could pump tens of billions of dollars into the ongoing battle. In 2006 Buffett pledged to donate 85% of his shares in Berkshire Hathaway to charity. Most of that has gone to the Gates Foundation.







But according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation – named after Buffett's late wife – is preparing for a huge windfall.

According to tax filings the bulk of the Buffett Foundation's funds have gone to abortion and reproductive rights. The Wall Street Journal reported that Buffett could donate in excess of $70 billion to his late wife's foundation according to filings the paper reviewed."

If you're hoping to play online games with the Nintendo Switch you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online membership. The Xbox and PlayStation require subscription plans to allow online multiplayer gaming and Nintendo Switch Online is a similar proposition.

The good news is that Nintendo Switch Online costs less than PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass at $20 a year. (You can also pay in installments at $4 a month or $8 for three months but the $20 for 12 months plan is the best value.) That plan gets you online play online cloud saves and access to some free games you can play as long as you're subscribing to the service. But it'll only cover one Nintendo Switch account holder.

Nintendo Switch Online $20 at Best Buy Like Low yearly cost

Low yearly cost Family bundle option

Family bundle option Lots of included retro Nintendo games Don't like Optional Expansion Pack has N64 games at a steep step-up price

Families with multiple Switches or anyone with multiple accounts on the same Switch will need to pay $35 a year which covers up to eight family members. Otherwise the only way to play many games online will be through whichever individual account has the Switch Online membership.

Online play: For me it's essential

You don't need to play Nintendo Switch games online and Nintendo's games are arguably the most offline-friendly experiences offered by the big three console makers. (You can also get tons of local same-room multiplayer games.) Still a lot of Nintendo's games have online multiplayer and for that alone the service is essential. Nintendo's online multiplayer features aren't always great but they're slowly getting better over time: Switch Sports Mario Strikers: Battle League and Animal Crossing are all online-focused and many of Nintendo's recent games have online features.

There are some games that don't need Switch Online and most of them are free-to-play games such as Fortnite or Fall Guys. So there are ways to live with a Switch without Nintendo Switch Online.

Cloud saves: They come in handy

Cloud game saves are useful if you have multiple Nintendo Switches. Hopping from one Switch to another to play a game is a lot easier when you can just load your game save from the cloud. If you have multiple Switches in your household only one can be set up to play games while offline but the others can be used while Wi-Fi connected.

Even if you're a solo-Switch household you might want this for upgrading from for example the original Switch to the new OLED version. If you don't have cloud saves game save data can still be transferred between systems.

'Free' games: Nintendo's retro offerings are a nostalgic treasure trove

Nintendo dangles a few game freebies for Switch Online subscribers but far fewer than either PlayStation Plus (which recently added some new tiers for extra premium and retro games) or Xbox Live Gold or Game Pass Ultimate which cycle games monthly.

Nintendo leans on its NES and SNES classic games both of which come in Switch apps that semi-regularly update their libraries with new titles. There are 62 NES games right now and 54 SNES games so it's a lot to keep you busy. The NES and SNES apps mimic what Nintendo used to offer on those cute plug-in NES and SNES Classic retro consoles or in ""Virtual Console"" games on the older Wii and the Nintendo DS and 3DS. One fun advantage of these games is that many of them are playable online.

My favorite Online freebie game is Pac-Man 99 a battle royale competitive game like Tetris 99 where you play Pac-Man against 99 others to try to survive. I love it dearly.

Games like Pokemon Snap are great to have but are they worth the extra yearly price? Nintendo

The step-up Expansion Pack: You don't need it

Nintendo has a step-up tier called the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack which adds Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis retro game collections (about 16 N64 games and 25 Genesis games so far). Both of those compilations have some excellent games including Zelda: The Ocarina of Time Mario 64 Mario Kart 64 Sonic 2 Phantasy Star IV. They also come with game save features built in but they're not worth the added price of the step-up plan unless you're a die-hard N64 or Genesis fan. N64 games are hard to find otherwise but there aren't many available yet. The Genesis games can be had in other ways; there's an excellent separately sold Sega Genesis Classics compilation on the eShop plus some standalone Sega Ages games. At an extra $50 a year for the Expansion Pack (or $80 for a Family subscription) it doesn't seem worth it.

Nintendo's also started adding some other DLC content with the Expansion Pack to sweeten the deal: a Splatoon 2 expansion extra Mario Kart 8 Deluxe courses and Animal Crossing extras. These can be bought separately at about $25 each.

The best value among console subscriptions? Not entirely

It could be said that for $20 Nintendo's Switch Online fee is a better deal than Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. It doesn't have the discounts or continuous flow of high-end freebie games that the others have but it certainly costs less. I also appreciate there's also a family subscription for Switch Online considering how many Switch players are in my house.

I'm not wild about having to pay yearly fees for game consoles but $20 for a Switch Online membership is acceptable. The Expansion Pack service however probably isn't worth it unless you have a serious love affair with N64 games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9nb29nbGVfcGl4ZWxfNmFfbGlzdGVkX29uX2Jlc3RfYnV5c193ZWJzaXRlX2FoZWFkX29mX3JlbGVhc2UtbmV3cy01NDgwNS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Pixel 6a listed on Best Buy's website ahead of release,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.gsmarena.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /google_pixel_6a_listed_on_best_buys_website_ahead_of_release-news-54805.php (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000029D4A83AAD0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9nb29nbGVfcGl4ZWxfNmFfbGlzdGVkX29uX2Jlc3RfYnV5c193ZWJzaXRlX2FoZWFkX29mX3JlbGVhc2UtbmV3cy01NDgwNS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi93aHktdGhpcy1mdWppZmlsbS1jbGFzc2ljLWlzLXRoZS1iZXN0LWNoZWFwLW1pcnJvcmxlc3MtY2FtZXJhLXlvdS1jYW4tYnV50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why this Fujifilm classic is the best cheap mirrorless camera you can buy,"Here's something the camera manufacturers aren't too eager to tell you: there's never been a better time to buy a second-hand mirrorless camera.

I learned this accidentally after a recent experiment. Rather than lug around my main camera and a weighty bag of lenses on a photo walk I grabbed my five-year-old Fujifilm X-T20 instead. After giving it a cold refreshing firmware update we popped out for a relaxing day of garden squares and dog portraits.

The experience was pretty revelatory. My original aim had been simplicity – tired of tripods and faffing with ND filters I fancied a return to the simple pleasure of taking handheld photos with a small camera and a couple of lenses.

But my day with the X-T20 also reminded me of a few important things. Firstly most people (including me) buy more camera than they really need. Secondly some five-year-old mirrorless cameras are still really really good. And thirdly smartphones are the most joyless cameras ever made.

(Image credit: Future)

Perhaps that's a little harsh. But compared to a prodding a slippery rectangle my day with the X-T20 felt like the photographic equivalent of tearing around country lanes in a Porsche Boxster. It also sent me down something of a wormhole – how much can you buy an X-T20 for these days? And is it now the best cheap mirrorless camera you can buy?

The answers I discovered are respectively 'well under half what I paid for it' and in my opinion 'yes'. There are certainly plenty of even more affordable cameras which you can find in our guide to the best cheap cameras. But in terms of bang-for-buck the Fujifilm X-T20 is tough to beat – and the reason is because it's the point at which mirrorless cameras started to hit diminishing returns. Well for stills photography at least...

Photo finish

Mirrorless cameras have evolved a lot in the five years since the Fujifilm X-T20 arrived. But most of these advances have been related to usability and video. If you're a beginner who's looking for a little companion to improve your photography skills and you aren't too fussed about video then the X-T20 is very much a modern sweet spot. Particularly at today's second-hand prices of around $450 / £350 / AU$600.

It isn't the only great mirrorless camera in that price ballpark. Olympus and Panasonic – which launched the DMC-G1 the first proper mirrorless camera in 2008 – also released some fine options during that golden era for hobbyist cameras from 2015-2018. If you're looking for second-hand bargains you should definitely also consider the similarly-priced Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II E-M10 Mark III and Panasonic Lumix GX80/GX85. All three can be found for around $350 / £300 second-hand.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)

But after my day out with the Fujifilm X-T20 I jotted down eight reasons why I think it's the best value second-hand mirrorless camera for beginners. The first is its design. The original idea behind mirrorless cameras was that they could be smaller lighter and simpler alternatives to DSLRs for everyday shooting. The X-T20 absolutely nails this concept.

Sure it's still twice the weight of an iPhone 13 Pro but its metallic construction viewfinder and controls make it an infinitely more enjoyable photography companion. Which brings me onto my second reason: its dials.

(Image credit: Future)

More than just a nostalgic nod to film cameras these are still a brilliant way for beginners to learn the exposure triangle – and the fact that most Fujifilm lenses come with an aperture ring means you get a fun tactile shooting experience on a very small body.

Thirdly there's the X-T20's sensor. I originally chose the camera over its Micro Four Thirds rivals because its APS-C sensor is twice the size of those as the alternatives from Olympus and Panasonic. This means it's good in low light for such a small camera but also pretty forgiving if you make mistakes.

(Image credit: Future)

For example when I ran into this apparently A-list dog in its chauffeur-driven car I'd stupidly left the camera set to a high shutter speed which pushed the ISO up to 3200. No matter; the X-T20's X-Trans CMOS III sensor the same as the one in the pricier Fujifilm X-Pro2 and X-T2 is fine at higher sensitivities like this and its files respond well to a little noise reduction.

This sensor was renowned for its ability to produce great JPEGs with lovely colors and that still stands today. It has an ability to extract drama and atmosphere from scenes without going overboard in the way that smartphones tend to do. If anything its metering has a tendency to occasionally underexpose shots which is fine because you can always pull that detail back later if needed.

(Image credit: Future)

If you do fancy going for something a bit more dramatic and social media-friendly then there's my fourth reason for picking the X-T20 over the alternatives: Fujifilm's Film Simulations.

These proprietary 'recipes' emulate the look of the company's old film stocks and are a great way to quickly inject some character into your shots. It may lack the latest ones like Eterna but the X-T20 does have nine of them and playing around with likes 'Monochrome' is always a joy in high-contrast scenes.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)

It may be retro but the X-T20 does have a tilting touchscreen; my fifth reason for picking it over older mirrorless cameras. That might not sound much but it was Fuji's first camera with a touchscreen and I still prefer this screen design over the more modern video-friendly displays that flip out to the side.

This touchscreen doesn't work with the camera's menus and it feels about as responsive as your smartphone it's had a few whiskies but you can customize it so that only one half of the screen responds to touch – handy if you want to move the AF point around with your eye up to the viewfinder. The tilt mechanism is also a real bonus over your phone when it comes to shooting from awkward angles.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)

That tweakable touchscreen neatly leads into my next two reasons: the X-T20's customizability and versatility. You can change the function of pretty much every button and dial on the camera – and for such a small camera there are a lot of them. Fingers confused by the lack of an ISO dial? You can just map it to the function button on the top.

Unlike larger cameras you can also adapt the size of the X-T20 to suit the kind of shoot you're doing. If you hand yearns for a bit more camera to hold onto you can always add a third-party grip – then remove it to turn it into a smaller more travel-friendly companion. That's something you just can't do with a bigger mirrorless camera or DSLR.

Glass master

Why not just buy a premium APS-C compact camera instead? Because the X-T20 benefits from the final and perhaps most important of the eight benefits I noted down; a great range of lenses. One of the main reasons photographers have been drawn to the X-series are these lenses which are both high-quality and smaller than full-frame equivalents.

But if you're buying a relatively cheap mirrorless camera there's little point in splashing hundreds or thousands on lenses. Fortunately there's two bits of good news on that front.

(Image credit: Future)

Firstly Fujifilm makes cheap versions of some of its own lenses that used the same optical construction as pricier ones but simply have a plastic build. For example the XC 35mm f/2 costs only $199 / £169 / AU$299 new and would make a great companion for a used X-T20.

Also in the past year or so Fujifilm has finally opened up the X-mount to third-party lens makers. This means Sigma Viltrox and Tamron have all made some good-value lenses for cameras including the X-T20 with the promise of more en route.

And if you want to dabble with some really affordable glass there's always the dirt-cheap manual lenses from the likes of 7Artisans that work nicely with this camera thanks to its handy 'focus peaking' which colors the parts of your image that are in focus.

Pet project

So is the Fujifilm X-T20 is the perfect camera then? Far from it and my list of niggles is almost as long as the good stuff.

It isn't weather-sealed the battery only lasts for a few hundred shots its tripod thread is bafflingly positioned right next to the battery door there's no autofocus joystick the viewfinder is small its 4K video quality trails its rivals and Fujifilm's companion app is still pretty dated.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)

Still even five years on I didn't find any of these to be deal-breakers or major handbrakes on the shooting experience. Perhaps even more interestingly I also didn't find the X-T20's comparatively ancient processor or autofocus to be a huge barrier either.

The two biggest photographic advances on mirrorless cameras in recent years are burst shooting speeds and subject-tracking autofocus. The new Fujifilm X-H2S for example can shoot at a ludicrous 40fps with full AF-tracking and can automatically spot animals birds cars bikes planes and trains in your scene in order to track them with Terminator-like precision.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)

While these are nice-to-haves they absolutely aren't essential for taking photos of moving subjects. The X-T20 may not support newer UHS-II SD cards but it can still fire off shots at 8fps for a few seconds even when you're shooting in raw. It's certainly no pro sports camera but I was pleasantly surprised at its performance when attempting to snap an excitable French Bulldog.

There were definitely more AF misses that I've experienced with more recent cameras and its buffer does clog up pretty quickly. But for the odd shot of a rapidly-moving pet or child it's more than up to the task – and with the right lenses will produce far better results than your smartphone.

The fun factor

The lesson from my day of shooting with the Fujifilm X-T20 then is that while modern comforts like Animal Eye AF are impressive and useful they're far from essential for most hobbyist photographers. And that goes for quite a few of the quality-of-life camera upgrades we've seen in the past few years.

It's a very different story when it comes to video. If you're a 'hybrid' shooter who shoots a mixture of still and moving images – as most professionals now are – then you're likely to become quickly frustrated by cameras like the X-T20. This is where the likes of the Sony A7 IV Panasonic Lumix GH6 and new Canon EOS R7 really come into their own.

(Image credit: Future)

But if you're looking for a stills camera that strangers and pets warm to rather than recoil from then few can match the value provided by the X-T20. Not sure how to track one down? Our guides on how to buy a second-hand camera and how to get a great DSLR or mirrorless camera for under $500 will steer you in the right direction.

If you don't fancy chancing your luck on eBay there are an increasing number of marketplaces like MPB  Back Market and (in the UK) London Camera Exchange which offer warranties on second-hand cameras.

They may not offer the slick AI-powered experiences offered by today's best mirrorless cameras or phones but the X-T20 and its brethren are hard to top for value and the fun factor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoaXRlY29hdGludmVzdG9yLmNvbS9idXlpbmctYS1ob21lLXRoZS1yaWdodC13YXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Way to Buy a House the Right Way | White Coat Investor,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.whitecoatinvestor.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /buying-a-home-the-right-way/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000029D4A83BA60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoaXRlY29hdGludmVzdG9yLmNvbS9idXlpbmctYS1ob21lLXRoZS1yaWdodC13YXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2Rnb29kZ29vZC5jby9hcnRpY2xlcy9hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZXMtdG8tYW1hem9uLWZvci1ib29rc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9 Best Online Bookstores That Aren't Amazon,"This article is a part of our ongoing series on Amazon Alternatives

Jeff Bezos initially founded Amazon as a bookselling empire ultimately putting many physical bookstores out of business.

Amazon is able to leverage its massive scale to sell books for incredibly cheap. They’re able to slash prices (sometimes to a point of losing money) to ensure they have the lowest price — in the hopes of making the money back from other purchases and means. (RIP Barnes & Noble or your favorite local book shop.)

It’s a radical act to choose to buy books from a more ethical marketplace knowing that you may be paying more than you’d pay with Amazon.

However many smaller booksellers offer incredible exclusive products (signed copies merch and more) or even intimate events with your favorite authors. It’s worth it to know that a writer or indie publishing house you love can keep doing the work they love because you chose to spend a few extra dollars.

Choosing ethical and sustainable alternatives is a choice that thousands of people are intentionally making in an effort to support other booksellers.

Better World Books

In 2001 a few college friends saw an opportunity to turn unwanted books on their Notre Dame campus into an opportunity to make a difference.

They requested book donations from students who had extra books or textbooks that they didn’t want or couldn’t sell at the end of the term. After six months they had collected 2000 books and resold them for $10000. They turned around and donated the profits.

Since then Better World Books has operated as a social benefit business accepting donated books from individuals libraries and campuses and reinvesting its profits to fund literacy and education initiatives — all while keeping books from ending up in landfills.

According to their website they’ve raised more than $28430000. Better World Books is a certified (and founding) B Corp and offers carbon-balanced shipping.

To investigate whether ribozymes previously selected for aminoacylation with BYO (tyrosine analog) would react with substrates having other aminoacyl side chains six additional biotinyl-aminoacyl oxazolones were synthesized for analysis (Fig. 1A): tryptophanyl (BWO) phenylalanyl (BFO) leucyl (BLO) isoleucyl (BIO) valyl (BVO) and methionyl (BMO). This set of substrates represents three chemical classes (small hydrophobic aromatic and sulfur-containing). Within the group of small hydrophobic side chains both β-branched and -unbranched residues were included. The set includes side chains that are considered early as well as side chains that are considered late additions to the genetic code5455565758. In particular aromatic residues of which two were chosen to assess specificity within the class are thought to have been added relatively late. The span over chemical space as well as putative prebiotic age of the substrates therefore probes general trends rather than a specific epoch during the emergence of translation. In order to assess the generality of any observed trend five wild-type ribozymes were chosen for analysis representing five different families containing three unrelated motifs (Supplementary Table 1).

Fig. 1: Aminoacylation activity of two ribozymes with BXO substrates. A Biotinyl aminoacyl oxazolones (BXO) used in this study: tryptophanyl (BWO) phenylalanyl (BFO) leucyl (BLO) isoleucyl (BIO) valyl (BVO) and methionyl (BMO). B Aminoacylation activity of two ribozymes (S-1A.1-a the center of Family 1A.1 and S-2.1-a the center of Family 2.1) with BXO substrates analyzed by streptavidin gel shift on native PAGE (X = F L I M V or W as indicated; see Methods for details). Reactions were conducted for 90 min at 500 μM BXO. The reacted RNA is detected by its slower migration through the gel due to complexation with streptavidin. This experiment was conducted once; also see Fig. S11. Since a single reactive site was identified (Fig. S12) multiple bands on native gels may be caused by the presence of multiple conformers or streptavidin oligomers. MW markers are the Low Molecular Weight Ladder (dsDNA) from NEB. Structures were drawn using ChemDraw 19.0. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image

Compounds were synthesized using previously described methods24 and verified by NMR spectroscopy (see Methods). An initial test by a streptavidin gel shift assay at high substrate concentration (500 μM) indicated that each oxazolone served as substrate for at least one ribozyme tested although the two tested ribozymes (S-1A.1-a and S-2.1-a) differed in selectivity (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. 11). For these ribozymes reaction products were not observed when a single residue (G65 and G54 respectively) was chemically modified to 2’-O-methyl indicating that reaction occurs at a single site (Supplementary Fig. 12A). This observation is consistent with previously reported results for these ribozymes reacting with BYO24. This result was further confirmed by direct PAGE analysis of the reaction product (without streptavidin added) under acidic conditions which shows a mobility difference between aminoacylated RNA and unreacted RNA (Supplementary Fig. 12B)59.

To study the cross-reactivity of these ribozymes and their mutants systematically pools of sequence variants were designed to explore the sequence space around five sequences representing each of the major ribozyme families obtained from the selection on BYO (Supplementary Table 1). The ribozyme families chosen for testing include all of the previously discovered motifs (Motifs 1 2 and 3) specifically the two most abundant families containing Motif 1 (Family 1A.1 and 1B.1) and Motif 2 (Family 2.1 and 2.2) as well as the only family identified from Motif 3 (Family 3.1). These ribozyme families had been discovered during an exhaustive search of sequence space varying a central 21-mer region and sequences from these motifs had comprised ~80% of the selected pool24. Sequencing of the variant pool showed that it included 13.5% of the unique sequences from the originally selected pool (having abundance ≥10−6). Thus the variant pool based on these five ribozyme families was designed to be representative of ribozymes having aminoacylation activity.

These ribozymes had been identified through selection with substrate BYO. To probe the sequence space for additional motifs we also performed in vitro selections using substrates BFO and BLO starting from libraries with completely random 21-mer variable regions. These selections followed a process identical to the original selection with the exception of the substrate compound. All families found in the BFO and BLO selections had already been identified in the earlier BYO selection (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly selection with BLO resulted predominantly in sequences containing Motif 2 consistent with the low activity of a Family 1A.1 ribozyme on BLO observed in the gel shift assay (Fig. 1B). While it is possible that cross-contamination of sequences from prior selection with BYO in the laboratory could bias the results of these selections the failure to identify new motifs indicated a lack of new ribozymes having appreciably greater activity on BFO or BLO suggesting that the designed pool of variants would likely include major motifs of the active sequence space.

Cross-reaction of self-aminoacylating ribozyme mutants with alternative side chains

Sequences in the ribozyme variant pool were assayed for activity on each alternative substrate in a massively parallel format by kinetic sequencing (k-Seq)244960. During k-Seq a pool containing thousands of candidate ribozymes was reacted with a substrate at multiple concentrations. The reacted molecules having been biotinylated through reaction were isolated by streptavidin binding and then sequenced on the Illumina platform. Quantitation of the reacted fraction was used to fit to a kinetic model to determine ribozyme activity. Data obtained from this method have been shown to correlate well with traditional biochemical assays with confidence intervals of the measurements obtained by experimental replicates and bootstrapping49. In each k-Seq experiment one of six BXO (X = W F L I V or M) substrates was tested to measure reaction kinetics for sequences in the pool. Samples were exposed to substrate concentrations from 2 to 1250 μM in triplicate. Reaction data were fit to a pseudo-first-order kinetic model (\({F}_{s}^{{BXO}}={A}_{s}(1-{e}^{-{k}_{s}[{BXO}]{\alpha }t})\)) with maximum reaction amplitude A s and rate constant k s for sequence s where \({F}_{s}^{{BXO}}\) is the fraction of RNA that is aminoacylated with substrate BXO [BXO] is the initial substrate concentration t is the reaction time (90 min) and α is the coefficient accounting for substrate hydrolysis during the reaction. The product k s A s  reflecting ribozyme activity at non-saturating conditions was accurately estimated across a wide range of activities2449 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The data yielded k s A s estimates for a total of 9770 sequences encompassing five family wild-type sequences and a complete set of both single and double mutants related to the five wild-type ribozymes (Supplementary Fig. 3).

k-Seq measures the combination of catalyzed and non-catalyzed (background) reactions. To measure the catalytic activity of the RNA the nonspecific background reactivity of the substrate with RNA should be taken into account. In analogy with catalytic power used to characterize enzymes we determined catalytic enhancement i.e. the ratio of catalyzed to background reaction rates. Since RNA sequences were being compared against each other it was natural to use the reactivity of the substrate with bulk low-activity RNA from the pool as the background reaction rate. We measured the rate of the background reaction for BFO by gel shift assay with the randomized RNA library. The background rate was 0.55 ± 0.18 M−1min−1 (μ ± σ) which is within error to that measured previously for BYO (0.65 ± 0.28 M−1min−1)24. Comparing to the frequency distribution of k s A s measured by k-Seq (Supplementary Fig. 4 Supplementary Table 2) the measured background rate was found to correspond to the center of a low-activity peak indicating that this peak represented a background of catalytically inactive or nearly inactive mutants. This is consistent with observations that individual Motif 1 ribozymes display little activity with some substrates at high concentration when analyzed by a gel-shift assay (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. 11). The low-activity peak was therefore used as an internal control in k-Seq and the effective background reaction rate (k 0 A 0 ) of each substrate was estimated as the center of this peak. k s A s values for sequences reacted with each substrate were normalized by the corresponding k 0 A 0 to obtain the catalytic enhancement above background or r s (defined as r s = k s A s /k 0 A 0 for each sequence s).

The r s values obtained from the k-Seq experiments revealed that all tested families contained sequences which displayed some activity on a new substrate or on multiple new substrates (Supplementary Fig. 5). Details of the frequency distribution of catalytic enhancement depended on both the aminoacyl side chain of the substrate as well as the ribozyme family. The distribution of sequences in Families 1A.1 1B.1 and 3.1 could be characterized as containing a peak centered around background activity accompanied by a long high-activity tail particularly with BWO and BFO (Supplementary Fig. 5). In contrast the distributions of Families 2.1 and 2.2 displayed distinct peaks at higher activity with bimodality apparent in some cases (especially for Family 2.1). This indicated a higher tolerance for mutations in Families 2.1 and 2.2 than in 1A.1 1B.1 and 3.1 as mutant sequences were less likely to exhibit substantial detrimental effects.

Ribozyme families distinguish different chemical features of substrate side chains

To assess the activity and specificity of individual ribozyme mutants for each substrate catalytic enhancement values for different substrates were compared in a pairwise fashion (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 6). All families displayed a high degree of correlation among activities for non-aromatic amino acid analogs (BLO (Leu) BIO (Ile) BVO (Val) and BMO (Met)) and also between activities for the two aromatic analogs (BWO (Trp) and BFO (Phe)) (Fig. 3A). The high correlations indicated that few sequences exhibit large activity differences between amino acids within the same biochemical class.

However when comparing amino acids of different classes (i.e. aromatic vs. non-aromatic) strong correlations were only observed for Families 2.1 and 2.2 indicating that the effects of mutations in Motif 2 sequences tend to be relatively independent of the side chain. In contrast Families 1A.1 1B.1 and 3.1 showed substantially lower activity with non-aromatic side chains (Fig. 2) resulting in lower correlations between activity on aromatic and non-aromatic side chains (Fig. 3A). These preferences were also captured by the slopes on the correlation plots (Fig. 3B) which confirm that Motif 1 sequences strongly favor aromatic side chains while Motif 2 sequences demonstrate less pronounced preferences and Motif 3 sequences display an intermediate strength of preference. While less pronounced than for Motif 1 some preferences were still observed for Motif 2 sequences in which BFO was most preferred BMO BWO and BLO were weakly preferred and BVO and BIO were disfavored. Interestingly BVO and BIO in contrast to the other side chains are both branched at the β carbon position. For Family 3.1 BFO was preferred over BWO and all non-aromatic substrates were similarly disfavored. The differences observed between trends characterizing the separate ribozyme motifs suggest differences in the recognition mechanisms among Motifs 1 2 and 3. Nevertheless all ribozyme families display some preferences that correspond to chemical features of the side chains.

Substrate specificity is positively correlated with activity

To probe the relationship between catalytic activity and substrate specificity we used two measures of specificity. First as a general measure of substrate specificity for each sequence we adapted the ‘promiscuity index’61. Here promiscuity refers to the ability of a sequence to react with multiple substrates at a similar level of activity. The promiscuity index \(({I}_{s}=-\frac{1}{{\log }N}{\sum }_{i=1}^{N}\frac{{r}_{i}}{{\sum }_{j=1}^{N}{r}_{j}}{\log }\frac{{r}_{i}}{{\sum }_{j=1}^{N}{r}_{j}})\) is a normalized entropy which describes the evenness of the distribution of rates across different substrates. The promiscuity index I s ranges from 0 to 1 such that sequences that are completely promiscuous having equal activity on all substrates would have I s = 1 and sequences completely specific to one substrate would have I s = 0. Promiscuity was observed to decrease as overall activity increased for all families (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 7).

Fig. 4: Relationship between activity and promiscuity. Promiscuity index values for each sequence as a function of total activity (sum of activities with all tested substrates). The general trend indicates that specificity increases (promiscuity decreases) as overall activity increases. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image

Second since ribozymes in some families displayed preferential activity with aromatic amino acids compared to non-aromatic amino acids we calculated the relative preference for aromatic substrates as \(({r}_{s}^{{BWO}}+{r}_{s}^{{BF}O})/{\sum }_{X}{r}_{s}^{{BXO}}\). This ‘aromatic preference’ ratio reflects the proportion of ribozyme products that would have aromatic side chains in a reaction containing all six substrates at equal sub-saturating concentration (Supplementary Fig. 8). Both the aromatic preference and the promiscuity index showed that the total activity of a sequence was positively correlated with specificity (positively correlated with aromatic preference and negatively correlated with promiscuity index; Table 1).

Abundance of opportunities for co-option for alternative substrates

Sequences that can function with multiple substrates could potentially be co-opted to adopt new functions (i.e. react with new substrates). To quantify the frequency of sequences able to react with multiple substrates we categorized sequences as active or inactive using a catalytic enhancement threshold r t . Sequences below this threshold are considered to be nearly inactive being close to the background rate (see above). An activity threshold of r t = 5 was chosen for two reasons. First this threshold is two-fold more than the estimated 95% range for background activity (Supplementary Fig. 4 Supplementary Table 2) so values of r s > 5 are statistically significantly greater than the normalized background rate. Second increasing the rate of reaction by a factor of 5 is potentially significant in a prebiotic context as abundances are expected to depend exponentially on relative fitness. Using this threshold ribozyme mutants that were active on more than one substrate were considered capable of co-option (i.e. potentially able to adopt a new substrate).

Consistent with the observation that sequences in Families 2.1 and 2.2 displayed a high level of correlation of activities among all tested substrates these families also had the most sequences being active with at least two substrates (1029 sequences in Family 2.1; 853 sequences in Family 2.2) and many were active with all six tested substrates (Fig. 5). Such sequences would be capable of co-option for new substrates. In contrast Families 1A.1 1B.1 and 3.1 which contain more inactive sequences and generally preferred aromatic amino acids had most sequences accepting only one (or zero) substrates. Of sequences accepting multiple substrates in Families 1A.1 1B.1 and 3.1 most were only active with two substrates. Nevertheless even in these families >2% of sequences accepted 2 or more substrates (254 sequences in Family 1A.1 278 sequences in Family 1B.1 and 43 sequences in Family 3.1).

The frequency distribution of the fraction of unique sequences in each family (y-axis) that is active on a given number of substrates (x-axis). Activity on 2 or more substrates indicates potential for co-option. While Motif 2 sequences (Families 2.1 and 2.2) show a higher abundance of sequences active on more substrates all families possess some sequences with activity on multiple substrates. Inset shows an enlargement of the low y-value region of the plot. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image

Increase of co-opted activity on the fitness landscape

The sequences identified as presenting opportunities for co-option are active on two (or more) substrates but may not be optimally active on either. To determine how readily co-option might lead to a sequence with increased activity (i.e. to the optimally active sequence on a given substrate within the sequence space explored here) through evolution over the fitness landscape we investigated the connectivity of optimal sequences (i.e. fitness peaks) for each substrate within the fitness landscape defined by each substrate for each ribozyme family. With the exception of Family 3.1 the substrate peaks (highest r s ) for each family were accessible to one another by evolutionary pathways proceeding through single mutations while maintaining some activity (i.e. maintaining \({\sum }_{X}{r}_{s}^{{BXO}} > 30\) in analogy to r t = 5 for 6 substrates) (Fig. 6). Family 3.1 was unique among families in that the few co-optable sequences active on non-aromatic substrates were isolated in sequence space from the larger number of aromatic-preferring ribozyme mutants. While aromatic substrates were generally preferred substantial increases in the activity on non-aromatic substrates could be obtained through 1-2 mutations. This analysis indicates that the number of mutations from wild-type required to improve activity on a new substrate can be relatively small.",,,,,,,,,,,,

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's securities regulator proposed rules to regulate private pension investment via mutual funds setting the criteria for qualified products and sales agents under a scheme that will channel fresh savings into the country's capital markets.

The draft rules published by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) late on Friday came after Beijing in April launched a milestone private pension scheme to tackle challenges of aging population.

Under the scheme eligible Chinese citizens can buy mutual funds savings deposits and insurance products via their own individual pension accounts potentially boosting a pension market that has lured foreign asset managers including Fidelity International and BlackRock.

The proposed rules ""have set a relatively high bar for products and institutions and are designed to ensure safety of pension fund investment and protect investors' interest"" the CSRC said in a statement on its website.

Initially pension target funds with at least 50 million yuan ($7.48 million) of assets over the past four quarters are eligible under the pilot pension scheme the CSRC said.

Other types of retail funds with clear investment strategies and good long-term track records will be gradually added to the eligibility list as the scheme expands the CSRC said.

Currently there are 91 pension target funds that meet the CSRC's criteria according to TF Securities.

In addition fund managers and sales agents participating in private pension business must set up internal control systems adopt long-term incentives and ensure independent operation of the pension assets according to the rules.

Independent consultancies estimate China's private pension market will grow to at least $1.7 trillion by 2025 from $300 billion currently.

In 20 years 28% of China's population will be more than 60 years old up from 10% today making it one of the most rapidly-aging populations in the world according to the World Health Organization.

Gaia is the name of the seven-metre wide rotating sculpture of Planet Earth suspended from the vaulted ceiling of Cobh’s St Colman’s Cathedral as part of the Cork Midsummer Festival.

It was in St Colman’s that Hansey from Glanmire and Gary from Blackrock exchanged wedding vows on Friday June 17 having had to postpone the event due to the pandemic.

“Our wedding was originally meant to be June 2020 and we have had three previous wedding dates so finally on the fourth attempt we did it!” says Hansey.

“We were also blessed with a little girl six months ago and her name is Gia — very similar name to the installation in the church Gaia.”

The bride says she had “no idea” until a few weeks before the wedding that the art installation would be in place.“I didn’t know what to make of it at first” she says. “I was thinking 'Now there’s going to be a globe in the middle of the aisle?' Then when I actually saw it in real life it blew my mind. It is magnificent.”

Taking her dad’s arm just two days before Father’s Day was also special.

“As we entered the cathedral my father looked up at the sculpture of the globe and said 'I’d like to give you the world that’s how much I love you'” says Hansey.

Hansey Sexton and her bridal party

And the father-of-the-bride Derry Sexton also had words of wisdom for en route in the car: “He told me not to be nervous and take in every single moment as I’d been looking forward to it for so long — and he was so right!” she says.

“He also joked halfway up the aisle that this was my last chance to run! It was a special moment with him walking up the aisle and one I will cherish forever.”

Hansey and Gary met on a night out in Cork city eight years ago. “We had friends in similar circles so we had lots in common and hit it off from the get-go. Cork is a small place after all. Gary has worked abroad a lot in Amsterdam over the last number of years but made the permanent move home to Cork in March 2020” says the bride.

Hansey Sexton and Gary Power held their wedding reception in the Fota Island Resort Hotel

The couple got engaged four years ago on the beach in Mojácar in Spain where Hansey’s family holiday every summer.

Their original vision was to enjoy “a classic traditional church wedding” says the bride.

“With the addition of the globe it was almost cinematic and looked like something from a movie” says Hansey.

Another special aspect of the wedding was the bridal veil a gift from her aunt also called Hansey. “It was a gift from my aunt who had it custom-made but she unfortunately passed away in 2020 and was sadly missed on the day” says Hansey. We got engaged in 2018 the year Meghan Markle was married. Meghan had a fantastic long veil and my aunt said I’ll get you a veil like that. I felt like she was there with me in spirit.”

They were married by a relative of the groom Fr Liam Power and held their reception in the Fota Island Resort Hotel.

Toasting to their future happiness were both sets of parents Mary and Derry Sexton; and Bertilla and David Power; and the groom’s grandmother Freda Lombard.

San Jose-based American Motors Group purchased Michael Chevrolet Michael Toyota Michael Cadillac and Michael Volkswagen at the beginning of June.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The four dealerships are now known as Blackstone Chevrolet Blackstone Toyota Blackstone Cadillac and Blackstone Volkswagen.

Stephen Cornelius president of American Motors said after the success of their Toyota dealership in Lancaster and Palmdale he began looking at similar markets.

Knowing what Cornelius was looking for one of his brokers took notice of the Michael Automotive Group at Blackstone and Bullard avenues.

Cornelius said opening in Fresno is very advantageous cost-wise compared to San Jose. The city was one of the few in the state that had positive population growth and in terms of income Fresno ranked among the top five in the nation for growth.

“Fresno is an attractive market” said Cornelius. “It’s not a small town — with over a million people — but it has that small town feel.”

Cornelius looks for dealerships with opportunities for growth. He uses technology to guide his inventory purchases.

The top retailers in the market get that way from knowing what cars people are buying and how much they are paying he said.

Trucks are unloading new inventory at the dealership now Cornelius said. Being a brand-new dealership they get a “special acquisition” of cars to get them started — adding about 25% more inventory than the current level.

Cornelius also operates Stevens Creek Toyota and Stevens Creek Chevrolet in San Jose. He also runs a classic car company called American Motors Custom and Classics selling muscle cars and European sports cars.

A group of direct lenders led by Blackstone is providing about $5bn of debt to help fund the leveraged buyout of software maker Zendesk.

A group of direct lenders led by Blackstone Inc is providing about $5bn of debt to help fund the leveraged buyout of software maker Zendesk Inc according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The financing for the acquisition of the company led by Hellman & Friedman and Permira includes a $3.75bn term loan and a $350mn revolving credit facility according to a filing on Friday. It also includes a loan of $750mn to $1bn that can be drawn at a later date according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing a private transaction.

The lender group also includes Apollo Global Management Inc Blue Owl Capital and HPS Investment Partners the people said. Blue Owl is acting as administrative agent on the loan one of the people said.

Representatives for Blackstone Hellman & Friedman Permira Apollo Blue Owl and HPS declined to comment. A spokesperson for Zendesk didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The financing for the acquisition also includes $6.32bn of common equity as well as $500mn of preferred equity according to the filing.

Direct lenders flush with cash after a record year for fundraising and somewhat insulated from the selloff in financial markets have swept in to provide loans for buyouts as credit markets seize up. Some sponsors are even bypassing the public markets altogether as banks struggle to offload debt they’ve committed to provide for acquisitions selling loans and junk bonds at steep discounts and risking billions of dollars of losses on an $80bn backlog of debt sitting on their balance sheets.

A few buyout firms have turned to cash-rich private lenders to place the riskiest piece of their buyout financings.

A group of lenders led by Ares Management Corp bought the unsecured portion of the $11.15bn debt financing supporting Elliott Investment Management and Brookfield Asset Management’s acquisition of US TV ratings business Nielsen Holdings Plc.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s asset management division stepped in with a $865mn second-lien loan to help fund Brookfield Asset Management’s acquisition of auto-dealership software company CDK Global Inc.

Direct lenders also provided $2.5bn to fund private equity firm Thoma Bravo’s $10.7bn purchase of software company Anaplan Inc earlier this year.

San-Francisco based Zendesk is being acquired for about $9.5bn. Including debt the deal is valued at about $10.2bn and shareholders will receive $77.50 per share.

The deal followed an announcement by Zendesk earlier this month that it would remain independent after failing to find a potential buyer. Zendesk said in a statement at the time that even though it had extended the process to allow would-be buyers to secure financing “no actionable proposals were submitted.”",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone’s Nucleus Office Parks invests over Rs 100 crore in properties’ ESG upgrade,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

Both decisions get the history wrong.

There is ample reason to disagree with originalism as a legal philosophy. Should a 21st century society really interpret its Constitution by the standards of 1787 — an era before the introduction of semi-automatic weaponry steam power penicillin automobiles trains electric lights and indoor plumbing? In some ways though that’s a pointless debate at the moment. With originalists holding six of the Supreme Court’s nine seats we’re all living in an originalist world.

The functional problem with originalism is that it requires a very very firm grasp of history — a grasp that none of the nine justices and certainly few of their 20-something law clerks freshly minted from J.D. programs possess.

It’s difficult to become an expert in American political legal or social history. It’s quite easy though to cherry-pick historical examples that prop up an end in search of a rationale — which is precisely what the Supreme Court majority did this week twice.

In its recent gun control decision just like in its recent abortion decision the Supreme Court’s majority showed just how intellectually fragile the originalist project really is.

“A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.”

Many Americans find the Second Amendment poorly constructed and confusing. Historians do not. In the 18th century when Congress passed and the states ratified the amendment political consensus held that rights and obligations were two sides of the same coin. “The rights of persons that are commanded to be observed by the municipal law are of two sorts” wrote Sir William Blackstone the eminence grise of Anglo-American legal scholarship. “First such as are due from every citizen which are usually called civic duties; and second such as belong to him which is the more popular acceptance of rights … reciprocally the rights as well as the duties of each other.”

As it pertained to gun ownership the right to bear arms was inextricably connected to the citizen’s obligation to serve in a militia and to protect the community from enemies domestic and foreign.

The concept of a “well-regulated” community — one in which order prevailed and one which male citizens had a duty to uphold — was not a rhetorical quirk specific to the Second Amendment. It was a pervasive term. The founding generation shared a widespread belief that there was a tension between “natural liberty and those principles of equal security established in a well-regulated society.” In this context most Americans in the 1790s would have found the Second Amendment crystal clear. The federal government could not prevent citizens from dispatching their obligation to protect their communities namely by maintaining armed militias.

The Pennsylvania state constitution adopted in 1776 and often cited incoherently by opponents of gun control was perfectly clear on this point when it affirmed that “the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state.” Notably this provision did not appear alongside sections establishing individual rights to free expression and religion. There was a distinction observed Albert Gallatin who later served as Pennsylvania congressman and U.S. Treasury secretary between “a declaration of the rights of the people at large or considered as individuals.” And on this point the Pennsylvania constitution was unambiguous. “The freemen of this commonwealth and their sons shall be trained and armed for its defence under such regulations restrictions and exceptions as the general assembly shall by law direct.”

Scribble Scrabble the pen name of an influential polemicist in Massachusetts (it was common for prominent men to write pseudonymously) echoed this prevailing logic when he held that the Massachusetts “Bill of Rights secures to the people the use of arms in common defense.” As for the individual right to bear arms it existed Scribble Scrabble maintained it “being a natural right and not surrendered by the constitution” — unless and until the “legislature shall think fit to interdict.” Meaning under the terms of the commonwealth’s new constitution the right to bear arms joined with militia service was constitutionally guaranteed; the right to bear arms in an individual capacity was a natural and common law right that the legislature could proscribe.

In the case of the Second Amendment Congress sought to assuage the concerns of antifederalists who feared the rise of a large standing army that might stamp out Americans’ liberties much as the British army had done in the 1760s and 1770s. The amendment provided that Congress could never deprive people the right to own firearms in the dispatch of their obligation to fulfill militia service. The right to own a gun for individual self-protection was a different — a matter of common law that as Scribble Scrabble noted could be expanded modified or taken away by legislation.

The distinction between collective rights and obligations to bear arms and individual rights to gun ownership was widely understood. In Virginia Thomas Jefferson attempted to include a specific individual right to bear arms in the state constitution to complement the existing provision safeguarding militias. His effort failed. Similar efforts failed in other states.

One might argue that early state constitutions were distinct from the federal Constitution approved by convention in 1787. But these early state documents deeply informed the federal effort in Philadelphia. The discussion around their adoption lends an understanding of how Americans thought about rights in the late 18th century.

But to appreciate how the founding generation thought about firearm regulation we can look at what they did and not just what they said. James Madison the author of the Bill of Rights twice introduced state legislation in Virginia that would impose penalties on any individual who “bear[s] a gun out of his inclosed ground unless whilst performing military duty.”

You read that right. The author of the Second Amendment drafted statewide legislation that was effectively a forerunner to the New York state law that the Supreme Court just struck down. The bill which was really aimed at regulating deer hunting did not pass. But it clearly demonstrated that Madison viewed individual gun ownership as well within the state’s regulatory prerogative.

In the Early Republic local and state authorities frequently confiscated guns from persons they deemed a menace to public safety or simply disloyal. Pennsylvania denied any individual who “refuse[d] or neglect[ed] to take the oath or affirmation” of allegiance to the commonwealth the right to keep firearms in his “house or elsewhere.” Massachusetts imposed the same restriction on “such Persons as are notoriously disaffected to the Cause of America or who refuse to associate to defend by Arms the United States Colonies.” Otherwise put: no loyalty no militia service; no militia service no gun.

States in the Early Republic commonly regulated the concealed carry of guns. In Ohio “whoever shall carry a weapon or weapons concealed on or about his person such as a pistol bowie knife dirk or any other dangerous weapon shall be deemed guilty.”

They also commonly regulated gunpowder as well limiting the amount of ammunition an individual could keep and store at one time. Why? Because it was dangerous. Whole towns could catch fire and burn to the ground. The logic of originalism would suggest that states therefore have a right to regulate magazine sizes.

By originalism’s own tenuous standards the right of states to constrict individual gun ownership is as American as apple pie. But the Fourteenth Amendment poses its own challenges.

The Bill of Rights originally proscribed what Congress could do. States on the other hand were free to limit the freedom of speech assembly religion and firearm ownership — the right to due process — the right to a jury trial. And they frequently did.

The Fourteenth Amendment changed this equation. Ratified in 1868 it established that “No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”

It would take decades before the Supreme Court used the Fourteenth Amendment to “incorporate” the Bill of Rights and thereby extend its provisions to the states. But that was the unmistakable trajectory.

The Republican Congress that wrote and passed the Fourteenth Amendment did so in reaction to a very specific set of circumstances. In the aftermath of the Civil War former Confederate states passed a wave of “Black Codes” that attempted to restore slavery in all but name. State-level black codes impressed Black children into labor restricted former slaves’ right to assembly and speech and notably barred them from owning firearms. The amendment’s framers clearly intended to extend the protections afforded by the Bill of Rights to the states. These protections included the right to bear arms as conservative originalists — including Justice Thomas in his decision — consistently argue.

Again it’s one thing to cherry-pick historical examples. It’s another to know one’s history.

Jonathan Bingham the amendment’s principal author was very clear. The new provision was intended to require equal treatment under the law. States could not afford some people the right to free expression or assembly (or gun ownership) but not others strictly on the basis of race. The idea wasn’t that citizens had a right to individual gun ownership. It was that states could not discriminate on the basis of race.

Moreover Republicans in 1868 were deeply invested in the maintenance of “Negro militias” formed by Reconstruction state governments that protected those same state governments from violent overthrow by Klansmen and other while paramilitary units allied with the Democratic Party. As in 1787 during Reconstruction the constitutional framers viewed gun rights through the prism of collective communal obligation.

The Ulysses S. Grant administration reacted with great concern when Klansmen in South Carolina attempted to disarm Black militias whose guns had been furnished by the Republican-led state government. Notably in their enforcement efforts the attorney general and U.S. attorney for South Carolina rested their argument on the right and obligation of citizens — Black citizens — to fulfill militia service and thereby safeguard their local communities and state. The question at hand they argued was an organized attempt to “rob the people of their arms and to prevent them from keeping and bearing arms furnished to them by the State Government. Is not that a conspiracy to defeat the rights of the citizens secured by the Constitution of the United States and guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment?”

None of this is to say that citizens should or should not be permitted to own guns. That’s another question.

But by its own shaky logic there is simply no compelling originalist argument for a constitutional right to individual gun ownership. Framers of the Bill of Rights firmly held that the right to own guns existed solely in concert with the obligation to fulfill militia service and preserve a well-regulated peace.

That doesn’t mean that states cannot allow citizens to own and carry guns openly or concealed. If the state of Texas wants to go that route its legislature can (and has) passed positive laws to that effect. But there is no historical basis for a constitutional standard that denies New York or New Jersey the ability to restrict individual gun ownership.

The court also relied extensively on history to prop up its decision overturning women’s constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy arguing that “the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868” when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified criminalized abortion. This is too clever by half. By the majority’s originalist standard we should be guided by the prevailing laws and traditions in place when the Constitution was adopted. In the late 18th century when Congress drafted the Bill of Rights common law held that abortion was not criminal until the moment of “quickening” — the moment when a woman first felt a fetus move or kick. She alone could attest to the facts. In English and colonial courts if a woman testified that her fetus had not been quick she was held harmless of charges. Well into the 19th century ads for patent abortion medicines ran prominently in newspapers and journals. States began outlawing abortion only in the mid and late 19th century largely in response to efforts by (male) doctors to de-legitimize midwives and other paraprofessionals. By originalist logic those laws were unconstitutional and should not be a basis for later interpretation. My point is not that abortion is constitutionally protected because it was a common law right in 1787. Rather the court’s majority is cherry-picking its history grasping for any historical example that props up the end it hopes to achieve.

Curiously in the space of 24 hours the court’s majority moved the goal posts — 1790s for guns 1850s or so for abortion — in determining what historical standard should inform the boundaries of constitutional exegesis.

The broader problem is that originalism essentially requires judges and their law clerks to earn a Ph.D. in American (and probably as well early modern English) history. A legal theory constructed on historical foundations doesn’t work if jurists aren’t well-versed in history.

Rows of trolleys marked with team names such as “Mario Bros” and “Wildcat” wait for technicians to complete a daily dance of tools and parts. Getting the choreography right pays: production stoppages at the Renton factory can filter through to US GDP figures.

Never has the value of smooth operation been more apparent to the jetmaker than in the past three years. The factory lines were stopped for more than a year following two fatal crashes of the 737 Max. In 2018 and 2019 a total of 346 people died when hardware malfunctions and badly designed software caused the planes to override pilots and plunge from the sky.

Boeing one of America’s manufacturing champions is now hoping to show that it is ready to move on from the Max disaster even as it continues to struggle with the fallout from Covid-19 – which rocked the entire industry – and tries to work out the uncertain future for aviation technology.

On the first visit by journalists this month to Boeing’s factories in Seattle since before the Max crashes executives sought to portray a company that is ready for recovery and growth once more. Greg Hyslop Boeing’s design boss said there were “reasons for optimism” about the planemaker’s technological abilities.

Optimism is coming from the top. Dave Calhoun promoted to chief executive in early 2020 after his predecessor’s botched handling of the Max scandal last week said “demand for airplanes is as robust as I’ve ever seen it – I think it will get more robust”. He has previously described 2022 as a “turning-point year” even if he warned that supply chain problems could last to the end of 2023.

On the financial front at least that turning point appears imminent. Cashflow should turn positive in the second half of the year according to investment bank analysts bringing to an end a string of eye-watering losses with a cumulative cash burn of $34bn (£28bn) since the Max was grounded. Most of those analysts believe Boeing can become profitable and increase its share price over the coming years.

However Airbus with which Boeing shares a bitter rivalry is pulling further ahead as the world’s biggest planemaker. Airbus’s annual plane deliveries first overtook Boeing in 2003 but competition was close until 2019 after the Max grounding. Now Boeing is far behind with 340 deliveries to Airbus’s 611 last year. Airbus is preparing to build 70 of its bestselling A320 family every month compared with the 31-a-month rate for the 737 Max.

Over the sound of riveting Dennis Eng director of business operations at Renton said the factory would achieve that target “later this year”. “We assess our ability to increase rate continually” he added but the focus was “stability” of production for now.

Nick Cunningham an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners said of the gap between the two planemakers: “It gives Airbus an insuperable benefit in terms of unit costs and their ability to buy from suppliers.”

Another potential problem hanging over Boeing’s programme is the recertification of the shorter 737 Max 7 and longer 737 Max 10 variants. Boeing is racing to complete the process before the end of the year but if it misses that deadline it will be forced to develop a new flightdeck under rules brought in by US Congress following the Max crashes. That could cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars.

Boeing is throwing staff at the problem. It has hired “hundreds” of extra engineers to work on certification in the face of an unprecedented level of scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) according to Mike Fleming Boeing’s senior vice-president in charge of the Max return.

The FAA’s own credibility was also deeply damaged by the Max disasters and accusations that it had been played by Boeing. In one internal email a Boeing engineer boasted of using “Jedi mind tricks” to get the potentially dangerous software in the Max past regulators without changes to flight manuals that might have informed pilots of what was going wrong.

Fleming acknowledged that it was the regulators who would determine whether Boeing reached the end-of-year deadline and that regulation in general was “quite a bit more rigorous than what we’ve had in the past”.

“We’re working to certify the airplane to the regulations that are in place” he said. “I don’t think either side is going to try to rush anything forward.”

It is not only the Max presenting Boeing with challenges. The company’s 787 Dreamliner was made of carbon composite rather than metal but has not lived up to its name: deliveries have been stalled for more than a year after it suffered quality control problems at another facility in Charleston South Carolina.

The investment bank Jefferies has cut its forecasts for deliveries of the 787 this year from 45 to only 12 which would mean millions of dollars in lost earnings.

At Everett a factory half an hour’s drive north of Seattle that lost the 787 work to Charleston sits a symbol of a different more glorious era. In the largest building by volume in the world workers on the third-last 747 jumbo jet are making a (hopefully temporary) fix with duct tape to the aircraft’s nose which swings open to allow in freight. However activity is winding down.

Production will stop by the end of the year after 1574 deliveries of the plane – “the Queen of the Skies” – that became the symbol of the jet age. There is no plan yet for the factory space in Everett; it could soon become the “world’s largest empty cupboard” said one expert.

It is also unclear what direction the company itself will take. Calhoun’s decision last month to move Boeing’s headquarters from Chicago to Arlington Virginia within easy reach of the Pentagon’s procurement officials suggests its defence business – where more predictable revenues have weathered the pandemic – could be in the ascendant.

That will mark an end of a period this millennium during which Boeing has moved away from its historical roots in Seattle. Journalist Peter Robison in Flying Blind a recent book about the 737 Max disaster characterised the Chicago period by its focus on cost-cutting and $30bn in share buybacks in the mould of Jack Welch the corporate celebrity who led General Electric. Calhoun was a Welch employee and golfing partner.

Some analysts question whether the planemaker will return to aerospace dominance in this new era. Boeing’s longer-term prospects will be dependent on future models but it has dithered. It abandoned one plan for a “new midsize airplane” (NMA) a twin-aisle aircraft that would have sat between the 737 Max and the larger 787 and it is unclear what its next step will be.

Perhaps the larger question hanging over Boeing’s production plans is how it will cope with a world of net zero carbon emissions. Even if many in the industry are sceptical about the extent of its commitment Airbus has announced several research projects looking at alternative fuels including electric/gas hybrids and hydrogen to be used either in a gas turbine or in a fuel cell.

Boeing has also carried out tests on storing hydrogen safely in flight and it has a stake in an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) start-up but it is otherwise betting the farm on “sustainable aviation fuel” or SAF. Chemically near-identical to the standard kerosene used in planes SAF comes from non-oil sources such as plants or through chemical processes using electricity.

“Whatever you believe about electric and hydrogen we’re going to need a lot of SAF” Boeing’s chief sustainability officer Chris Raymond told reporters.

The NMA was in part a victim of Calhoun’s decision to cut Boeing’s global workforce from 160000 employees to 140000. Industry observers are concerned that engineering and cutting-edge technology including on reducing carbon emissions has suffered. Boeing’s research and development investment has fallen every year since 2016 according to Richard Aboulafia a consultant at Aerodynamic Advisory.

At the same time Boeing must compete with software tech companies (including former Seattle area start-ups Amazon and Microsoft) for workers. Competition was intense Hyslop acknowledged but engineers were drawn to Boeing because “you can build an airplane that can change the world”.

However it has been some time since that has happened. Having abandoned the NMA project Boeing has now gone nearly two decades without building a “clean-sheet” plane that was not an update of an older model. Planes going through certification at the moment are all updates albeit with notable upgrades such as a folding wingtip on the wide body 777X allowing it to squeeze into standard airport slots.

Hyslop bristled at the suggestion that the company might not be capable of coming up with groundbreaking planes in the spirit of previous generations including the “Incredibles” design team of Boeing lore who rapidly developed the 747.

“If you ever see a 777X wing you’d see that as groundbreaking” he said when asked if the company still had the ability to build a cutting-edge plane. “Because when you talk about a 90ft single-part wing spar made out of composites I count that as groundbreaking. So yes I have no lack of confidence in that at all.”

Hyslop is hiring 3000 new engineers and is hopeful that building “digital twins” or virtual-world replicas of aircraft will allow the company to make advances more quickly and bring in “revolutionary” improvements that could give it back a manufacturing edge. “It’s an extremely hard problem but it’s got extreme benefit” he said.

Boeing and Calhoun will have to show some improvements fast with clients and investors waiting for answers to existential questions. Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary last month said bosses were “not up to the job” – although his Lufthansa counterpart Carsten Spohr backed the company.

Aboulafia said: “What’s needed is leadership to get out of this to say we’ve got to move forward or we’ll get marginalised in the jetliner industry.”

A next-generation replacement of the Max could cost more than $25bn. On top of paying down the $45bn net debt it has built up during the crises and giving itself a cash buffer Boeing might be in need of $75bn Cunningham said. Boeing had done everything possible to avoid raising equity investment which would hurt existing shareholders but the analyst argued that new leaders with a long-term vision could pull it off and set the company on course for the next generation of air travel.

“You either fully commit or you eventually go out of business” Cunningham said. “Eventually can happen very quickly.”

The latest version of the planemaker's best-selling commercial aircraft the 737 MAX had been grounded for nine months following two fatal crashes and undeliverable finished aircraft were piling up around the factory with even employee parking lots at Boeing's Seattle-area facilities serving as storage space for the planes. The factory would need to take a breather until more space could be freed up.

After arguably the most intense scrutiny an aircraft type has ever undergone by regulators the 737 MAX was recertified by the FAA in December 2020. Since then even with the ongoing pandemic things have been quite different in Renton.

(Photo by David Ryder/Getty Images)

The MAX has become a workhorse aircraft in commercial fleets around the world. Since recertification more than 630 MAX aircraft in service with about 45 airlines have flown more than 1.5 million combined hours according to Boeing senior vice president Mike Flemming with over 600000 total flights operated.

Those numbers are likely to increase exponentially as Boeing makes an effort to scale up production of the aircraft to meet surging demand from airline and aircraft leasing customers.

Boeing is attempting to get production to a consistent rate of 31 new aircraft a month — down from a peak of 52 in April 2020 but a notable increase from depressed pandemic-era rates and a challenge given the labor shortages and supply chain disruption throughout the global economy.

TPG recently had a chance to tour the factory and see the production at work.

The Renton factory is where Boeing produces all of its narrow-body models including military derivatives such as the P-8 Poseidon a modified 737-800 that functions as a reconnaissance plane. In the past Boeing's also built the 707 727 and 757 in Renton.

More than 14500 commercial airplanes have been built in Renton.

We toured a few of the production lines not the entire factory and saw a few 737 MAX aircraft in different stages of completion.

The Renton factory is where the planes are assembled but the different components are built around the world. The fuselage for instance is built by Spirit Aerosystems in Witchita Kansas and shipped to Renton by train. Then Boeing workers join the wings tail engines and other parts of the plane before installing everything else like the control systems and wiring.

Production at Renton includes all models of the 737 MAX — the -8 the denser high-capacity -8-200 ordered by European low-cost carrier Ryanair the -9 and the two newer variants still undergoing FAA certification the smaller but higher-range -7 and the larger -10.

Notably we also saw a few planes destined for U.S. airlines. American United Southwest and Alaska all operate the MAX within the U.S. and during the tour we saw planes for all of them except American.

The day after the tour I flew to Phoenix for a one-on-one interview with Bob Jordan Southwest's CEO. Having seen several of his airline's planes being built the day before and knowing that Southwest is eagerly awaiting the 737 MAX 7 to be cleared by the FAA I asked Jordan about the planes.

He told me that as keen as the airline is on the smallest MAX jet the airline is working with Boeing to keep things flowing in the meantime. Among other things that's meant taking delivery of ordered 737 MAX 8 aircraft during delivery slots that had originally been intended for MAX 7 (Southwest will accept those MAX 7 jets once the plane is cleared during delivery slots originally scheduled for MAX 8 units).

""We stay really close to Boeing because the MAX is a great aircraft period 7 or 8"" Jordan said. ""Boeing is being a great partner.""

""We already have agreements into 2023 to [swap -7 and -8 deliveries]"" he added. ""Ultimately we'll get the -7 it's a great aircraft.""

It's not immediately clear when Boeing will reach its 31-per-month output nor when it will be able to scale up beyond that.

Regardless airlines continue to order the planes and await their new fleets.

Recently we already reported about our photoshoot of a unique line-up of the entire family of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft at the Boeing Seattle Delivery Center at Boeing Field.

One of the other highlights of this tour were visits to the Boeing Everett Factory and Boeing Renton Factory where the US aircraft manufacturer has its respective widebody and narrowbody final assembly lines.

Boeing Everett Factory

Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet

At the end of this year Boeing will close the final assembly line of its iconic Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet the ‘Queen of the Skies’. Hence this was our final opportunity to visit the Boeing 747 final assembly line and see a Jumbo Jet wearing the distinctive green protective coating in the world’s largest building by volume.

Boeing produces only one variant of the Jumbo Jet today: the Boeing 747-8F freighter. Over the last fifty years however many versions of the Jumbo Jet have been built including the best-selling Boeing 747-400 variant.

The final batch of four 747s will go to Atlas Air which ordered these four Boeing 747-8F freighter aircraft in order to operate flights between China and the United States on behalf of Alibaba logistics company Cainiao.

The first aircraft N860GT was delivered to Atlas Air on 2 June 2022. The Jumbo Jet we got to see during our 747 mezzanine and floor walk on the final assembly line was the third to last Boeing 747 to be built line number 1572. This aircraft will eventually be registered as N861GT. It is expected to be delivered in July 2022. The final Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet will be delivered to Atlas Air in November 2022. The images below clearly depict the green protective coating. Note also the yellow blocks to substitute for the weight of the engines that have not yet been installed.

After that the Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet final assembly line will be closed. It will definitely mark the end of an era not only for Boeing and its employees in the Boeing Everett Factory but probably also for the entire community near Seattle and aviation professionals and aviation geeks all over the world.

In total almost 1600 Jumbo Jets will have been built by Boeing over a timeframe that lasted for more than half a century. Fortunately the ‘Queen of the Skies’ will continue to fly for many years to come. Flying on a Boeing 747 as a passenger however is not easy these days as only a handful of airlines continue to operate one or more aircraft. At the moment of writing Lufthansa or Korean Air seem to be the safest bet if you want to fly a Boeing 747 as a passenger.

Boeing 777 / 777X

After visiting the Boeing 747 final assembly line we were invited to visit the final assembly line of another Boeing widebody aircraft: the Boeing 777. The best vantage point for overlooking this part of the massive Everett assembly hall was a balcony where also the general public used to get a glimpse of the aircraft manufacturing process during public tours which Boeing used to offer in the past. As a direct result of the corona pandemic however these public factory tours have been closed since March 2020. Boeing has not yet scheduled a re-opening date on their website and could not give us a re-opening date estimate either when we asked the question during our tour.

On the balcony we were kindly welcomed by Anna Gutierrez Boeing’s Vice President 777/777X Manufacturing. We got a magnificent view of the highly automated final assembly line which has no more fixed tooling. We could see several assembled and yet-to-be assembled Boeing 777 aircraft including a DHL Boeing 777F freighter with engines not yet installed and the front and aft fuselage sections of a Boeing 777F freighter which will eventually be assembled to become ‘Abigail’ the forty-seventh Boeing 777F freighter for FedEx. In the back of the final assembly hall we could observe some mid-fuselage sections with the wings already attached.

We also spotted a folding wingtip in the background one of the most distinctive features of the new Boeing 777X of which first deliveries have recently been delayed until 2025 as the US aircraft manufacturer does not expect to get the airplane fully certified before the end of 2024. Boeing has temporarily stopped production of the Boeing 777X through the end of 2023 freeing up much-needed final assembly line space to increase its Boeing 777F freighter production rate from two to three per month.

Next to the Boeing 777 / 777X final assembly line we could also get a glimpse of the former Boeing 787 Dreamliner final assembly line of the Boeing Everett Factory. The US aircraft manufactured stopped producing the Dreamliner in Everett in late February 2021 as it decided to consolidate Boeing 787 Dreamliner production in South Carolina. During our visit we spotted several Boeing 787 Dreamliners awaiting necessary modifications and inspections after some quality defects were discovered. Boeing is currently solving these issues together with the FAA. In the meantime the US aircraft manufacturer has stopped delivering Dreamliners. In fact it has not delivered a Dreamliner since May 2021. Boeing however expects that it will be able to resume Dreamliner deliveries this summer.

Boeing Renton Factory

Boeing 737 MAX

After the very interesting tour of the Boeing Everett Factory it was time to board our bus again and take the one-hour drive via Interstate 405 from Everett to Renton where Boeing has its 737 MAX final assembly line.

At the Boeing Renton Factory we were welcomed by Dennis Eng director 737 Program Business Operations. We got detailed information on how a Boeing 737 MAX is built and assembled in the Boeing Renton Factory.

There are a total of three assembly lines in Renton of which only two are currently in use. Boeing would like to increase Boeing 737 MAX production rates and is confident it will be able to eventually achieve a production rate of 31 aircraft per month.

Boeing 737 MAX fuselage sections are not built in Renton itself but in Wichita Kansas by Spirit AeroSystems. After the fuselages are produced they are transported by rail from Wichita to Renton. In Renton the fuselages wings landing gear and engines are joined and Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are fully assembled. Flight testing is done at Boeing Field.

The Boeing Renton Factory uses a three-shift system to build the Boeing 737 MAX. Moving Boeing 737 aircraft in the factory is a very critical operation so this is only done during one of the three shifts.

Three of the five variants of the Boeing 737 MAX family are fully certified and flying for various airlines all across the world: the Boeing 737 MAX 8 the Boeing 737 MAX 8200 (a modified version of the -8 with additional seats) and the Boeing 737 MAX 9.

The smallest and the largest variant of the family the Boeing 737 MAX 7 and Boeing 737 MAX 10 have not yet been certified. The US aircraft manufacturer is on a tight deadline however as it needs to get the certification done before the end of the year. If the Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft is not certified before the end of the year it will need to meet new crew alert requirements as defined in the US ‘Aircraft Safety and Certification Reform Act’ unless it gets a waiver extension. The new criteria might result in loss of cockpit commonality between the different Boeing 737 MAX variants additional training costs for the airlines and increased operating costs.

Boeing could not give a detailed timeline for the certification but it is working closely with the FAA and according to Mike Fleming senior Vice President 737 MAX Return to Service Commercial Customer Support and Commercial Derivatives Lead at Boeing Commercial Airplanes the US aircraft manufacturer has hired hundreds of engineers to focus on the certification work.

As we walked through the final assembly hall we could observe many Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in various stages of production. We spotted several Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 MAX aircraft an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX an Air China Boeing 737 MAX a fully painted United Airlines Boeing 737 MAX and a Boeing 737 MAX for FlyDubai.

We concluded our tour of the Boeing Renton Factory and thanked Dennis Eng and his colleagues for the tour and made our way back to the bus that would take us back to our hotel.

We would like to thank the Boeing Company for offering Aviation24.be the unique opportunity to visit the Boeing Everett Factory and Boeing Renton Factory.

Developed by quattro GmbH a.k.a. Audi Sport GmbH the RS 4 Avant entered production five years after the assembly line for the RS 2 Avant came to a halt.

Codenamed B5 the first-generation RS 4 was unveiled to much critical acclaim at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1999. Production started in May 2000 continuing through September 2001. Audi delivered just over 6000 examples of the breed. Circa 500 were finished in right-hand drive.110 kilograms heavier than the S4 at 1620 kilograms (3571 pounds) the RS 4 Avant is rocking a pressed steel platform with pressed steel body panels. The 62-liter (nearly 16.4-gallon) fuel tank of the A4 is located under the rear seats feeding a twin-turbocharged V6 with a 90-degree angle between the cylinder banks. Although it’s based on the bi-turbo sixer of the S4 the 2.7-liter mill features a lot of Cosworth Technology bits and bobs.Owned by MAHLE since 2005 the Brits gifted this lump with enlarged intake and exhaust ports a pair of side-mounted intercoolers and beefier turbochargers in the guise of BorgWarner K04s. By comparison the S4 employs K03s. The aluminum cylinder heads developed by Cosworth Technology sit atop cast iron for the block. A redesigned exhaust system and Bosch Motronic engine management need to be highlighted as well.Bosch also supplied the multipoint sequential injection and drive-by-wire throttle. The longitudinally-mounted powerplant further differs from the 2.7 in the S4 by means of a special oil pump designed to prevent starvation while cornering. And oh by the way this engine is fitted with five valves per cylinder just like the aurally pleasing Ferrari F355 midship sports car.As expected of such a specialized powerplant many internals are different from the powerplant of the S4. Even the compression ratio was lowered from 9.3:1 to 9.0:1 due to the K04 turbos mentioned earlier this fellow produces 375 horsepower at 7000 revolutions per minute and 325 pound-feet (440 Nm) from 2500 through 6000 revolutions per minute. By comparison the naturally-aspirated boxer of the Porsche 911 Carrera from that period makes do with 296 horsepower and 258 pound-feet (350 Nm) of torque.Somewhat bizarre compared to modern-day RennSport models the B5 Audi RS 4 Avant is equipped with a good ol’ manual transmission instead of aor a torque-converter auto. The six-speed box works together with a center diff to deliver up to 75 percent of the available torque to whichever axle needs it the most. The Torsen-type quattro permanent all-wheel-drive system usually sends 50 percent up front and 50 percent to the rear axle.Wider both fore and aft compared to the already sporty S4 the RS 4 dons 18- by 8.5-inch wheels featuring a nine-spoke design. Behind them you’ll find two-piston brake calipers and 360-millimeter brake discs up front joined by single-piston calipers and 312-millimeter discs for the rear axle.The optional winter-spec wheels are marginally narrower at 7.5 inches. Optional extras further include a sunroof wood accents for the cockpit Nappa leather a sunroof Alcantara for the steering wheel and gear knob and bucket seats. When it comes to suspension componentry MacPherson struts are fitted up front whereas the rear end is a double-wishbone setup.Decidedly prettier than the sportiest variants of the E36 BMW 3 Series Touring and W202 Mercedes-Benz C-Class the B5 Audi RS 4 Avant was originally fitted with xenon high-intensity discharge headlights. The longitudinal roof rails could be specified in silver or black and the good peeps in Ingolstadt didn’t cut any corners in terms of standard equipment.Leather? Check! Air conditioning? Check again! Heated seats? Of course! Electric windows for everyone? Well duh! Dressed in finely perforated leather the beautifully minimalist three-spoke steering wheel of the first-generation RS 4 Avant frames an 8000-rpm tachometer and a 310-kph speedometer. Make that 200 mph if we’re dealing with a UK-spec vehicle.Never sold in the United States of America the German superwagon reaches 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour) in just under five clicks. Top speed is limited to 250 kilometers per hour (155 miles per hour) which is good enough for a car that seats five and the family dog.For some reason or another Audi couldn’t make a case for the RS 4 Avant on the B6 platform. The Ingolstadt-based automaker wouldn’t let BMW M and Mercedes-have their way for too long though because the RS 4 Avant returned in 2006 with a free-breathing flat-plane crankshaft V8.

The gathering dubbed “New York Forever: A Celebration of Our City” was REBNY’s first such gathering since 2019. The event honored TF Cornerstone’s Tom Elghanayan Fetner Properties’ Hal Fetner CBRE’s Darcy Stacom Douglaston Development’s Jeff Levine and the Gotham Organization’s David Picket among others.

Attendees paying $1400 a ticket mingled and nibbled on small plates served up by chefs such as Daniel Boulud Michael Lomonaco and J.J. Johnson. The edibles and the come-as-you-are dress code were a far cry from the stuffy mid-winter black-tie affairs at the New York Hilton.

So was the setting on the sixth floor of Glasshouse which has large windows and an open outdoor deck — that guests had to flee when a brief rain spritz popped up.

Guests included executive committee members Douglas Durst CBRE’s Mary Ann Tighe JLL’s Bob Knakal Cushman & Wakefield’s Bruce Mosler SL Green’s Laura Jackson and Boston Property’s Hilary Spann. We also spotted Marcus & Millichap’s Eric Anton Branton Realty’s Woody Heller Cushman’s Joanne Podell and RXR Realty’s Scott Rechler and Frank Pusinelli and the Rent Stabilization Association’s Frank P. Ricci.

Boulud who supervised menu offerings including citrus-marinated shrimp and sweet corn veloute from his Le Pavillon mingled with happy guests in his chef’s whites.

It wasn’t all about food and fun. My colleague Lois Weiss reports that Gov. Kathy Hochul met privately with REBNY officials to discuss conversion of old office buildings to housing and the cancellation of the 421a tax abatement program.

Eric Adams’ chief advisor Ingrid Lewis-Martin came in the mayor’s stead because Adams had to deal with the case of a police officer who was shot earlier that day.

Although the event was filled with laughter and optimism a few guests complained that the roam-the-floor format made it hard to enjoy the dishes. “There was no place to put dishes down except for some tiny table stands” said one. “For $1400 a ticket I want a place to sit down.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9ob3VzaW5nLW1hcmtldC1hbmQtaG9tZS1wcmljZS1ib29tLW1hZGUtYmlnZ2VyLWJ5LWludmVzdG9ycy1hbmQtd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investors—including Wall Street—helped to drive up home prices during the Pandemic Housing Boom. Here's the proof,"Text messages. Mailers. Cold calls. Over the past two years homeowners have been bombarded with inquiries from investors who want to know one thing: Are they open to selling their property?

Since the onset of the Pandemic Housing Boom investors have flooded the U.S. housing market. There are small players like mom-and-pop landlords and Airbnb hosts who are adding to their property portfolios. Home flippers returned with vengeance. There’s also the Wall Street types like Blackstone and iBuyer players like Opendoor Technologies that are gobbling up homes. The combination of low mortgage rates easy access to capital and record home appreciation was all too enticing for investors to pass up on.

However even as investors piled into the housing market many real estate insiders over the past two years hesitated to attribute much if any of the boom to investors. In their view numerous factors drove the housing frenzy. Historically low mortgage rates spurred by the Federal Reserve’s response to the COVID-19 recession attracted all types of buyers. That included white-collar professionals who saw their jobs transition to remote during the pandemic and were eager to ditch apartments in places like San Francisco and Boston for homes in markets like Boise and Tampa. The pandemic also coincided with the five-year window (between 2019 and 2023) when millennials born during the generation’s five largest birth years (between 1989 and 1993) would hit the peak first-time homebuying age of 30. That elevated demand simply overwhelmed the supply side: Housing inventory which was already trending downward before the pandemic struck fell to a 40-year low during the boom.

But that hesitation to name investors as one of the pillars of the Pandemic Housing Boom is no longer necessary. It’s now abundantly clear that investors did indeed help accelerate the housing boom and drive up U.S. home prices. At least that’s what Fortune concluded after looking over recent data published by Redfin Freddie Mac and the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.

In the first quarter of 2022 investors made up a record 28% of single-family home sales according to a report published last week by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. That’s up from 19% in the first quarter of 2021. It’s also far above the 16% that investors made up of single-family home sales between 2017 and 2019. (To conduct the analysis the Harvard researchers analyzed home sale data collected by CoreLogic.)

The investor bull rush into the housing market was the most pronounced in fast-growing markets in the U.S. South and West according to the Harvard researchers. That finding is backed up by a separate Redfin analysis which looked at all home sales (unlike Harvard’s single-family homes analysis). In the first quarter of 2022 investors made up a staggering 33.1% of home sales in Atlanta. Not far behind was Jacksonville (32.3%) Charlotte (32.3%) Phoenix (29.0%) and Miami (28.2%). Those same markets are also among the nation’s most “overvalued” housing markets that are at risk of seeing a home price decline according to Moody’s Analytics.

While markets in the South and West saw the most investor activity almost every major U.S. housing market saw an uptick. Among the 31 large markets analyzed by Redfin 29 saw an uptick in investor activity. Look no further than Ohio which saw the share of investor homes sales jump in Cincinnati (up 2.9 percentage points) Cleveland (up 3.1 percentage points) and Columbus (up 7 percentage points). Between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 only Seattle (down 0.5 percentage point) and Milwaukee (down 0.1 percentage point) saw a decline in the share of home sales attributed to investors.

Researchers at Freddie Mac who did their own analysis of public records found a more modest jump in investor purchases than Harvard and Redfin researchers. Between December 2019 and December 2021 Freddie Mac found investor home purchases climbed from 26.7% to 27.6%. However Freddie Mac acknowledges its analysis isn’t fully capturing all-cash purchases by investors.

Let’s be clear: The vast majority of investor home purchases in America are still made by small or midsize investors: ranging from average Joes owning an Airbnb rental to individuals who’ve spent years amassing a hefty portfolio of rentals. According to the Harvard study 74% of investor purchases in September were made by investors with portfolios of less than 100 properties. The remaining 26% of investor purchases were made by groups with property portfolios of at least 100 units.

That said it’s clear that those big investors were among the biggest drivers of the uptick in investor purchases.

“Investors with large portfolios (at least 100 properties) drove much of this growth nearly doubling their share of investor purchases from 14% in September 2020 to 26% in September 2021” wrote the Harvard researchers. “By buying up single-family homes investors have reduced the already limited supply available to potential owner-occupants particularly first-time and moderate-income buyers.”

Who are these big investors? Some are massive rental companies like Invitation Homes—the nation's largest owner of single-family rental homes—which grew its portfolio during the pandemic. Blackstone which founded Invitation Homes back in 2012 also got back into the single-family home business during the pandemic. (In 2019 Blackstone had backed away from the business after selling its remaining shares of Invitation Homes.)

The Pandemic Housing Boom also saw a surge on the iBuying side of the market. These iBuyers—including firms like Opendoor Offerpad RedfinNow and Zillow Offers—went around the country making swift offers to home sellers. The companies would then quickly put the home back on the market. It's less of a traditional ""home flip"" and more of a volume play: On each sale iBuyers net a ""service fee"" that the firm charges the buyer in exchange for the speedy transaction.

As the housing boom took hold it saw Zillow’s earnings initially soar—with the real estate site posting a record $52 million profit in the first quarter of 2021. That fed Zillow’s iBuyer confidence as it quickly grew its home buying business to over three-fourths of its total revenues. Of course Zillow's home flipping business would go on to implode in epic fashion last fall. But only after Zillow’s much-lauded algorithm overpaid analysts tell Fortune for thousands of U.S. homes.

But most housing investors are still groups you’ve likely never heard of. The Opendoor and Blackstones of the world at least for now are still a small piece of the investor pie.

“While large corporate investors are rapidly rising as a share of the market and are likely to expand they remain so small that their market share only has a modest impact on the overall percentage of investors” wrote Freddie Mac researchers earlier this month. During the pandemic iBuyer and institutional buyers have jumped from around a 1.5% market share of purchases to around 4.5% according to Freddie Mac.

It's intellectually dishonest to pin soaring U.S. home prices—which are up 37% over the past two years—on any one company. However when you step back and examine the elevated demand that has come from the investor side of the market it's clear they've attributed at least in some degree to soaring home prices. Investors both big and small gobbled up a larger market share during the pandemic. The impact of elevated investor demand also goes beyond the homes they actually bought. Even when investors are on the losing side of a bidding war from an economic lens at least they are still putting upward pressure on prices.

As the Pandemic Housing Boom implodes amid spiked mortgage rates it raises the question: Is the investor rush into the housing market a temporary feature of the pandemic or the start of a lasting trend?

While spiked mortgage rates are pricing out many first-time buyers it's also seeing investors pull back from the market. Surging mortgage rates change the math for investors: The added costs means many investors would take on mortgage payments that are greater than they can charge for rent.

“Investor home purchases are falling for the same reason overall home purchases are falling: Surging interest rates and high housing prices have made it more expensive to get a mortgage and buy a home” wrote Sheharyar Bokhari a senior economist at Redfin in a report published this month. “While roughly three-quarters of investor purchases are made with cash investors are still impacted by interest rates because they often take out loans to get that cash.”

Sunday more than 100000 people gathered on Hennepin Avenue to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the event. They were embraced by some of Minnesota's largest employers as well as a group of Democratic heavyweights who welcomed the crowds with a plea for political action in response to recent moves that they said threaten the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community.

Several pre-parade speakers denounced the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade noting that Justice Clarence Thomas proclaimed that the legal rationale for banning abortion should be used to overturn cases establishing rights to contraception same-sex consensual relations and same-sex marriage. The speakers urged attendees to get out and vote this fall for people who support their causes.

""They are coming for equality"" said Gov. Tim Walz who also marched in the parade next to Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan. ""They are coming for all of our rights. The good news is there's more of us. … The antidote to what we saw on Friday is you. It is all of our responsibility to create a world where every single child is seen heard loved and valued. Minnesota is that place.""

Andrea Jenkins president of the Minneapolis City Council warned the crowd that more than 300 anti-LGBTQ laws have been introduced throughout the U.S. recently with more than 100 of them passing in various states. She said conservatives are trying to legislate the LGBTQ community ""out of societal existence.""

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said the LGBTQ community has shown that it has political muscle of its own.

""Fifty years ago did we think we were going to have gay marriage? We did not"" Klobuchar told the crowd. ""Did we think we were going to get rid of things like 'Don't ask don't tell'? We did not. We have made so much progress. … This is a celebration of 50 years of progress but it is also a call for action for 50 more.""

Many crowd members said they welcomed the intrusion of politics on a day devoted to spreading messages of love inclusion and acceptance.

Pam Burd who has been coming to the Pride parade for 20 years said it was important for state leaders to show support for the LGBTQ community.

""I'm pretty disturbed by recent events"" said Burd who identifies as a gay woman. ""And I don't know what our future is. So I think our leaders need to be involved in everything that's going on.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was the most energetic politician on hand jogging down the route in shorts and pumping up the crowd outside Rock Bottom Brewery. In a call-and-responses session Frey shouted ""Happy!"" and the jubilant crowd shouted back ""Pride!""

Same-sex couples exchanged kisses and hugs sometimes on the route itself. The Timberwolves mascot drew huge cheers with his dance routine to Aretha Franklin's ""Respect."" The crowd also went delirious for bubbles and people sang along to a variety of hits.

""It was awesome"" said Tasia Desjarlait who brought her four kids to the parade for the first time. ""I feel great because the people going to the parade today feel free.""

Police said turnout was as large as before the pandemic. They reported no arrests or incidents related to the parade though a group of about 100 anti-police protesters briefly disrupted the beginning of the parade as they chanted ""No police at Pride"" and ""No justice no peace."" The group quickly moved to Loring Park organizers said.

The parade was an entertaining spectacle that lasted slightly more than two hours. Though it did not reach Mardi Gras levels there was a lot of exposed skin even though the weather never topped 70 degrees. One marcher wore nothing but a pair of white jockey shorts as he gyrated down Hennepin Avenue.

Still the parade was a fairly family-friendly event. Madusa Rose set up a face-painting station at 9th and Hennepin treating about 40 children to a free butterfly or other design. Rainbows symbolizing the LGBTQ flag were everywhere: on socks shirts capes dresses suits beads dogs — even rainbow-dyed hair.

Pat Meyer brought his three kids to the parade from St. Louis Park for the first time this year saying he did it to support his 13-year-old daughter who recently told the family she identifies as ""pansexual.""

""It opens up a lot of dialogues for us"" Meyer said while his two younger sons showed off their rainbow-colored gear. ""It's important for them to see there are no limitations to who you are.""

The parade drew some of Minnesota's biggest companies. A crew from Cargill carried signs saying ""We don't give a moo who you love"" and ""Labels are for jars not people."" Xcel Energy marched under a banner saying ""You. Us. Together."" Aveda workers wore T-shirts saying ""Be you. Do you.""

There were also two marching bands and representatives from Target Delta Air Lines Wells Fargo General Mills Ikea U.S. Bank Boston Scientific 3M C.H. Robinson Walgreens Ameriprise Financial Cub Foods Pizza Luce and the Minnesota Twins and Timberwolves among others.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The newly approved indication extends to patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified including DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma; high-grade B-cell lymphoma; primary mediastinal LBCL; and grade 3B follicular lymphoma. Disease could be refractory to or relapsing within 12 months of frontline chemoimmunotherapy or relapsed/refractory to chemoimmunotherapy and ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

“Breyanzi represents a remarkable advance over a nearly 30-year standard of care providing significantly improved efficacy with a well-established safety profile” Manali Kamdar MD associate professor and clinical director of Lymphoma Services Division of Hematology Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation at the University of Colorado Cancer Center said in a press release. “This important milestone reinforces the benefit of offering a CAR T-cell therapy option to patients earlier in their treatment journey and it’s critical that we begin the work to implement this therapy into standard practice as a second-line treatment in order to help improve outcomes for more patients.”

The approval is based on the phase 3 TRANSFORM trial (NCT03575351)2 in which patients treated with liso-cel had statistically significant improvement in event-free survival (EFS) compared with the standard of care (SOC). The median EFS in the liso-cel arm (n = 92) was 10.1 months (95% CI 6.1–not reached [NR]) vs 2.3 months (95% CI 2.2-4.3) in the SOC arm (n = 92; HR 0.349; 95% CI 0.229-0.530; P <.0001). At 6 months the EFS rates were 63.3% (95% CI 52.0%-74.7%) and 33.4% (95% CI 23.0%-43.8%) and at 12-months were 44.5% (95% CI 29.4%-59.6%) and 23.7% (95% CI 13.4%-34.1%) in the liso-cel and SOC arms respectively.

The objective response rate in the liso-cel arm was 86% (95% CI 77.0%-92.3%) vs 48% (95% CI 37.3%-58.5%) in the SOC arm. Those treated with liso-cel had a complete response rate of 66% (95% CI 55.7%-75.8%; P <.0001) vs 39% (95% CI 13.4%-34.1%) in the SOC arm (P <.0001).

The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 14.8 months (95% CI 6.6-NR) in the liso-cel arm compared with 5.7 months (95% CI 3.9-9.4) in the SOC arm (HR 0.406; 95% CI 0.250-0.659; P = .0001).

Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse effects (TEAEs) in the liso-cel arm included neutropenia (80%) anemia (49%) thrombocytopenia (49%) and lymphopenia (25%). In 48% of patients in both arms serious TEAEs were identified. Any-grade cytokine release syndrome was observed in 49 patients in the liso-cel arm with a median time to onset of 5 days and a median time to resolution of 4 days.

Of 232 patients who were screened 184 received leukapheresis and were randomized 1:1. At the time of data reporting 78 patients were continuing treatment in the liso-cel arm vs 32 in the SOC. Fifty patients crossed over from the SOC arm to receive liso-cel with 46 ultimately receiving CAR T-cell therapy as their third-line treatment.

At data cut-off the median follow-up for the liso-cel and SOC cohorts was 6.2 months. Patients included in the analysis underwent leukapheresis and then randomization with the liso-cel arm receiving 100 x 106 CAR T cells and the SOC arm having 3 cycles of salvage therapy then high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation.

Posted online on June 26 2022 Published in The Evansville Courier & Press",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYmlvdGVjaC5ldS9tZW1iZXJzL2Jpb3RlY2gtc3RhcnR1cC1waXRjaC1pbnZlc3RvcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Pitch Your Biotech Startup to a Life Sciences Investor,"You’ve got the idea. You’ve got the science. You’ve got the team. Now all you need is the money but that can be a tricky step for a new biotech entrepreneur.

In any field getting in front of the right investors is a challenge of its own. Once you’re pitching experienced investors and entrepreneurs say it’s important to be prepared clear adaptive and patient.

According to Nancy Stagliano CEO and Executive Chair at the US-based biotech startup Neuron23 the first key is clarity. “Tell a clear and succinct story that appeals to the investment thesis of the investors you’re pitching to.” This means articulating a clear ask–which sounds simple. “But for a lot of people who don’t have much experience it’s daunting to say ‘I need a lead investor I need $25 million I need three investors.’”

Stagliano is a serial entrepreneur. She started as the co-founder and CEO of CytomX Therapeutics next helming iPierian through its acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb and then running the iPierian spinout True North Therapeutics. From her pitching experience she learned a few key lessons about what investors are looking for.

For example platform biotech companies can have a broad exciting vision but that doesn’t sell a company on its own. “You need to provide to investors that killer application” she says. “What are you asking for money to do? Which problem are you really solving? I don’t think in my first round that I realized how important it was to be crystal clear.”

Unlike other sectors Stagliano says “healthcare investors have the benefit of very clear milestones. If you can align your ask with showing them that timeline what it costs to get to milestone X it just puts everything into context for them.”

It’s important to articulate how to reach those inflection points says Lucio Iannone VP of Investment for Leaps by Bayer. “What gets me is the vision of what’s going to happen in the next five years.” This can be a specific funding round or an exit strategy. “If you already have a picture of the company usually I can see that you are thinking three moves ahead. This is exactly the skill I’m looking for in a CEO.”

Michael Gilman CEO of Arrakis Therapeutics and another serial entrepreneur behind Stromedix Padlock Therapeutics and Obsidian Therapeutics says it helps to understand where investors are coming from. “I think that the most important thing I’ve learned about investors over the years which I wish someone had simply explained to me on day one is that they are trying to invest each new dollar at a lower risk than the previous one.”

So while you are articulating your value proposition be clear about the risks around your underlying assumptions and have a plan to discharge each one. “With each risk you take off the table the closer you get to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and you build value which enables you to raise the next chunk of capital at lower cost.”

This isn’t always in the wheelhouse for company founders says Stephan Christgau Founding Partner at EIR Ventures. Particularly for new entrepreneurs they tend to fall back on their area of expertise. “Founders are very often academic and they love talking about the science. The science is important but it can be a drag if you have 40 slides out of 50 that are filled with data.”

When founders keep pitches in their own comfort zones it can give VCs the impression that the team is ill-prepared. “You need to come across as having command of the whole area and be able to answer questions” Christgau says. That doesn’t mean they need to know everything: “It is fair to answer ‘this hasn’t been studied’ but do it in a convincing way. And if every answer is ‘I don’t know’ – it’s a problem.”

Inflexibility can also hint that the entrepreneur has a fundamental misunderstanding of the kind of relationship investors are looking for. Biotech investors are typically looking for more than just a financial transaction and want to work with companies who value their insights. “There’s nothing worse than having someone just read slides to you someone who’s not really responding to the conversation or the uniqueness of a particular investor or group” Stagliano says. “The more you can make that pitch a conversation the better.”

“You’re asking not just for their money but their experience” she added. “If you have good investors around the table they’ll benefit you in ways beyond that initial investment. Investors will respect you if you ask them good questions. They’ll say ‘this person wants to collaborate.’”

Stagliano says before even reaching out founders should do some homework on the investors. Do they have a broad focus on therapeutics over diagnostics? Do they invest in multiple companies within a specialty or bet on just one from each? Do they invest in early or late-stage companies?

Entrepreneurs can make a good impression when they shape their pitch to the situation says Christgau. “Try to find where the interest is for the investor what they are really asking about.” This can demonstrate a deep knowledge about the project that investors like to see.

Iannone says this reflects a strong quality for a first-time CEO: the ability to listen to feedback. Many scientific founders come directly from a PhD or postdoc with an idea and a strong vision. “Others say ‘we are looking for the right investors to help us achieve this.’ I really appreciate it when they are open to feedback and suggestions and in a very scientific way get the data from other sources and make their own decision. That’s a beautiful thing to see.”

A demonstrable understanding of the competitive landscape inspires confidence too Stagliano says. “Investors love to hear you say ‘I know there’s competition but this is how we’re different.’ Articulate the problem show where you fit and how your solution is differentiated from others. And then have it be a real honest conversation about what you know and what you don’t know.”

Christgau says the failure to map out the landscape is a common mistake. “You need to say ‘our approach is for this particular subset of patients and it’s better than three or four other projects in development.’ Have an awareness of what else is being developed and put your project into the context of that.”

That kind of insight may require outside expertise. Christgau says first-time founders especially in Europe can struggle to stretch beyond their bubble. “Successful entrepreneurs realize they have to reach out and engage talent wherever it may be – whether it’s Bombay Boston or Berlin. But we don’t always see that.”

The types of advisors a team chooses can say a lot about them he added. Even at a company’s very early stages that can include dialogue with potential buyers to get a sense of what they would want to see. This can help guide the types of animal studies the company ought to carry out in order to provide results that are relevant to the major actors in a field.

It’s often a challenge for new entrepreneurs to remember that there’s a range of investors with different motivations and backgrounds. Finding investors is at least in part an exercise in matchmaking.

For example Leaps by Bayer is guided less by the drive for profit than traditional VC’s and more by a mission to back ventures that attempt major breakthroughs in its areas of interest. This has led to some clear mismatches from entrepreneurs who didn’t do their homework before a pitch says Iannone. “We had one company that said ‘we’re going to make a lot of money.’ But we are impact investors. If you’re purely for financial gain we may not have a fit in your strategy.”

Iannone pointed to eGenesis a biotech using genome engineering to develop transplantable human organs which Leaps backed after a pitch that focused on the urgent needs of patients awaiting kidney transplants. “It really touches you when you see the CEO is not there just to make a quick buck and go.”

Stagliano learned when pitching CytomX how differently investors can view the same issue. She landed two investor meetings on the same day seeking what her team thought was a modest amount. “The first investor said ‘wow that’s a very rich ask for a company at your stage. Can’t you do it for less?’” In the second meeting however “the investor said ‘that doesn’t seem like enough money. We can’t invest in anything that only gets you halfway.’”

“Different people look at different things” says Christgau. “Some investors are very science-oriented. Some are development-oriented. Some invest very much in people – the team becomes the most dominating piece of the puzzle.”

“Investors are evaluating the management team so it’s critical to develop rapport and trust from the beginning” adds Gilman.

Part of building that trust comes from transparency. “Entrepreneurs really should highlight potential issues” says Iannone. If he gets the sense a CEO is trying to hide potential issues it’s usually a red flag. “Say it up front: ‘this is the risky part this is how we’re going to mitigate it.’ And we can help. We are in life sciences we know that 90% of these won’t get into patients.”

Stagliano learned that lesson early. “You’re selling a vision an opportunity. You’re selling yourself as an entrepreneur. But there is such a thing as overpromising. That’s where you have to try to strike that balance — being authentic and credible but recognizing that you’re selling something. For scientists it’s sometimes hard to do that.”

Experience is often the best teacher. “You have to kiss a lot of frogs” Stagliano says. “Talk to a lot of investors understand what’s resonating continue to iterate your pitch. There’s no dishonor in casting a wide net especially at the beginning. And don’t take ‘no’ personally – there’s usually a sweet spot that you find after you’ve talked to a handful of investors.”",,,,,,

The elite schools took $10 million from 2017 to 2023 from entities within the “State of Palestine” according to the analysis by Open the Books a Republican-owned nonprofit dedicated to revealing government spending.

Brown University Harvard University and non-Ivy Indiana University of Pennsylvania are among the schools to accept funding from donors located in the nation that technically doesn’t exist at least by UN standards.

The “State of Palestine” is not a recognized entity by the United Nations or the US — though some 140 countries do officially recognize it.

3 Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Palestinians who have long been fighting for recognized statehood live in the Israel-occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank which are controlled by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority respectively.

Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from a foundation located within the “State of Palestine” to create a professorship in Palestinian Studies as part of the college’s Middle East Studies program according to federal disclosures reviewed by Open the Books.

Though the financial filing does not disclose the donor’s name Brown previously said the money was gifted by the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Nine different donors — including multiple Brown alumni and the foundation — came together to fund the “Mahmoud Darwish Professorship in Palestinian Studies” according to a 2020 press release.

Meanwhile Harvard took in $1.6 million from donors within the “State of Palestine” and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania received $6.4 million from entities within the “State of Palestine” and another $900000 from a donor from “Palestinian Territory Occupied” according to the review of the financial disclosure documents.

The donors are not identified in the filings. Harvard previously said that monies it received from Palestinian donors in 2017 2018 and 2019 did not come from the Palestinian Authority though the Ivy League would not disclose the donor names in a 2020 news report.

Most of the money helped pay for Palestinian students from the occupied territories to receive an education at American universities according to the filings.

They were often reported as “payment of tuition and fees for students from Palestine. Funds are also utilized to pay for educational-related expenses incurred by the university for these students through their enrollment in this program” the documents state according to Open the Books.

Indiana University of Pennsylvania received at least $2.3 million from the West Bank-based Arab American University to cover the tuition and other expenses for Palestinian students attending the US college according to the same 2020 report.

In addition to the funding the US universities have had ongoing relationships with universities in the West Bank.

Brown’s inaugural professor of Palestinian Studies Beshara Doumani was granted permission to simultaneously serve as the president of Birzeit University in the West Bank for two years.

The Palestinian university was criticized after its Union of Professors and Employees penned an op-ed days after Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack stating “2023 will be recorded historically as the year that Palestinians stood boldly in the face of colonial fascism and screamed in defense of their homes humanity and lives.”

For its part Indiana University of Pennsylvania offers business Ph.D. and master’s programs in partnership with Arab American University.

During her confirmation hearing in 2022 Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson introduced herself to Congress as an originalist. This surprising move from a presumptively liberal justice signified to many the triumph of originalism as the accepted methodology of the Supreme Court. Jackson was following in the footsteps of Justice Elena Kagan who famously declared that “we are all originalists now” during her own confirmation.

Kagan however came to regret that quip after watching her conservative colleagues implement a series of GOP policy preferences in the name of applying the Constitution’s “original” meaning which is what originalism claims to be. She is surely not the only progressive with second thoughts: The legal left’s embrace of originalism was a major influential development in the 12 years between Kagan’s and Jackson’s elevation to the court—one that’s arguably waning today despite Jackson’s appointment. After three terms of precedent-smashing activism by the Supreme Court’s 6–3 conservative supermajority almost always under the banner of originalism the methodology looks more intellectually bankrupt manipulable and dangerous than ever.

Some liberals have responded with accusations that this supermajority peddles “fauxriginalism” cherry-picking history to fit Republicans’ favored results. This allegation is certainly true but doesn’t answer the underlying question: Is it even a good idea to concede that the “original meaning” of the Constitution—even if it could be reliably ascertained—is the authoritative one? Jackson’s approach illustrates the benefits and risks of trying to beat originalists at their own game from the left. And with each passing term the payoff looks smaller and smaller.

For progressives the problems begin with the origin of the theory. Conservative scholars politicians and activists developed the idea of originalism in response to Brown v. Board of Education—yes the decision that desegregated public school—arguing that the Framers of the 14th Amendment would never have intended to integrate public education. They may have been right about that claim: The same Congress that proposed the 14th Amendment in 1866 segregated the District of Columbia’s public schools while a supermajority of states that ratified the amendment also strictly separated education by race. That doesn’t mean the push toward integration was the wrong move for our country and our 20th-century understanding of what equal rights ought to mean legally. Regardless in the coming decades the burgeoning conservative legal movement refined and pushed the theory to combat other contested Supreme Court decisions including Roe v. Wade Griswold v. Connecticut (birth control) Miranda v. Arizona (self-incrimination) Reynolds v. Sims (malapportionment) and Regents v. Bakke (affirmative action).

Today originalism is the house style of the Federalist Society the lavishly funded network of conservative lawyers who provide intellectual cover for the Republican Party’s preferred policies. It’s propounded to some degree by all six conservative justices who have placed it at the center of their continual smash-and-grab campaign against progressive precedent. When the Supreme Court overruled Roe its justification boiled down to a single claim: Abortion was largely illegal when the 14th Amendment was ratified so it may still be criminalized today. When the court established a new right to carry guns in public it deployed the same reasoning: People could allegedly carry guns in public when the Second Amendment was ratified so they have a right to do so today. And when the court struck down affirmative action? Same story: The original meaning of the equal protection clause requires the law to be “colorblind” the court declared.

This last decision gave Jackson an opportunity to flaunt her skills as a progressive originalist as did an earlier case designed to gut the Voting Rights Act’s remnants. In both she delivered: The justice drew heavily upon the work of historians like Eric Foner who reject the “colorblind” conception of the 14th Amendment in favor of a nuanced interpretation that allows for “race-conscious” remedies to protect minorities’ equal citizenship. Jackson pitched this theory in a lengthy monologue during oral arguments in the voting rights case—her second day on the bench—as if to warn her conservative colleagues that their bogus originalism would no longer go unchallenged. And perhaps her shaming strategy worked since the court ultimately delivered an unlikely victory for the Voting Rights Act.

Jackson’s approach here echoed the work of advocacy groups that seek to employ originalism for progressive ends most prominently the well-respected Constitutional Accountability Center. The goal here is to engage with conservative judges on their own turf demonstrating that their own methodology would actually yield a liberal result if they did it honestly. In short these advocates try to out-originalist the originalists. And on select topics the tactic can work marvels. Race is one example since the conservative fixation with a “colorblind” Constitution so obviously contradicts the historical record. Federal power is another since the Framers clearly gave Congress sweeping powers to regulate commerce. (That’s why Jackson’s most important majority opinion so far is an originalist defense of Congress’ ability to create private rights through its spending power.) Many protections for criminal defendants too like the right to trial by jury and the guarantee against self-incrimination have strong historical foundations.

Other liberties treasured by progressives however do not end up saved by progressive originalism. The Supreme Court’s historical analysis in Dobbs may have been sloppy and inaccurate but that doesn’t change the fact that there’s no evidence Americans thought the 14th Amendment safeguarded abortion back in the 1860s when it was written. Selectively deploying originalism when it bolsters progressive aims does not solve the underlying problem: that as Hawaii Supreme Court Justice Todd Eddins has put it the theory champions the views of “the few white men who made laws and shaped lives during the mostly racist and misogynistic very old days.” This flaw may be most pronounced in cases involving the civil rights of those whom the authors of the Constitution scorned or ignored.

Consider for instance a group of people who were excluded from the political process—indeed from public life—when the 14th Amendment was ratified: women. Sex equality is rooted in the amendment’s equal protection clause which became law in 1868. During this period though in most of the country women had virtually no rights at all. Married women could not own property sign contracts or file lawsuits under the doctrine of “coverture” which subsumed their legal identity into that of their husband. Men could legally beat their wives under the doctrine of chastisement which allowed for “moderate” physical violence in the home. As one court put it in 1868 while upholding the acquittal of a man who whipped his wife the judiciary could “not interfere with family government in trifling cases.” (This history suddenly became relevant when the lower courts struck down a law barring domestic abusers from possessing firearms.)

Conservative litigants are not even shy about citing this evidence when defending discriminatory laws. South Carolina placed it front and center when arguing for same-sex marriage bans in 2015. The state cited congressional debates over the 14th Amendment’s impact on coverture laws that denied women equal citizenship. At the time of the amendment’s adoption some congressmen fretted that the new amendment might restrict the ability of states to discriminate against women. Contemporaneous comments from the primary author of the 14th Amendment himself Rep. John Bingham assured them that the new promise of equality would not interfere with state control over “domestic relations.” His comments reflected a broad consensus from the time reflected in the congressional record that the amendment would not establish equality or even a baseline of civil rights for women. (South Carolina cited this history to show that discrimination against both women and gay people remained constitutional by the way.) If the Supreme Court adopted this reading of the equal protection clause it would have to overturn every past ruling against sex discrimination making husbands the “head and master” of their households once again.

Progressive originalists generally respond to this obstacle by defining rights at a higher level of generality. The Constitutional Accountability Center for example argues that the equal protection clause forbids discrimination against women and gay people by outlawing “class-based” legislation. By denying rights to an entire group of people the theory goes the government condemns them to second-class status stamping them with an impermissible badge of legal inferiority.

It’s a fine idea—but is it really originalism? The answer probably depends on whether you want to salvage originalism or supplant it. If you want to salvage it then sure: It’s perfectly acceptable to define rights so broadly on such an abstract level that they can be squared with the “original meaning” of the Constitution. As George Washington University law professor Peter J. Smith has persuasively argued that is in fact precisely what today’s conservatives already do when mounting an originalist defense of Brown v. Board of Education. Evidence that the 14th Amendment’s Framers supported school segregation is overwhelming. So Brown’s defenders on the right define “equal protection” with sufficient abstraction to mandate integrated public education.

Should progressives want to salvage originalism though? Why step in to shore up a flailing theory that was born out of contempt for Black children women and criminal defendants? A theory that the Supreme Court is currently manipulating to impose conservative policy goals like nationwide public carry under the thin guise of judicial review?

Because originalist justices like Clarence Thomas are so incredibly bad at interpreting history cherry-picking facts and crediting debunked sources it may be tempting to conclude that they’re just doing it wrong. But why do it at all? The strong argument for progressive originalism is the hope that advocates can convince conservative judges to issue liberal decisions if they just present enough historical evidence. That hope feels increasingly hollow. When Thomas is presented with proof that his past views were rooted in bogus history he simply dismisses it. Activist scholars flood the nation’s law journals which are not peer-reviewed with tendentious or outright false historical claims which conservative justices then cite as the gospel truth. This is less like a legitimate judicial or academic enterprise than like a scam to reverse-engineer outcomes to fit a partisan agenda. Pointing out inaccuracies is not going to change the outcomes.

With originalism’s reputation so tarnished maybe progressives should stop co-opting the right’s brand altogether. Maybe they should embrace constitutional values like equality without squeezing them into a framework that was literally designed to shut out minorities from full citizenship. Maybe rather than trying to beat conservatives at their own game progressives should present a competing vision of constitutional interpretation to the public—one which acknowledges that original meaning is often unknowable and too frequently shackled to the antiquated views of dead white men. And maybe that would give disillusioned Americans a reason to believe in the rule of law once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L25pY29sZS1icm93bi1zaW1wc29uLWNvbmRvLWhhcHBlbmVkLTE0Mjk1NTgyOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nicole Brown Simpson's Condo: What Happened to the House Where She Was Murdered?,"Nicole Brown Simpson was married to O. J. Simpson for seven years. Reports suggest that the couple divorced in 1992 and two years later she and her friend Ron Goldman were brutally stabbed to death. O. J. Simpson was the main suspect in this double murder. Even though authorities arrested him and put him on trial the court controversially acquitted him.

Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman were murdered in her condo at 875 South Bundy Drive in Brentwood Los Angeles California. Since this tragedy this home has been scrutinized by many individuals. According to People Magazine its new owners completely transformed its shrubbery in 1997 rendering the murder site unrecognizable. Furthermore its address was changed in an attempt to cleanse its ugly reputation. It has also been sold multiple times.

Nicole Brown Simpson’s life and death will be the subject of an upcoming Lifetime docuseries titled The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson. Per IMDb its synopsis reads “Nicole Brown Simpson’s sisters and closest friends break their silence about her murder and O.J. Simpson’s controversial trial aiming to shed light on the truth.”

How many times was Nicole Brown Simpson’s condo sold?

Nicole Brown Simpson’s four-bedroom four-bath 3400 sq. ft townhouse was built in 1991. It first sold for $625000 in January 1994 five months before the murder. However two years after Nicole and Ron’s deaths the condo sold for a reduced price of $525000. According to People Magazine the condo was purchased again in 2006 but this time for a whopping $1.72 million. In total this infamous house has been sold three times.

In a 1997 conversation with the LA Times a resident of that area stated that Brentwood would forever be infamous for the double murders. He said “Brentwood is always going to have this ghost hanging over it — the place of the O.J. murders.”

O. J. Simpson died due to cancer on April 10 2024 at the age of 76.

ATLANTIC CITY — A week before it could walk out on strike against numerous Atlantic City casinos the resort’s main casino workers union warned that a strike could cost four casinos a total of $2.6 million a day in losses.

Local 54 of the Unite Here union issued a report Friday estimating that the city’s top-performing casino the Borgata could lose $1.6 million a day in the event of a strike and that the three casinos owned by Caesars Entertainment — Caesars Harrah’s and Tropicana — could collectively lose an additional $1 million a day.

The union made its projections based on past casino revenue and earnings data reported to the state and assumed that a strike would cause revenue to decline by 25% in the third quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2021.

Contracts with Atlantic City's nine casinos expired on June 1. The union has authorized a strike against these four casinos on July 1 if a new pact is not reached by then. (It also has set a July 3 strike deadline for Hard Rock whose finances were not included in Friday's projections.)

Bob McDevitt the union’s president had no immediate comment on the report Friday. Representatives of MGM Resorts International which owns the Borgata and Caesars Entertainment which owns the other three casinos did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.

Jane Bokunewicz director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University which studies the Atlantic City casino industry said it is difficult to accurately predict the financial impact of a strike with so many variables in play. These include the number of casinos that are targeted by a strike and the public’s willingness to patronize them in such an event.

“The casino floors at all properties would remain functioning as normal because they are not part of Local 54” she said. Casinos that are struck “would use nonunion employees and management to keep the hotel and food and beverage sites operating at an acceptable level to attract customers. Revenue losses or gains would depend on how successful they are at doing this.”

As of Friday the union had reached so-called “me-too” agreements with Bally's and the Ocean Casino Resort pledging them to adopt the terms of contracts eventually reached with the larger casinos in the city. That effectively means they will not be struck the union has said.

The union report said a strike could have a particularly meaningful impact on Caesars Entertainment which got 15% of its earnings from Atlantic City in the third quarter of last year.

In 2021 Caesars’ New Jersey properties generated 33.2% of their net revenue and 42% of their gross operating profit in the third quarter the union report said.

The union also noted that the timing of a strike could be painful for the casinos coming at the start of the July Fourth weekend traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for Atlantic City's casinos.

And it would come amid an ongoing labor shortage at all nine casinos. Local 54's workers clean hotel rooms and public areas including the casino floor and restrooms and staff food and beverage operations among other responsibilities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nhc2lub3MtZ2FtaW5nL2RldGFpbHMtZW1lcmdlLW9uLXBsYW5zLWZvci1zb3V0aC1zdHJpcC1yZXNvcnQtbmJhLXJlYWR5LWFyZW5hLTI1OTg1MTQv0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nhc2lub3MtZ2FtaW5nL2RldGFpbHMtZW1lcmdlLW9uLXBsYW5zLWZvci1zb3V0aC1zdHJpcC1yZXNvcnQtbmJhLXJlYWR5LWFyZW5hLTI1OTg1MTQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Details emerge on plans for south Strip resort NBA-ready arena,"Oak View Group’s planned 2000-room resort and 20000-seat NBA-ready arena on the south Strip are scheduled for a groundbreaking next year and an expected opening in 2026.

Details have emerged on Southern Nevada’s next big casino-resort project which will include a major sports and entertainment arena.

Last week Tim Leiweke and partner Irving Azoff of the Los Angeles-based Oak View Group named the executives that will drive development of the 2000-room OVG Las Vegas Hotel & Casino and its adjacent 20000-seat NBA-ready arena.

They’re Randy Morton former co-CEO of the Foley Entertainment Group and a four-decade hospitality executive with experience as president and chief operating officer of Bellagio and Marc Badain the longtime former president of the Raiders who helped relocate the team to Las Vegas from Oakland and guided construction of the $2 billion 65000-seat Allegiant Stadium.

The $3 billion project — $1 billion of which is dedicated to the arena — will be built on about 25 acres at Las Vegas Boulevard and Blue Diamond Road right next to Interstate 15 and 1½ miles south of Interstate 215.

Morton and Badain talked with the Review-Journal about the project which will break ground next year and is expected to be ready to open in 2026 (the interview has been edited for brevity and clarity):

Review-Journal: What was the biggest factor in your decision to sign on with this new project?

Randy Morton: My decision when I was approached by Tim Leiweke who shared the vision of the project was based on my being very excited to have the opportunity to get back into the casino-hotel world after 19½ years at Bellagio. Re-entering the market on the casino and hotel side was very exciting and very challenging and I really look forward to working with the Oak View Group Tim and the team and working side by side with Marc Badain.

Marc Badain: I’d add very similar thoughts. Obviously I’ve known Tim a very long time. He’s pretty much a legend in the sports world when you look at what he’s done the last five or six years building Oak View Group into the powerhouse that it is. When he approached me probably around the new year and explained his vision of what he wanted to do here for a live music venue and an arena and integrating the resort into it it was pretty hard to say no. He’s a hard guy to say no to anyway but then when he presented this concept and what he was looking to accomplish here especially on the heels of the three or four successful projects that he and the team at Oak View Group have completed in the last 24 months it was pretty easy to say yes.

What are some of the details you can share about this resort and arena project?

Badain: I’ll start on the arena side. We’re looking to build the greatest arena on Earth and Las Vegas needs it and Las Vegas deserves it. If you look at the trajectory of music venues and sports venues in Las Vegas of this size it’s about every 10 years for a new one. You could go back over time and see that evolution of facilities. By the time we open our venue it will be about 10 years since they opened T-Mobile (Arena) and it’s time to have a new venue in Las Vegas that’s worthy of Las Vegas. The market has shown its ability to absorb new venues and has enough capacity and enough programming to do it. It’s time to put the investment behind it and the folks at Oak View Group are the best in the world at doing it and have just completed a number of venues and bring all of that expertise and all the best practices from those venues and apply them to Las Vegas.

Morton: We’re at the early stages and and obviously this is day 2 for me so it’s very exciting with the early stages with master-planning and design and development of a luxury boutique casino-resort. The integration of the arena and the connectivity to the site is very exciting. And I love the location. It’s easy in easy out with multiple ways in off I-15 and of course I-215 which is very exciting and very appealing to all customers. I’m starting the process with Gensler (one of the design architects) and with Marc and we’re very excited to be working on the master-planning and get going on the layout of the flow of the project. It’s easy in and out off Las Vegas Boulevard South into this amazing casino-resort and arena.

2000-room resort

How many rooms will you have?

Morton: We’re working on 2000 rooms including all rooms and suites. That’s really what we’re calling a luxury boutique casino-resort.

How about the arena size?

Badain: 20000 (seats) is the target to start with and we’ll take a look at some design options and what’s the best capacity for the demand incorporating that into what Randy is talking about with the resort. We want to make sure the size of the arena makes sense for the property and for the live music world going forward and what they really want out of that experience. Is it better to have a little smaller venue than 20000 or should we go larger? We’ll take a look at all the options and put together an optimal plan.

Randy you’ve worked for MGM Resorts International. Do you have any reservations about going up against the big players in Las Vegas including Caesars Entertainment Wynn Resorts Ltd. and your former employer?

Morton: I’m excited about the opportunity to get back into the luxury hotel-casino business. Before Bellagio I was with Four Seasons Hotels for 19 years all over the continental U.S. at many luxury properties. For me I’m very excited about the opportunity to come back to the casino-hotel business after a great year working as co-CEO for the Foley Entertainment Group working for Bill Foley. This is an incredible opportunity for me to get back into the luxury business. It’s very competitive and I’m very competitive Marc’s very competitive and Tim Leiweke’s very competitive so we’re excited to start working on this project and really build something special.

NBA-ready

Marc will you be able to leverage some of your professional sports experience toward attracting a major sports tenant to the arena?

Badain: What we’ve said publicly is what I’ll say to you: We’ll build an NBA-ready venue but it’s not our decision. Decisions are made at the league level. There are 30 owners and they’ll decide where they want to expand if they want to expand. I know there’s been a lot of chatter in the media but we’re going to stay out of that chatter and we’re going to be very respectful of the process and when the ownership group in the NBA and the commissioner of the NBA decide they want to expand we’ll have a venue that’s ready for them and if they want to be in the Las Vegas market we’ll be an option for them.

So are there any updates on the prospect of attracting an NBA team?

Badain: I don’t have anything to share at this time that we haven’t already said. That’s their process. They’ve said some things probably in terms of timing and it’s our job just to build an NBA-ready venue and be ready for that discussion when they’re ready to have it.

Soccer stadium?

Are there any updates on whether a Major League Soccer stadium could be built on land adjacent to your project?

Badain: That’s not our land but we’ve had some discussions with representatives of Wes Edens’ group. They’re working on the Brightline rail station for that piece of property as well. There’s three main property owners. There’s the piece of property that we bought the property that Wes owns and there’s a property to the north and all three property owners have stayed in communication over the last couple of months just to make sure we coordinate things from infrastructure standpoints (Clark) County approval standpoints and to make sure all our projects are going to complement each other. There is communication but in terms of where they are on the soccer stadium but I don’t want to speculate or speak for them. You’d have to ask them where they are. But we’ve heard the same things you have which is they have the rights to the expansion franchise and that’s the location they’ve looked at for a potential stadium.

People don’t realize just how much land is there and what can be done with it.

Badain: You really have about a 270-acre parcel when you take a look at that piece of land. I think you remember that was one of the locations that was mentioned for the (Allegiant) Stadium site five or six years ago. The rail station gives you a chance to really add to the density of the entire parcel. So if you have our project on 25 acres and then there’s 41 additional acres that’s part of our parcel that will be developed and then there’s about a 110-acre parcel for the high-speed rail station and a soccer stadium and then another 60-plus-acre parcel north of that. So you’re really talking about a massive amount of development that’s going to occur there over the next five to 10 years. When you talk about the high-speed-rail station I know they have some very exciting plans for what they may build around it in terms of potential mixed use whether it’s commercial space residential space hotel space stadium space. You have a lot of options there and it’s one of the last major pieces of undeveloped land on Las Vegas Boulevard.

Transportation connections

What are some of the advantages to locating next door to the planned high-speed-rail train station connecting to Southern California?

Morton: The transportation is very important obviously with the incredible Harry Reid International Airport nearby the drive-in traffic the changes and growing demand for Lyft and Uber and of course the Brightline train potentially coming into the site certainly would be very exciting and very welcomed certainly for all of our customers that would come from Southern California. What a great option for transportation to come for a two- three- or four-day visit to Las Vegas arriving on the Brightline train. It sounds like a really brilliant business plan.

With what’s planned it seems like you’ll capture different audiences for sports concerts shows and conventions.

Badain: I think that’s spot on. You’re going to have a live music entertainment venue for concerts and other events like you spoke of. Because it’s integrated into a resort property you can incorporate any of the large-scale events going on at the hotel and you can utilize the arena as a venue and support for what’s going on inside the resort.

It sounds like plenty of cross-marketing opportunities.

Badain: Absolutely. When you talk about what the consumers are looking for they can check into their room and never leave the property and utilize all the services that the resort that Randy’s going to put together can offer. You can walk directly into an arena and see a concert without ever having to leave the comfort of the destination.

This property is farther south than most of what’s on Las Vegas Boulevard. Do you see the resort corridor shifting south?

Morton: I love the location in south Las Vegas from the access standpoint and from the connection to I-15 and I-215. The ease of getting in and out of this property will certainly benefit the casino business seven days a week. The trending luxury business is really going to drive weekends and we’re going to be very focused on the MICE (meetings incentives conventions and expositions) business on weekdays which will be very successful. The location fits perfectly for the connectivity to the arena the access to the hotel-casino to the arena.

Will there be convention facilities or will the arena fit that need?

Morton: The arena will be available for convention business and corporate business but also there will be convention space in the hotel-casino property.

So ballrooms meeting rooms things like that?

Morton: Correct.

Oversaturation of arenas?

There has been some not-so-subtle commentary about Las Vegas being oversaturated with arenas. Your thoughts?

Badain: I don’t think Randy and I would sign on and I don’t think Tim and Oak View Group would make the investment if we thought Las Vegas was oversaturated. Again I’ll point back to the history and the evolutions of arenas and the use of the arenas in Las Vegas going back to the Thomas & Mack Center to the Orleans Arena to the Michelob Ultra Arena the (MGM) Grand Garden Arena the T-Mobile to the (Madison Square Garden) Sphere and to our project. Vegas has shown an ability to absorb those venues. The live entertainment business is not going anywhere. It’s really the most lucrative part of the entertainment business live performances. The need for those spaces is not going away. I don’t have any doubts in my mind about the ability for Las Vegas to support another venue.

And Oak View with all its arenas nationwide is very connected to the entertainment scene right?

Badain: Absolutely.

Former Las Vegas Raiders employees alleged the NFL team enabled a culture in Oakland and Las Vegas where workers felt unsupported underpaid and penalized.

For many Las Vegas Raiders employees working for the NFL organization means living out their dreams.

The prestige comes with many perks. Some workers travel attend games and meet star athletes all while on the job.

But there’s a constant reminder that you are dispensable numerous former employees discovered.

They told the Review-Journal the storied franchise enabled a culture in Oakland and Las Vegas that left them feeling unsupported underpaid and at risk of retaliation if they voiced concerns. Those complaints were echoed in multiple lawsuits filed over the course of a decade.

Women who used to work for the team also alleged a troubling pattern of harassment forced demotions and unequal treatment with one calling it a “boys club and the mob wrapped in one.”

“When you’re in that environment it’s kind of like survival of the fittest” said Nicolle Reeder who filed a class-action lawsuit against the team in 2020 for violating California labor law.

The revelations come amid growing scrutiny of NFL workplace complaints with a congressional oversight committee on June 22 announcing plans to subpoena the Washington Commanders owner over harassment allegations made by female employees.

The high-profile exits of at least 10 Raiders leaders in the past year including longtime president Marc Badain and head coach Jon Gruden underscore the organization’s ongoing internal turmoil.

Even ex-interim President Dan Ventrelle who was fired in early May claimed he was terminated for trying to act as a whistleblower. Ventrelle told the Review-Journal on May 6 that he was retaliated against after alerting the NFL about concerns of a hostile work environment.

But Nicole Adams a former Raiders human resources employee said Ventrelle was well aware of how employees were treated.

“Dan was involved in every situation that happened every situation of harassment every situation of a hostile working condition” she said.

Ventrelle declined to comment for this story.

Raiders owner Mark Davis who also owns the WNBA’s Las Vegas Aces provided a single comment on June 21: “Eventually I will have something to say about all of this but not right now.”

‘You’re supposed to protect people’

The week after Ventrelle’s firing the Raiders unexpectedly gave employees significant raises and bonuses according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.

Several workers have described actions by front office leaders that would contradict anti-harassment and retaliation policies laid out in the team’s employee handbook which was obtained by the Review-Journal.

At The Raider Image team retail store one worker said he was denied overtime pay and was watched on surveillance video during his shift to monitor his productivity. In one instance he said he was criticized for blowing his nose.

The team’s human resources leadership turned over three times in the past two years. Ex-employees also have raised concerns about how seriously complaints were handled and whether effective actions were taken.

Adams who worked in HR for nearly five years said she was directed to create job descriptions that allowed the company to skirt paying overtime for workers.

Some women claimed they were told how to dress and were singled out for distracting the men in the office. Adams who lives in Las Vegas said she repeatedly was made uncomfortable over what she wore to work even if it was a turtleneck dress down to her knees.

“Those things were inappropriate because I had boobs and a butt” she said. “I just started wearing pants because I felt like I couldn’t wear skirts or dresses or I would be seen as being provocative.”

Adams also described being kissed by a former Oakland Raiders employee who worked for football operations. He was allowed to continue working there despite executives knowing about his inappropriate behavior she said.

Ventrelle then general counsel “jokingly said that he would be ready to pay off anybody who came with a formal complaint against that person” according to Adams.

Adams was fired in November 2020 after she reported feeling targeted by her supervisors in human resources. She did not accept a severance payment that would have required her to stay quiet.

She said she was so affected by her experience that she filed a complaint against the Raiders with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission a partner of the Nevada Equal Rights Commission.

Adams who is Black accuses the team in her complaint of discriminating against her because of her race and retaliating against her after she reported concerns about pay disparity and unequal treatment.

“Every time someone was let go every time someone was retaliated against or pushed out every time they had to leave feeling less than themselves it hurt me” Adams said. “In the role of an HR professional you’re supposed to protect people from things like that but I had no power to do so.”

[ Lawsuits claims against the Raiders since 2013 ]

Trouble before move to Las Vegas

Culture issues at the Raiders are not a surprise said a former employee with knowledge of how Davis runs his organizations.

“To Mark’s credit he does a good job of taking care of the players and providing them resources” said the source who was granted anonymity by the Review-Journal to prevent potential retribution. “But part of that makes you feel like it’s a facade. If you’re a truly good leader and organization builder then you treat everybody well. Not just a certain faction.”

Before the Raiders relocated from California to Southern Nevada in 2020 three Black women in the franchise’s human resources department were offered demoted titles. A fourth woman of Hispanic descent was terminated. The turnover came during a time when employees depended on HR for benefits and advice amid company changes and a move to another state.

Only Adams made the move to Las Vegas. The department’s leader Karla Tai who did not respond to requests for comment stayed on to help with the transition but left in December 2020. She had worked for the company for 18 years.

Jaime Stratton an experienced Las Vegas human resources manager became head of the department in March 2020 but was fired in April 2022. Stratton had worked at Caesars Entertainment Corp. and brought in several employees from the hospitality industry some of whom are still with the Raiders.

In an emailed statement to the Review-Journal Stratton said she was saddened to hear about Adams’ claims.

“The Raiders organization hired me into a newly created position in March of 2020 to ensure compliance with and modernization of its human resources and culture practices challenges which continue to exist today” she wrote. “I handled matters within my control properly and with unwavering integrity.”

Executive turnover

The past year has been a tumultuous one for the Raiders’ front office.

Last July Badain who declined to comment for this story resigned from his position as president. He was followed by vice president of strategy and business development Brandon Doll chief financial officer Ed Villanueva controller Araxie Grant and chief revenue officer Mark Shearer.

Davis publicly credited some of those exits to accounting irregularities.

But the turnover continued.

In October coach Gruden resigned after alleged racist misogynistic and anti-gay emails written by him uncovered during the Washington team investigation were leaked to the national media. In January general manager Mike Mayock was fired.

Newly hired Chief Operations and Analytics Officer Jeremy Aguero resigned in May and Ventrelle was fired later that week. Aguero who had joined the Raiders in October after a 24-year stint with Applied Analysis has given little explanation for his departure and declined to comment for this story.

In a statement to the Review-Journal last month Aguero said he had informed Davis why he was resigning and that he looked forward to taking some time off to determine his future.

Ventrelle who spent 18 years with the Raiders told the Review-Journal when he left that he was fired after reporting to the NFL that multiple employees had written complaints alleging misconduct.

“(Davis) did not demonstrate the warranted level of concern” Ventrelle said.

But Ventrelle’s comments didn’t make sense to Adams who said she came to him on more than one occasion and was eventually pushed out in late 2020 two weeks after bringing more concerns to his attention.

“He always said that he was going to help us but instead we were all replaced” she said.

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league would not comment on allegations against the Raiders. He previously said the matter would be examined.

A $3.4 billion team

The family-owned Raiders came to Las Vegas with a chance to start fresh — and grow in value.

The franchise which played its first season in 1960 in the American Football League couldn’t get a new stadium built to replace the aging Oakland Coliseum. Upon arriving in Las Vegas in 2020 the Raiders left behind the worst field in the NFL and moved into one of its best venues the $2 billion Allegiant Stadium.

The value of the Raiders franchise took off as Davis explored relocation to Southern Nevada which was approved by his fellow franchise owners in 2017. It has increased 117 percent — to $3.4 billion — in the past five years and was ranked last year as the 29th most valuable sports franchise in the world by Forbes.

The potential sale of the Denver Broncos for $4.65 billion could raise the Raiders’ value to $3.8 billion.

Despite the absence of a president and the shakeup in the Raiders’ front office operations at Allegiant Stadium are not expected to be affected according to Steve Hill president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Hill helped create the framework that led to $750 million in public financing for the stadium which ultimately lured the Raiders to Nevada. Allegiant Stadium has since become a major tourism driver and will host the 2024 Super Bowl.

“Obviously turmoil is not helpful and I encourage a strong look at all of that for a quick and positive resolution” Hill said of the football team. “That’s what the community needs it’s what the stadium needs and I think it’s what the Raiders organization needs.”

‘Good company in the NFL’

Over the years the Raiders have been accused of underpaying employees and treating them unfairly.

In 2014 Lacy Fields became the first Raiderette cheerleader to demand more.

When she joined the then-Oakland team she learned the strict rules upfront.

Never discuss wages or fraternize with the players she was told. And if she gained more than 4 pounds she risked being benched for an entire game without pay.

Each cheerleader was paid a flat fee of $125 per game — regardless of how many hours they worked. The women did not receive their checks until the end of the season. They also weren’t paid for their mandatory thrice-weekly practices but if they were late or brought the wrong equipment they faced fines ranging from $10 to $125 according to court documents.

Fields and her teammates spent nine months making public appearances attending photo shoots minicamps and home games and only earned about $1250. The team mascots and stadium concession workers earned more.

The 40 women were also on the hook for all mandatory hair nail and makeup appointments at Raiderette-approved salons which amounted to hundreds of dollars in costs.

“They wanted to use us but at the end of the day they did not care about our well-being” Fields said. “That’s what it felt like and that’s how they paid us.”

Something about the team’s contract felt wrong from the get-go Fields said. She had always been paid fairly and promptly when she danced for the NBA’s Golden State Warriors. When she brought up the inequity to her peers on the squad they told her to keep quiet or risk losing her coveted spot.

She filed a class-action lawsuit at the end of the 2013 season alleging theft and unfair employment practices. The team quickly settled and agreed to pay $1.25 million to the women who worked during the 2010 to 2013 seasons and cover their out-of-pocket expenses.

Current cheerleaders now earn at least minimum wage meager money when it comes to the lifetime of athletic training and value the Raiderettes bring to the franchise and game-day experience.

Fields’ lawsuit also spurred a movement: Other NFL cheerleaders sued including teams in Buffalo Tampa Bay and New York.

But one thing Fields said she wished the lawsuit had done was spark an apology.

“They just kind of swept it under the rug snuck in some changes and moved on like normal” Fields said. “If they were handing us illegal contracts for 40 years who knows what else is going on in that office?”

California attorney Sharon Vinick whose firm represented Fields and cheerleaders for the New York Jets said there’s still a long way to go for women in sports.

She pointed to the Dallas Cowboys who settled a lawsuit in 2019 after four cheerleading squad members accused a team executive of voyeurism in their locker room.

Last year the Washington Commanders were fined $10 million after dozens of female employees accused the owner Daniel Snyder and other top executives of harassment.

A congressional memo released Wednesday found that Snyder directed a “shadow investigation” while being investigated by the NFL for misconduct in an attempt to interfere with and undermine its findings. Commissioner Roger Goodell told the oversight committee that he does not recall the league being informed in 2009 of the allegations of sexual harassment and assault.

“The Raiders have had problems but they’ve got some good company in the NFL” Vinick said. “Things are not going to change until these women who are being subjected to this discriminatory treatment stand up and do something.”

History of complaints

Since 2013 at least 10 lawsuits have been filed against the Raiders by former employees alleging wrongdoing and discrimination.

Former football scout Bradley Kaplan filed a lawsuit in 2019 alleging that he was demoted after telling the team he and his wife were expecting a baby during the football season.

His new position required traveling and when he requested family leave to care for his newborn and wife Kaplan was fired his complaint states.

Kaplan also claimed in his lawsuit that the Raiders required some football operations personnel to sign unlawful confidentiality and nondisparagement agreements preventing employees from “blowing the whistle” on wrongdoing by the Raiders.

The Raiders denied those claims but ultimately agreed to a $25000 settlement last year with past and current employees who signed contracts with those provisions.

In April Las Vegan Matthew Proscia filed a class-action lawsuit alleging the team’s apparel retail store failed to pay him and other employees at The Raider Image overtime wages for working more than eight hours in a workday a violation of Nevada law.

Proscia who has multiple sclerosis said he took the job as an opportunity to showcase some of his Raiders designs.

“It’s surreal no matter what your wage is to pull up to an NFL stadium and to walk on the ground of something that has the pulse of America” he said.

But he and other employees were not allowed to leave their work areas on game day. Bathroom trips were allowed only during employees’ 15-minute breaks. If the employees weren’t actively working during their entire shift their hours would be cut he recalled.

“I feel it’s an abuse of power; I’m a human being” he said.

When Proscia approached human resources with his concerns he said he was told not to come to work the next day which he could not afford to do.

“I don’t necessarily want a paycheck” he said. “I want justice for what’s going on.”

Last year the Raiders settled a lawsuit filed by Reeder who worked as a game-day employee and lobby receptionist. Her 2020 complaint alleged that the Raiders had violated labor laws by failing to provide adequate pay and denying workers required rest periods and meal breaks.

The team settled for $325000 which was distributed among more than 400 employees.

Reeder described the workplace as one where she felt scared to speak up and women were not taken seriously. She often worked for the team for more than 20 hours a week during the season on top of her full-time job.

“They knew we would say yes to anything they asked us to do because it’s my favorite football team” Reeder said.

‘Fighting for my place’

Adams saw herself working the rest of her career in the sports industry.

She was able to bring her family to games travel for recruiting and realize her career goals.

But the pressure increased after she moved to Las Vegas with the company. Complaints made to HR were not investigated properly according to Adams. The companywide trust of the department dwindled leading to fewer people speaking up she added.

Things took a turn in August 2020 when Adams asked her supervisor why a male attorney was being offered a salary about $50000 higher than his female counterpart.

She said she then felt targeted because she was the only person in HR being asked to justify her overtime. She was also the only one to have her relocation package questioned despite employees in other departments receiving the same benefit.

“I was the only person they investigated and I just happened to be the Black person they investigated” she said.

Adams said she called Ventrelle who was then the Raiders’ general counsel and in charge of the human resources department to seek advice. While recounting how she was being treated she claimed he interrupted and berated her for questioning the pay difference between two lawyers.

Ventrelle said he was offended that she would question his integrity she recalled.

“I felt intimidated” Adams said. “I felt like he was the person who had allowed them to treat me this way at that moment.”

In the months that followed Adams said she was repeatedly disciplined for performing job functions that she had been doing for years or had been directed to do by her superiors.

In November 2020 she reached out to Ventrelle one last time to file a formal complaint in hopes that there would be an investigation. She was terminated two weeks later.

“Until the very very end I was still fighting for my position” she said. “I was still fighting for my place there.”

The occasion was a “special launch ceremony” with the atmosphere of a high-end intergalactic nightclub: futuristic blue lights trumpet-heavy music a sci-fi jumbotron that read BOUNDLESS.

“This is another extraordinary day in the storied history of Gulfstream” the company’s president Larry Flynn told the crowd. They were unveiling a “new family” of luxury aircraft: the Gulfstream GVII G500 and G600s capable of going 5984 miles and 7595 miles respectively without refueling.

The planes had been in development for six years under what the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association described as “strict military-like secrecy.”

Designed from scratch the new models could carry up to 19 passengers and had three to four “living areas” 8 to 10 places to sleep two state-of-the art bathrooms stone floors and countertops leather upholstery a luxury entertainment system and 14 of Gulfstream’s trademark oval windows—the biggest in the air—so large one reviewer compared them to “seeing a movie in IMAX after a lifetime of squinting at iPad screens.”

The jets wouldn’t be available for several years. But once they hit the market Gulfstream’s executives promised the models would offer “an optimal combination of speed range wide-cabin comfort and fuel burn.”

A G500 costs upward of $50 million.

Those perks came with a hefty price tag. The first G500 sold in September of 2018 for $45.5 million. The G600 slightly larger and able to travel 1300 nautical miles farther went out the following August for $57.9 million. Even so there was a near-immediate order backlog.

In 2014 Flexjet a private plane leasing and fractional ownership company reportedly purchased 50 Gulfstream planes including six G500s. In 2019 Qatar Executive the private jet offshoot of Qatar Airways added five G500s to their fleet.

Approximately 180 of the new Gulfstreams in the U.S. and abroad are now registered to some of the richest people alive. Those .1-percenters have mostly shielded their purchases behind shell companies and anonymous-sounding L.L.C.’s but several can be tied to some of America’s most voracious wealth hoarders such as the Campbell Soup heir Bennett Dorrance; New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft; car dealer Herb Chambers; natural-gas exporter Michael S. Smith; heiress Gigi Pritzker; and big-budget-movie director Michael Bay.

But those billionaires have had some trouble getting back down to earth. According to a source familiar with Gulfstream aircraft the G500s and G600s have a glitch in their computer software that can send these planes into a nosedive if their pilots try to land in winds stronger than 15 knots.

The new models have 14 oval windows so large one reviewer compared them to “seeing a movie in IMAX after a lifetime of squinting at iPad screens.”

That’s about 17.3 miles per hour or the aviation equivalent of a gusty breeze. A private-jet consultant who represents several Gulfstream owners estimates the flaw could impact 75 percent of his clients’ trips. “So [let’s say] for example you’ve just got this $55 million plane” he tells me “and you’re supposed to go on vacation to the South of France. But the wind is forecast to be in excess of 15 knots upon landing. Guess what? You can’t go.”

All the owners—whom the consultant who requested not to be named for this story called “the Who’s Who of the world”—are in “a freaking uproar.” Lawyers have started talking about class-action lawsuits. According to one source some prospective owners have canceled orders until the problem gets solved.

“In 50 years of flying I’ve never had anything like this” says Dorrance. The glitch has not radically disrupted his plans beyond having to move up his takeoff time to avoid wind. But “as G500 owners—supposedly the most luxurious make of aircraft in the world—we shouldn’t have those problems” Dorrance said. “I mean it’s totally unfair.”

A pilot’s view of the Gulfstream G500 cockpit.

Another owner who requested anonymity explained that he’s outraged not only because his private jet is unusable but also because of the recurring fees and costs that have racked up while the plane has been grounded. “You pay $40-plus million for your aircraft. You employ pilots you employ a mechanic. You have to pay for a hangar and all the other ancillary costs which are fixed expenses” he explained.

The owner estimates that the plane costs him $300000 a month. “It’s a terrible situation. I’ve talked to the president of Gulfstream [to say] ‘basically you’ve rendered these planes unreliable.’”

It’s unclear when the glitches started or when Gulfstream first became aware of the problem. The first public clue was a nighttime flight on February 6 2020 when it was reported that a G500 model sped into a “hard landing”—pilot jargon for a high-speed heavy touchdown just short of a crash.

“As G500 owners—supposedly the most luxurious make of aircraft in the world—we shouldn’t have those problems.”

According to the F.A.A. the pilot lost control of the plane’s angle sending it nose-first into an “unexpected high rate of descent” of about 900 feet per minute. (Federal flying guidelines recommend a target descent rate of 500 calling anything more than 1000 “unacceptable.”) In this case the passengers were only a few feet off the ground but the landing was hard enough that it damaged the nearly-24-ton plane. (Gulfstream has not publicly disclosed the extent of the damage.)

It wasn’t a freak accident. The F.A.A. investigated the incident and determined that there was an “unsafe condition” in the plane’s engineering. An aviation expert summarized the glitch as the plane’s “software battling with the pilot” for control.

The mishaps are reminiscent of the Boeing 737 Max crashes when faulty software caused two planes to nosedive. According to Bob Chrampanis a pilot employed by a G500 owner the two glitches are technically unrelated engineering issues. “The only similarity is it’s a situation where the software program gets to a point where the computer takes control of the airplane” he explained.

After the G500 incident the F.A.A. issued a regulation called an “airworthiness directive” barring pilots from among other things landing in winds of more than 22 knots. At first that rule was only temporary. Regulators said Gulfstream was working on a fix and they’d revisit the ban once it was approved. Two years later a version of it is still in place.

In early April of this year another G500 plane hurtled into a hard landing. The circumstances were nearly identical—the computer overrode the pilot and the plane pitched forward entered a fast descent and hit the ground so hard it damaged the aircraft’s body.

Gulfstream notified owners with a letter later that month; two weeks after that the F.A.A. issued a much longer directive lowering the wind limit again.

At least owners will experience hard landings on soft leather.

“They waited until two terrible accidents happened … and then they decided to do something” Dorrance says. “As soon as they had that problem after the first accident they should have been working hard on software things.”

(A spokesperson for Gulfstream says the company has “proactively communicated with all G500 and G600 owners and remains available for any needed support.”)

As of now the consultant says the planes “literally can’t land” in anything other than optimal conditions. “You spent all of this money and you’re stuck with it” he says.

A spokesperson for the company said Gulfstream “has been working closely with the F.A.A. on a software update” which “has been completed and we anticipate F.A.A. approval and subsequent deployment later this year.” But that will likely be long after the vacations many of Gulfstream’s owners have likely planned.

The consultant said that several G500 and G600 owners are furious in part due to the technical issues but also because of Gulfstream’s response. Owners expected a degree of obsequiousness that Gulfstream lacked. The company was “like Oh we’ll get this fixed but it’s not going to be for a couple of months—relax” the consultant explains. But “these people don’t relax.” In the meantime some owners started chartering jets. Gulfstream doesn’t cover the expense.

“[Gulfstream is] owned by [the aerospace-and-defense company] General Dynamics who make lovely things that kill people for defense contractors” says the consultant. “They’re not used to a bunch of screaming billionaires.”

Camilla Belle is one of those stars.

The growth of pop culture in the past two decades has led to a rise in stylists and the need for them. Many celebrities rely on these fashion aficionados to come up with showstopping red carpet looks. In turn this gives the stylists a platform to showcase their work. However a select group of celebrities prefers to go with their gut when choosing red carpet looks. Camilla Belle is one of those stars as she takes style advice from her mom and herself.

Camilla Belle started her entertainment career in commercials

Belle was born in 1986 to country music performers Jack Wesley Routh and Cristina Gould. During the onset of Belle’s career she appeared in several TV commercials for well-known brands such as Campbell’s Soup Cabbage Patch Kids and Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals.

She landed her first lead role in Trapped Beneath The Earth in 1992. She later landed minor roles in A Little Princess The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Adventures In Odyssey. Her performance in the 1998 Sandra Bullock film Practical Magic landed her a Youth In Film Young Artist Award nod.

That same year she appeared in The Patriot and Walker: Texas Ranger. In 2000 she joined the Disney Channel TV film Rip Girls in the lead role. After appearing in Back To The Secret Garden Belle took a break from acting returning with The Quiet in 2005.

In 2006 the actor became the face of Vera Wang’s Princess fragrance doing print ads and TV commercials for the company. She completed her contract in 2009. Belle continued her acting career in 2006 by appearing in When a Stranger Calls 10000 BC in 2008 Mad Whale in 2017 and 10 Truths About Love in 2022.

Camilla Belle takes styling advice from herself and her mom

Belle has a stunning face and has graced several publications due to her style. Her red-carpet looks also don’t disappoint. It’s therefore surprising to learn that she doesn’t have a stylist. According to CDN Scooper News the actor doesn’t see the need for a stylist as she has her mother and grandmother for that.

The publication details that Belle’s mother has been a helpful resource for style inspiration for the actor for a long time. The site quotes her saying “I have to give a lot of credit to my mom. She has been my stylist and clothes extraordinaire my entire life so we kind of work on everything together.”

Belle noted that she and her mother take inspiration from Elizabeth Taylor and the old Hollywood glamour on several occasions. The 35-year-old also swears by a tip passed down to her by her grandmother. She said “My grandma was a really stunning woman and even when she was almost 80 years old she would never leave the house without putting on her lipstick.”

Like her nana Belle never leaves the house without a bit of makeup sharing that mascara is her favorite item. Belle also noted that her mother helped her take care of her skin saying that her mom was tough on her about applying sunscreen before leaving the house but now she does it.

Celebrities who don’t use stylists

Belle isn’t the only star who has no use for a stylist. Mad Men actor January Jones told Donatella Versace in an interview with Elle in 2009 that she doesn’t fancy the idea of paying people to tell her that what she is wearing looks good. She said “If I don’t feel it myself why would I wear it.”

On the other hand Gossip Girl‘s Blake Lively feels her control issues and ego are the major reasons she can never employ a stylist. The actor works close with designers to come up with her iconic looks.

Others on the list include Kate Moss Diane Kruger and Emmy Rossum.",,,,,,,,,

Having your card cancelled for you? Where should you put your points? We get this question pretty often when people have a need to park the rest of their points for one reason or another. On this week’s Frequent Miler on the Air Greg and I discuss the best programs with which to park your points (and the worst ones) and mull over the pros and cons of each eventually picking favorites. While we would of course first recommend finding a way to preserve flexibility through a product change combining with a partner or opening the right no-annual-fee card this episode was for those times when there isn’t a better option.

This week at Frequent Miler

With Brex recently closing the accounts of all small business owners a number of people have asked us what to do with their Brex points. The same type of question gets posed pretty frequently about cards from other issuers as well — whether you close your account someone else (i.e. the bank) closes it or other circumstances necessitate closing it you may find yourself in a situation to need to transfer points somewhere. Where to park your points is somewhat subjective although some programs are clearly better options (and others worse). This post shares some of my thoughts on the best options though this week’s podcast features a continuation of the discussion.

Drafting the Dream: The latest 3Cards3Continents posts

This week saw draft day determine the stable of cards that Greg Stephen and I each have to work with in order to plan an epic trip to (at least) 3 different continents. The rules prevented any two people from getting the same card and the budget prevented any one of us from getting two ultra-premium cards but I’d say that we each put together a powerhouse wallet nonetheless. Many people were surprised to see two American Airlines cards and so few Chase cards go in the draft. Would you have picked something we didn’t?

I loved reading about Greg’s 40K to Far Away trip. For our 2019 challenge we were each on a whirlwind trip on a shoestring budget. Because we were all traveling at the same time and constantly on the go between countries and time zones it was nearly impossible for each of us to keep up with what the others were doing. I had caught bits and pieces of Greg’s story but I had completely forgotten even the details I knew (like when the roof blew off of his bus! and how *that* was the better outcome than the alternative that day!). We essentially did that challenge on what amounted to a *single* credit card bonus (or even less than some of the best bonuses these days). If Greg could put together something this incredible with 40K points and $400 I can’t wait to see what he comes up with this time around.

Speaking of putting together something incredible with a single credit card imagine what you could do with 180K or 260K Membership rewards points. Now imagine getting those points from a single credit card. I’m including this quick deal post in our week in review because the potential windfall here is too big to miss. These offers are worth a phone call to find out if you are targeted provided that you can meet the spending requirements.

This short post is just to highlight good news for the many Capital One Venture and Venture X cardholders out there: while Priority Pass has lost Plaza Premium lounges Capital One has picked them up. Venture cardholders can use one or both of their 2 annual free lounge passes and Venture X cardholders get unlimited visits. Plaza Premium lounges tend to be a cut above most non-flagship airline lounges (in other words they won’t compete with Qatar’s business and first class flagship lounges in Doha but on average they are far nicer than an ordinary Priority Pass lounge). If you’ll be passing through an airport with a Plaza Premium lounge (like say on that #3Cards3Continents trip :-) this could be great news.

Tim recently visited the Hyatt Regency Vancouver. While there aren’t many Hyatt Regency hotels that are destinations unto themselves ( Park Hyatt Hyatt Regency Hakone aside) this one seems like a terrific value. I’ve only ever been through the Vancouver airport but if I get a chance to plan a trip there one day I’d be happy to spend not-so-many points to stay here.

That’s it for this week at Frequent Miler. Keep your eye on this week’s month-ending last chance deals as a number of deals will end on Thursday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9kZWFscy9jb3N0YS1yaWNhLWZhbGwtZGVhbC1hbGVydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deal alert: Travel to Costa Rica this fall for as low as $218 round trip,"Starting this fall you can trade autumn leaves for palm trees with this flight deal to Costa Rica.

Here’s a positive development that will make the process of accessing Priority Pass lounges even easier.

You no longer need a Priority Pass card

Priority Pass is the world’s largest network of airport lounges with over 1300 locations around the world. There are several premium credit cards that offer memberships as a perk with registration being required for activation. Even though credit cards offer this as a perk historically your credit card as such hasn’t gotten you access to Priority Pass lounges.

That’s to say that you needed to register for a Priority Pass membership and then show your Priority Pass membership card (or the digital version in the Priority Pass app) to access a lounge. That’s no longer needed at least for one card. Per an email from Priority Pass:

You can now enter locations in the world’s leading airport lounge program Priority Pass with your payment card! How to activate your payment card as a means of access Log in to your online account at prioritypass.com and the payment card associated with your Priority Pass account will automatically be activated for you to use to enter lounges. Activation of your payment card to access airport lounges and experiences is not currently available in the Priority Pass app. Please allow 12 hours for the activation to take effect. Some locations are unable to accept payment cards for entry see the full list here and remember to have your Digital Membership Card or alternative means of access available.

In other words you’ll now be able to access Priority Pass lounges by presenting your premium credit card at the entrance. The catch is that I’m told that for the time being this is only possible with the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card (review) (Rates & Fees) and not with other cards.

I’m curious if Capital One is paying extra for this (so that people keep the card in their wallet) or why this is just limited to that card for now. Hopefully other cards get a similar option in the future.

Eventyr Lounge Copenhagen Airport (CPH)

Is this a significant development?

This seems like a positive common sense development though it’s also important to understand what this does and doesn’t mean.

You still need to register your premium credit card to be able to use it at Priority Pass lounges so this doesn’t suddenly mean that you can use your credit card at a Priority Pass lounge without actually having registered it.

There are a few things I see as the primary benefit of this change:

Some of us have a hard time keeping track of which Priority Pass card is from which credit card issuer so that problem is solved if you’re using the credit card as such; this matters for credits at Priority Pass restaurants

Personally I’ll keep traveling with some of my Priority Pass cards since it’s noted that “some locations are unable to accept payment cards for entry” and I also wonder how well lounge agents will be trained on this development

Where I see the most value here is for family members and friends who don’t enjoy traveling with dozens of cards in their wallet (I know what’s wrong with them?!) or who easily lose or misplace their Priority Pass cards; this solves that issue

Bottom line

Those with the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card can now use their payment card to directly access Priority Pass lounges rather than having to use the Priority Pass app or membership card. I’d say that’s a great development because for many it will translate to one less card to carry around.

Anyone happy to see this improvement from Priority Pass?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RvbGx5LXBhcnRvbi10b3VyLWJ1cy1ob3RlbC1zdWl0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dolly Parton just turned her glittery tour bus into the ultimate Tennessee hotel suite,"For about 15 years Dolly Parton — the Queen of Country Music and probably the closest thing we have to a living angel — lived much of her life on a Prevost tour bus crisscrossing the country.

It was on that bus between 2008 and 2022 that Dolly wrote the ""Backwoods Barbie"" album and ""9 to 5 The Musical"" and traveled to more than 60 cities on the ""Pure & Simple"" tour. (This included a stop in New York City where I sang my heart out with other adoring fans.)

Preferring the comforts of home on her highly customized bus over flying Dolly had the entire space decked out to include a bathtub and a wig cabinet (for the most precious of her cargo). She even had a full-size refrigerator installed — which required removing the bus's front windshield to fit it in — just so she could cook for her crew while on the road.

It sleeps two people and those lucky enough to spend a night on the bus get to relax while surrounded by hand-painted murals representing ""wayfaring wanderers wagons and crystal balls."" The bus is complete with jewel-toned fabrics and decor that only Dolly could pull off.

Beyond the wigs and rhinestoned Dolly paraphernalia including towering high-heeled shoes and a ribbon-adorned tambourine guests also have access to a dedicated concierge team for the entire stay. Plus they'll receive one-of-a-kind food offerings and a collection of customized keepsakes to keep as souvenirs such as a bottle of her perfume ""Scent from Above."" (It smells great I preordered the sample when it was announced last year.)

Dolly famously said ""It costs a lot to look this cheap"" and it also costs a lot to stay on the tour bus. Stays require a two-night minimum and start at $10000. However in true Dolly fashion portions of the proceeds will go to The Dollywood Foundation — her organization that funds Dolly Parton's Imagination Library a program that gives free books to children from birth to the age of 5.

For folks looking to spend less on a pilgrimage to Dolly's ""Tennessee Mountain Home"" there are still plenty of ways to get a taste of her legendary history. Inside Dollywood guests can explore a tour bus from another era of her decadeslong career or step inside a replica of her childhood home.

Next fall Dollywood's HeartSong Lodge & Resort will finally open its doors after much anticipation. With 302 rooms and suites plus a 4000-square-foot four-story atrium lobby this long-awaited resort — part of the park's half-billion-dollar investment in its future — will be just another reason to head to the Great Smoky Mountains."

CCL,Carnival,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2NhcHRhaW4uY29tL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1wcm9maXQtc3Ryb25nLWRlbWFuZC1ibHVudHMtaGlnaC1jb3N0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Profit Soars Amidst Demand & Cost Management,"(Reuters) – Carnival Corp CCL.N CCL.L on Friday forecast a core profit for the current quarter as the cruise operator returns to full operations even as decades-high inflation and surging fuel costs continue to bite.

Shares of the company which have fallen 52% this year were up about 10% as Carnival also said it expects bookings for the whole of 2023 to be at the top end of their historical range and to benefit from higher prices.

“Concerning the threat of global recession while not recession-proof our business has proven to be recession-resilient time and again” Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said on a post-earnings call.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) removed its COVID-19 notice against cruise travel in March almost two years after introducing a warning scale.

The CDC’s move has been encouraging more people to travel on cruises boosting bookings for companies like Carnival that now has a majority of its fleet back on water.

As of Friday 91% of the company’s capacity is in guest cruise operation as part of its ongoing return to service.

Carnival expects positive adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the third quarter compared with the negative $900 million it recorded in the second quarter. The company’s EBITDA has been negative since the start of the pandemic.

However it still expects a loss for the year as it faces a setback from inflation and surging fuel prices that has been aggravated due to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

The company’s revenue soared to $2.40 billion in the second quarter from $50 million a year earlier but below analysts’ average estimate of $2.77 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Excluding items the company reported a loss of $1.64 per share bigger than estimates of $1.17.

That despite the fact it lost a big chunk of money in the second quarter of 2022 things are actually far better than they’ve been in nearly two years. This news comes only a few months before the upcoming departure of current CEO Arnold Donald who will step down from that position in August.

By The Numbers

Carnival Corporation’s latest financial docs indicate that despite showing a $1.9 billion loss for the second quarter of 2022 the company is actually cash-flow positive for the first time since the cruise industry shutdown.

This is huge development coming as it does as the entire industry continues clawing its way back from the nearly two-year period during which they had practically no money coming in even as they were forced to spend vast sums to keep their fleets prepared for a return.

The company noted that the second quarter was its best in terms of booking volume since the start of the pandemic nearly doubling from the previous quarter.

In total the company saw guest occupancy increase by 15 percent rising from 54 percent earlier this year to 69 percent in Q2.

Guests Have Money to Burn

The second quarter saw 1.6 million passengers cruise across the company’s nine brands. But the real bright spot from a financial point of view continued to be on-board spending which has steadily increased since the resumption of cruising.

In the second quarter that number reached $1.1 billion as passengers spent on extras such as drink packages restaurants spa treatments shore excursions booked through the lines and in the casino.

One question which has to be on the mind of every cruise line executive is how the current economic situation will impact people’s future vacation plans. As inflation and household expenses continue to rise will would-be cruisers find themselves having to cancel vacations or at the very least cut back on the money they spend once on board?

What Comes Next

“We are aggressively yet thoughtfully ramping up to full operations with over 90 percent of the fleet now in service” Donald reported. “We are driving occupancy higher while at the same time significantly increasing available capacity resulting in a nearly 50 percent sequential improvement in revenue in the second quarter despite facing constantly changing and far more restrictive protocols than broader society and travel at large.”

He continued: “As friction from protocols is removed and society becomes increasingly more comfortable managing the virus we expect to see demand continue to build as we have already seen with the strength in Carnival Cruise Line’s closer-to-home cruises.”

From Headwind to Tailwind

During the shutdown Carnival Corporation was bleeding billions of dollars quarterly what with having to repatriate crew keep its ships maintained and run shoreside operations. In order to keep the proverbial lights on the company eventually opted to sell 23 ships and take on $35 billion in total debt.

Even as the industry finally began moving toward a resumption of services the expenses continued to rack up. Crew needed to be brought back new and ever-changing health protocols had to be implemented and ships that had been dormant for months had to be brought back on line.

Always however we heard talk of the “demand for cruising” among the landlocked audience. And sure enough as ships began sailing passengers returned in droves. Now even the reluctant-to-cruise consumers are beginning to step away from the sidelines and into the buffet line creating additional demand and revenue.

Earlier this week the company announced a partnership called ‘Costa by Carnival’ which will see two of Carnival Corporation’s Italian-branded Costa ships — Costa Venezia and Costa Firenze — joining the Carnival Cruise Line fleet in 2023 and 2024 respectively.

Smoother Seas Ahead?

Cruise bookings remain strong going into next year with cruise fares on the higher end of the historical range when compared to 2019.

The summer months (Q3) are when cruise lines make a fair share of its revenue capitalizing on families filling up the third and fourth beds in the stateroom.

For reference Q3 in 2019 which was a record year for the company saw $6.5 billion in gross revenue.\

China made a big statement about its naval ambitions with the recent launch of its third and most advanced aircraft carrier.

The Fujian – by far China’s biggest most modern and most powerful aircraft carrier to date – is the 80000-ton jewel in the crown of a military expansion that has seen Beijing grow its navy into the world’s largest.

Its new combat systems – such as an electromagnetic catapult-assisted launch system – show China is fast catching up with the United States experts say and will give it the ability to launch more aircraft more quickly and with more ammunition.

That should be enough to give any would-be opponent pause for thought especially given China’s increasing aggression in its territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea a host of Southeast Asian nations in the South China Sea and its repeated harassment of the self-governed island of Taiwan – where it has pointedly refused to rule out an invasion.

Still while the launch of the Fujian amid much fanfare was clearly meant as a message to Beijing’s rivals analysts caution against swallowing too much of the hype just yet.

Firstly the Fujian likely won’t be operational for another three to four years said Carl Schuster a former US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. And even when it is operational its size will make it an obvious target – any enemy will be keenly aware that sinking such an iconic vessel would be as much of a morale blow as a military disaster for China.

Then there is the simple fact that impressive as they seem aircraft carriers aren’t necessarily best suited to what experts see as the most plausible conflict scenarios in the near future – including clashes in the East and South China Seas and an invasion of Taiwan.

Essentially experts say the Fujian might be China’s biggest ship but it’s probably not the biggest problem on the minds of US naval commanders right now.

Here are four types of ship at China’s disposal that arguably pose a far greater threat to US naval dominance.

Type 055 destroyer

Launched in 2017 these 13000-ton stealth guided-missile destroyers are considered by many to be the most powerful surface combatants in the world.

The Type 055 big enough to be considered a cruiser by NATO standards is equipped with 112 vertical launch tubes that can used to fire everything from anti-ship missiles to long-range land-attack missiles.

“This ship in particular has a sophisticated design stealth features radars and a large missile inventory. It is larger and more powerful than most US Japanese and South Korean destroyers” RAND Corp. senior analyst Timothy Heath told CNN in 2018 when Beijing launched two of the warships in a single day – a testament to China’s impressive shipbuilding capabilities.

A US Congressional Research Service report in March said at least 10 Type 055s are thought to have been launched or are under construction.

The deployment of the Lhasa the second of Beijing’s five active Type 055s to the Sea of Japan for drills amid growing tensions over Taiwan was championed by China’s state-run Global Times tabloid last week.

“The ship has achieved full operational capability and demonstrated its capabilities in deterring possible foreign military interference in the Taiwan Strait at a time when the US and Japan have been repeatedly provoking China over the Taiwan question” the Global Times reported.

The potency of the Type 055 was underlined in footage that emerged on social media in April. It showed one launching what naval analyst H I Sutton said was a hypersonic YJ-21 anti-ship ballistic missile – a weapon often referred to as a “carrier killer.”

Global Times played down the footage describing the missiles as part of the country’s defensive strategy.

“If the US does not make military provocations against China including over the Taiwan question it does not need to worry about the missiles” it said.

Type 039 submarine

These Yuan-class submarines are almost silent diesel-electric-powered boats with capabilities that could prove tough for US military planners to deal with.

Beijing has built 17 of the Type 39A/B subs with plans to increase that total to 25 in the next three years according to the US Defense Department’s 2021 report to Congress on China’s military power.

“The Type 039 SSs provide formidable ‘defense in depth’” in waters close to China “and they appear to be developing some capability to engage” US forces farther out to sea Schuster said.

The subs are equipped with air independent propulsion (AIP) which means they do not need to surface as frequently to get the air required for diesel combustion which can then power their batteries.

“When operating on batteries AIP-equipped submarines are almost silent with the only noise coming from the shaft bearings propeller and flow around the hull” US Navy officers Michael Walker and Austin Krusz wrote in a 2018 report for the US Naval Institute’s Proceedings magazine.

China is pushing to launch more of the super-quiet subs which are armed with anti-ship cruise missiles the Defense Department report said.

One potent method of attack used by the Type 039 is to fire a “wake-homing” torpedo across the stern or back of a target vessel. The torpedo then follows in the wake of the target ship before exploding near its propulsion and steering systems.

Because surface ships detect submarines and torpedoes by sound waves wake-homing torpedoes are particularly tough to defend against.

The advances in Chinese submarines come just as the US Navy is experiencing trouble with its anti-submarine capabilities.

Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday told Congress last month that the service wants to scrap nine of its littoral combat ships some of the newest ships in the US fleet because their anti-submarine systems “did not work out technically.”

Merchant ferries

Merchant ferries might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think about deadly naval capabilities – but therein lies their power.

To invade Taiwan China would likely need to transport an invading force of hundreds of thousands of men – some analysts have suggested more than a million would be needed.

Various analysts – and US government reports – have concluded the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) naval fleet is not up to that task.

But what China does have is a massive fleet of civilian ferries that could be swiftly converted for military use – and according to some may even have been designed for just that possibility.

“China’s biggest ferry shipbuilder stated publicly in 2015 that one of its largest roll-on/roll-off ferries was built for dual military and civilian purposes and one of China’s largest ferry operators has been similarly described as having a dual civil-military development philosophy” Thomas Shugart a former US Navy submarine commander now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security wrote in a 2021 essay for War on the Rocks.

He added that civilian ferry companies operating in the Yellow and South China Seas have already been organized into PLA auxiliary units.

Crunching the numbers said Shugart was staggering. He estimated that using civilian ships would give China an extra 1.1 million displacement tonnes. That figure is more than three times the displacement tonnage of all of China’s amphibious assault ships put together. And if China tapped Hong Kong’s roll-on/roll-off vehicle carriers it could gain an extra 370000 tonnes of sealift according to Shugart.

Is that enough to take Taiwan by force?

That is hard to know. But Shugart said it did answer one question.

“How many transport (ships) does the Chinese military have? Very probably more than you might think.”

Maritime militia

Ferries aren’t the only supposedly civilian vessels military planners have on their radars.

Experts also accuse China of creating a maritime militia made up of more than a hundred vessels supposedly engaged in commercial fishing to enforce its wishes in disputed seas.

The militia – which Beijing denies even exists – is made up of at least 122 vessels and likely as many as 174 according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

But the actual number could be even greater. Various experts suspected the militia’s involvement when more than 200 Chinese fishing boats crowded the waters around Whitsun Reef in the South China Sea in early 2021. The reef is claimed by both China and the Philippines which described the presence of the boats as a “clear provocative action.”

“The People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia don’t fish” Schuster told CNN last year. “They have automatic weapons aboard and reinforced hulls making them very dangerous at close range. Also they have a top speed of around 18-22 knots making them faster than 90% of the world’s fishing boats.”

The militia has two main parts: professional militia boats and actual fishing boats employed by the Chinese military under a subsidy scheme according to a November report from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

The professionals lead such activities as harassing foreign drilling ships or blocking foreign fishing boats and the subsidized fishers bring pressure in numbers the CSIS report said.

And with the world’s largest fishing fleet China has plenty of reserves to call on.

About that carrier again

Still none of this is to say that the launch of the Fujian is not a significant moment.

As in the US aircraft carriers will in time become the centerpiece of the PLA’s navy – and a symbol of what the modern Chinese military is capable of Schuster said.

“Fujian’s launch should be viewed for what it portends rather than its limited immediate impact” Schuster said.

“China has now launched three carriers and brought two into full operational status during a period where the US Navy has struggled to bring one new unit to full operational status” he said.

Schuster was referring to the USS Gerald Ford a supercarrier that has been plagued by problems since its commissioning in 2017 (by which time it was already three years late).

The supercarrier is yet to make its first operational deployment though that is expected this fall.

Meanwhile China forges ahead.

“They are building their navy at a faster rate than the US and all of its allies” Schuster said.

“Imperfect but a good foundation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91ay1uZXdzLzIwMjIvanVuLzI1L3ByaW5jZS1jaGFybGVzLWlzLXNhaWQtdG8taGF2ZS1iZWVuLWdpdmVuLTNtLWluLXFhdGFyaS1jYXNo0gFraHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3VrLW5ld3MvMjAyMi9qdW4vMjUvcHJpbmNlLWNoYXJsZXMtaXMtc2FpZC10by1oYXZlLWJlZW4tZ2l2ZW4tM20taW4tcWF0YXJpLWNhc2g?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prince Charles given €3m in cash in bags by Qatari politician according to report,"The Prince of Wales accepted bags containing millions of euros in cash during meetings with a senior Qatari politician according to a report.

Prince Charles was said to have been given a total of €3m (£2.6m) during meetings with Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani the former prime minister of Qatar.

The cash was handed to the heir to the British throne in a suitcase on one occasion a holdall on another as well as in Fortnum & Mason carrier bags the up-market department store which holds a royal warrant to supply the prince’s household with groceries.

The handovers are alleged to have occurred during meetings between the two men including a private one-to-one meeting at Clarence House in 2015 it was claimed.

In a statement a Clarence House spokesperson said the money given during the 2015 meeting was “passed immediately to one of the prince’s charities who carried out the appropriate covenants and assured us that all the correct processes were followed”.

The suitcase containing the cash was given to two of Charles’ advisers who are said to have hand-counted the money. Palace aides are said to have asked Coutts the private bank which acts for the royal family to collect the cash.

Each payment was deposited into the accounts of the Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund (PWCF). There is no suggestion the payments were illegal the Sunday Times reported today.

The sheikh one of the richest people in the world was dubbed the “man who bought London” after he used his wealth as well as his influence on the Qatari Wealth fund to make huge investments in London including the Shard Harrods and the InterContinental London Park Lane. He is the owner of one of the world’s richest football clubs Paris Saint-Germain.

There is no evidence the sheikh did not intend the monies to go to the charity and Hamad was unavailable for comment it was reported.

The chair of the trustees to the charity confirmed to the newspaper that the 2015 donation was made and then the trustees who have a legal duty to protect the charity’s reputation “discussed the governance and donor relationship (confirming that the donor was a legitimate and verified counterparty) and our auditors signed off on the donation after a specific enquiry during the audit. There was no failure of governance”.

The charity is said to have confirmed the 2015 donation was made in cash at the “donor’s choice”.

Charles and Hamad are said to have a relationship going back several decades. In 2010 Charles was said to have lobbied Hamad to shelve the £3bn redevelopment of London’s Chelsea Barracks – writing a letter in which he told the country’s then prime minister that the state-backed Qatari Diar’s proposed steel-and-glass design “made my heart sink”. Charles later met the emir of Qatar for tea at Clarence House where the topic was raised once again. Qatar subsequently pulled the plans prompting the Candy brothers who were overseeing the development to launch a £81m lawsuit. In it they accused Qatar of caving in to the prince’s demands.

The latest claims come at an embarrassing time for the prince. Clarence House has rebutted claims of a “cash-for-access” culture in his organisation with the Metropolitan police and the Charity Commission investigating fundraising practices including the sale of honours. It has been alleged that Charles’s closest confidant Michael Fawcett secured an honour for a Saudi billionaire.

Fawcett resigned from his position in Charles’s inner circle in March 2003 after a report by Sir Michael Peat identified mismanagement at Clarence House. The Peat inquiry found that Fawcett had accepted “numerous gifts in the course of his royal service” but cleared him of any financial impropriety. Fawcett continued to work for Charles on a freelance basis as a fixer and party planner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hdmlhbmNhLWFlcm9tZXhpY28tbGF0YW0tY2hhcHRlci0xMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Look Back At Avianca Aeromexico & LATAM's Chapter 11s,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hdmlhbmNhLWFlcm9tZXhpY28tbGF0YW0tY2hhcHRlci0xMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjIvMDYvMjUvdmVoaWNsZS1tYWtlcnMtY291cnQtZXVyb3Blcy1taWxpdGFyaWVzLXdpdGgtaHlicmlkLWVsZWN0cmljLXJpZGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vehicle makers court Europe's militaries with hybrid electric rides,"PARIS — Gone are the days when military vehicles simply need to roll. Now they must come equipped with complex communications systems radars lasers jammers and other electronic systems turning battlefield rides into mobile power stations.

European vehicle makers have been quick to jump on the business case for electric propulsion offering products that promise to satisfy militaries’ needs for more efficient energy storage quieter motors and lower thermal signatures. Last week they showed their latest and greatest tech on the floor of the biennial Eurosatory trade conference held outside Paris.

But while the civilian vehicle world has successfully deployed hybrid and electric cars onto city streets the defense sector — now able to take advantage of those civilian technological advances— is just getting started.

Industry leaders told Defense News how the rhetoric around hybrid and all-electric vehicles particularly tactical versions has shifted over the past few years as nations balance increasingly augmented energy needs against rising fuel prices while also tackling challenges brought on by climate change within their services.

Nexter has been working on hybrid technology for about 20 years said Sebastien Roy the company’s energy research and technology leader. The French firm developed an initial hybrid demonstrator from 2003 to 2004 — not in response to a specific requirement but merely to begin evaluating the technology Roy said in an interview at Nexter’s pavilion.

Since then the company has been able to take advantage of the new hybrid propulsion technologies under development in the civil vehicle industry some of which are more compact and capable especially when it comes to batteries. “It’s really those technological evolutions in the civil world that have allowed us to say: ‘OK we will soon be able to integrate them into military vehicles’ ” Roy said.

The rhetoric around electric and hybrid tactical vehicles at the convention center was much louder than what attendees heard at the same show four years ago. Demonstrators were spread across the corners of the show floor from Arquus’ Scarabee light armored vehicle with a fully hybrid powertrain to FFG’s bright-blue eight-wheel drive Genesis armored personnel carrier.

FFG developed the Genesis demonstrator purely to examine the possibilities of a hybrid system on a tank said Michael Moller the German company’s vice president for special technology.

Engineers wanted to “have the knowledge to be … a very early one on the market to know how to handle this technology high-voltage systems how to build it to maintain it” he told Defense News at the company’s booth. The Genesis was developed five years ago and debuted at an FFG event in 2021 he added.

French company Texelis displayed a full-scale model of its four-wheel drive MR400 armored vehicle at its booth which features a new in-wheel electric-hub drive developed jointly with U.K.-based QinetiQ. The MR400 is derived from Texelis’ vehicle design for the French Army’s VBMR Serval multirole vehicle program. Texelis — which was part of the Volvo Group until 2008 — and Nexter are co-prime contractors for the program.

When the Serval design was undergoing development four years ago Texelis was already thinking about integrating a hybrid propulsion system said Sebastien Guillon the company’s export sales director. While no one has requested that requirement talks are ongoing and Texelis is “already thinking about what the configuration will be” he told Defense News at the conference. “What we understood is that it should be something very quick” to integrate and install onto a future Serval vehicle he added.

Meanwhile General Dynamics European Land Systems introduced a fully electric version of its four-wheel drive DURO all-terrain tactical vehicle at the conference. The DURO-e features a variable powertrain that includes a diesel engine and a pure electric powertrain that comes in either a battery- or fuel cell-powered version along with capabilities including silent drive boost and extended silent watch per the company. The DURO-e claims a low heat and noise signature along with high-energy efficiency and a self-sufficient energy supply.

General Dynamics partnered with Magna Powertrain’s Austria-based Engineering Center-Steyr and Switzerland-based Phi-Power AG to produce DURO-e the company said in a news release. The original DURO was designed for the Swiss military.

Rheinmetall also is evaluating hybrid and electric technologies for its future vehicles company officials said at the show. On the sidelines of its pavilion at Eurosatory the German firm set up a space it called the Technology Cube designed for discussions about future vehicle requirements with existing and potential customers. Delegations could be seen moving in and out of the space including senior leaders of the Hungarian army which committed to procuring Rheinmetall’s Lynx infantry fighting vehicle.

The French Army’s hybrid future

The French Armed Forces Ministry has particularly focused on finding solutions for more efficient energy storage as military vehicles are increasingly used for more electronic capabilities such as communications systems lasers radars and jammers.

Former Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly oversaw the release of the ministry’s first defense and energy strategy in 2020  and several months ago released the first defense and climate change strategy . The recommendations in those documents include a hybrid vehicle demonstrator based on the Griffon light armored vehicle meant to complete testing by 2025 and inform future hybrid truck requirements.

Arquus Nexter and Thales are jointly developing the hybrid demonstrator and the team is undergoing testing evaluation and integration efforts that will help the ministry decide whether to launch large-scale production according to an Arquus spokesperson.

The French Army’s future program to build a new armored engagement support vehicle dubbed VBAE may include a requirement for hybrid propulsion. Arquus pitched a hybrid light armored vehicle likely based on its Scarabee light reconnaissance vehicle in anticipation of that requirement the spokesperson said. The Scarabee vehicle debuted in 2018 and was developed to respond to what Arquus thought could be the VBAE requirements and to reflect the company’s vision of what a next-generation reconnaissance vehicle could look like the spokesperson added.

Nexter which has employed hybrid propulsion on its robotic systems already is also exploring the technology for its own submission to the VBAE program Roy said. It expects to have a demonstrator ready around 2025.

Soframe a subsidiary of the French group Lohr revealed last year its planned submission for the VBAE program which will also undergo designs to integrate a fully electric or hybrid propulsion mode according to local reports .

The future Main Ground Combat System — a tank in development by France and Germany — might also feature hybrid propulsion technology. KNDS the joint holding company that includes Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and France’s Nexter is developing the tank that is expected to be fielded around 2035. Arquus is a subcontractor on that program.

Technical challenges

One ongoing challenge relates to the cooling system of a hybrid vehicle which makes it difficult to integrate hybrid propulsion into military applications Nexter’s Roy noted. But as this technology matures in the civilian world the company imagines being able to overcome this problem in the near future.

Energy storage also remains a challenge. “Batteries are changing very fast” said FFG’s Moller. Developing batteries that have better performance and are lighter and more easily replaceable will be key moving forward he added.

Some stakeholders noted that the market for hybrid military vehicles remains limited. The demonstrators on the Eurosatory show floor were overwhelmingly tactical vehicles and officials may not be ready to expand their interest in hybrid technologies beyond those capabilities industry leaders noted.

Sweden’s Volvo has been developing hybrid and electric vehicles for nearly two decades now primarily to serve its customers in the civilian sector. Its defense subsidiary focuses on heavy vehicles such as logistics trucks that drive over extended distances.

So far while officials are expressing interest in alternative fuel solutions there has been little demonstrable effort to actually “hybridize” those types of vehicles for the military Andreas Svenungsson head of Volvo Defense told Defense News at Eurosatory.

For now tactical vehicles appear to have the best use case scenario for hybrid or electric propulsion vehicles due to the operational benefits of quieter motors and lower thermal signatures he noted. But for the vehicles Volvo produces “we have not seen it [hybrid or electric propulsion] in the tenders or the requirements so far” he added.

He also noted that military programs have the added considerations of maintaining a secure supply chain and steady access to fuel that remain challenges for the hybridization of ground vehicles.

But thanks to Volvo’s ongoing electric and hybrid propulsion efforts for civilian trucks and buses “if they want to procure this for the defense segment we are ready” he added.

It was clear to these companies that the drumbeat for hybrid military vehicles is only getting louder. Years ago officials were talking about the possibility of hybrid vehicles but without any “real requirements” noted Texelis’ Guillon.

“Now I think they have a clear vision” spurred by environmental targets or the need for “silent mode” capabilities and energy storage he said. “It will help us because the way we want to develop something it should be useful for the customer and not just be hybrid by name.”

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

There are nearly 1 million known insect species on Earth and just 2% of these insects are harmful to plants animals or humans.

Managing insects in the vegetable garden and home landscape requires an understanding of which insects are actually beneficial to plants or animals (the good) which are harmful to the plants we tend (the bad) and which are just strange curiosities of nature (the ugly).

Most of the time populations of insects that have the potential to cause damage to plants remain below the threshold in which widespread damage occurs because of biological factors such as the presence of predators and parasites as well as environmental factors such as weather and soil moisture.

Beneficial insects the good guys in the garden

As opposed to eradicating all insects from the garden a gardener’s goal should be to create an environment where populations of beneficial insects thrive and naturally keep the populations of harmful insects in check.

Beneficial insects that help to control harmful insects include lady beetles green lacewings hover flies paper wasps and soldier beetles.

Gardening:What is a rain garden and how can it help my landscape plants and flowers?

Gardeners can help maintain populations of beneficial insects by providing habitat and a food source for these insects.

Flowering herbaceous perennials that produce a large amount of pollen or nectar such as yarrow milkweed and daisies are excellent food sources for many beneficial insects.

Vary insect control tactics

Relying only on synthetic insecticides to control harmful insects also harms beneficial insects as well as bees and other pollinators.

When attempting to control harmful pests gardeners should use an Integrated Pest Management approach in which biological and cultural controls are utilized before chemical controls are used.

Cultural controls include tactics such as using row covers as a barrier to exclude insects from plants planting varieties that are resistant to insects or diseases planting a trap crop to lure insects away from other crops and even hand-picking insects to prevent damage.

When chemical controls are used consider using natural products such as insecticidal soaps horticultural oils and botanicals saving synthetic chemical insecticides as a last resort to prevent widespread damage to plants.

Top 10 most common harmful insects

Depending upon which vegetables you are growing here is a list of the 10 most common harmful insects you may encounter in your vegetable garden and non-chemical control options for each pest:

• Tomato hornworm: This large menacing-looking finger-sized lime-green caterpillar can quickly defoliate tomato plants in late summer with their voracious appetites.

Control options include picking the caterpillars by hand and dropping them into a bucket of soapy water. Many times a parasitic wasp lays eggs on these insects which kill the hornworms. If you see hornworms with what looks like white grains of rice embedded in the insect let nature take its course so that the wasps hatch and find more hornworms to parasitize.

• Flea beetle: These tiny pinhead-sized black bugs chew small holes in lettuce spinach and other greens and the leaves of their favorite food — eggplant. Populations of this insect explode in hot dry weather.

Non-chemical control options include the use of insecticidal soaps diatomaceous earth and the use of floating row covers. Be sure to remove row covers when crops such as eggplant flower.

• Cucumber beetle: These small beetles with yellow strips or spots feed primarily on cucumbers but can also attack squashes and sometimes melons. The insect spreads a bacterial wilt and a mosaic virus that quickly kill entire plants.

Non-chemical controls include the use of row covers delaying planting date until late June and application of a pyrethrin which is a botanical insecticide.

• Squash bug: These shield-shaped hard-shelled insects suck plant juices causing squashes and pumpkin plants to wilt and die.

Non-chemical controls include handpicking of insects and their eggs which can be found on the underside of leaves and applications of insecticidal soap pyrethrins or neem oil.

• Cabbage worms: The adults of these small white moths lay eggs that turn into green caterpillars that chew on cabbage broccoli cauliflower and Brussel sprouts.

Non-chemical control options include handpicking and the use of row covers.

Gardening:Invasive Asian jumping worms are wreaking havoc in Ohio soils

• Squash vine borer: These wasp-like moths lay eggs at the base of squashes and pumpkin plants. Larvae hatch into fat caterpillars that feed inside the stem eventually killing the plant.

Non-chemical controls include hand removal of caterpillars or wrapping stems with tin foil.

• Colorado potato beetle: This yellow-and black-striped beetle skeletonizes leaves of potato and occasionally tomato eggplant and peppers.

Handpicking is the simplest non-chemical control option.

• Aphids: These small soft-bodied insects suck plant juices from peas broccoli and other cool-season crops leaving behind a sticky substance called honeydew that attracts ants.

Applications of insecticidal soaps or oils or even a stiff spray of water from a garden hose will control these insects.

• Mexican bean beetle: These pea-sized yellow- to orange-red beetles with black spots skeletonize leaves of most bean plants.

Row covers and applications of insecticidal soaps or oils will control this insect.

• Corn earworm: Adults of this insect lay eggs on fresh silks of sweet corn and the larvae feed on corn kernels at the tip of the ear.

Encouraging beneficial insects such as lady beetles and planting sweet corn early will help to control this insect.

These caterpillars can strip an evergreen branch leaving it permanently bare.

I have never really seen a bagworm infestation kill a large tree but I have seen it totally defoliate a small evergreen shrub making it really difficult for the plant to survive.

On deciduous plants since they lose their leaves bagworms aren’t generally a big problem. The caution is to make sure they don’t move on to nearby preferred evergreens.

Credit: Contributed Credit: Contributed

Most gardeners don’t recognize bagworms until later in the season usually around September. This is about the time when their “bags” turn brown and are noticeable.

However if you find them now they are easily controlled by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) a very safe pesticide that eliminates the small caterpillars.

Once caterpillars are bigger Bt is not effective and you have to switch to another pesticide.

Bagworms feed on foliage and in the early stages use pieces of the foliage to make a protective house or cocoon-like structure. This protective house really does a good job of keeping them safe.

Explore Housekeeping position leads to woman building a career in caregiving

The silk used to build this cocoon structure is really strong. If you have ever picked one off of a plant and tried to pull it apart you know what I mean.

These cocoons are what you see in September. Right now they are about one-eighth to one-quarter of an inch long. They have really tiny pieces of foliage covering them. This covering resembles an upside-down dunce-cap protruding from the foliage.

As I mentioned they are really small and you have to look for them. Start looking on those plants you might have had bagworms feeding in the past.

If you don’t want to use pesticides you can hand-pick and destroy the bags. This is usually a little easier to do when they are a bit larger.

I don’t normally worry about using pesticides on trees and shrubs unless the pest has a potential to really damage a plant.

In this case I recommend using pesticides to eliminate as many of these bagworms as possible especially on your evergreens.

Stripping of the foliage is stressful to a plant and should be avoided. Look for newly-hatched bagworms now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay93aGF0cy1vbi93aGF0cy1vbi1uZXdzL3BpdHRlZC1jb2xpbi1jdXRoYmVydC1jYXRlcnBpbGxhci1jYWtlcy0yNDI4NTYwMNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay93aGF0cy1vbi93aGF0cy1vbi1uZXdzL3BpdHRlZC1jb2xpbi1jdXRoYmVydC1jYXRlcnBpbGxhci1jYWtlcy0yNDI4NTYwMC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caterpillar cakes: I pitted Colin and Cuthbert against their supermarket rivals,"Subscribe to our daily What's On newsletter to keep up with what's happening around Greater Manchester

Now more than ever caterpillar cakes are the must-have centrepiece for children’s birthday parties BBQs picnics and literally any other excuse to eat cake - housewarmings engagements Thursdays you name it.

There’s been much talk about supermarket caterpillar cakes over the last few years after a lawsuit was filed against Aldi’s Cuthbert the Caterpillar by M&S who said it was too similar to their popular 30-year-old design of Colin.

The brands have since called a truce and Cuthbert recently reemerged on supermarket shelves with an ever-so-slightly different design with Aldi very much making light of the rivalry online.

READ MORE:I rushed to buy Aldi Cuthbert the Caterpillar as cake hits shelves for first time in 15 months

But as you know Aldi and M&S aren’t the only supermarkets to have their own notorious novelty desserts with Morrisons Tesco Sainsbury’s Asda and even Home Bargains having their own incarnation of a caterpillar cake too.

This week I decided to head out and buy one of every caterpillar cake I could find to pit the oversized chocolate rolls against one another to find the true birthday cake champion - and I found a rather unlikely winner.

I headed out to each of the supermarkets in search of Colin Cuthbert Curly Clyde Wiggles Morris and Claude the caterpillars and was able to get each one in the first store I came to - besides Colin who was out of stock in the first M&S I visited however there were plenty in the second.

Sitting side by side in my fridge the caterpillar army looked rather menacing rather than screaming ‘birthday party fun’ each glaring out of their little plastic window out into the kitchen.

The following day I rated the caterpillar cakes on their serving size design price taste and how much of a mess they left in my kitchen and some scored much higher than others. Here are all the cakes I tested:

Asda - Clyde the Caterpillar

Sainsbury’s - Wiggles the Caterpillar

Aldi - Cuthbert the Caterpillar

M&S - Colin the Caterpillar

Tesco - Curly the Caterpillar

Home Bargains - Claude the Caterpillar

Morrisons - Morris the Caterpillar

Box design

Arguably the least important element of this review or so one might think is the box design. Each of the boxes have a green theme except Asda’s whose is more yellow. Some brands like M&S and Home Bargains have gone for a leafy design while Morrisons Aldi and Asda’s were much more colourful.

I did find that M&S’s box and Home Bargains’ boxes were the best for carrying as the plastic windows didn’t collapse in on themselves nearly crushing the cake as they had a bit more structure to them however M&S’s cake doesn’t show a caterpillar face on the end of the box and so he looks like he’s in some sort of solitary confinement when placed in a line up

Price and serving size

Marks and Spencer had the most expensive caterpillar cake weighing in at £8 followed by Asda Sainsbury’s and Tesco who are all at the lower price of £6.50. Morrisons has undercut the other mid-range supermarkets at £5.99 while Aldi is cheaper still at £4.99. However it was Home Bargains that was the lowest cost coming in at just £3.99.

Each of the cakes weigh roughly the same around 625g though Sainsbury’s cake is denser at 627g though the estimated serving suggestions do vary meaning the size of your slice will too.

Colin the Caterpillar from M&S is said to serve 10 while every other cake is said to serve 12 with the exception of Sainsbury’s who claim Wiggles can serve 14 - though for the extra 2g of chocolate I feel their portions would be significantly smaller.

Face

Lining up the caterpillar cakes was really rather frightening - have you ever looked a Colin the Caterpillar in the eyes? He’s really quite menacing actually.

Most of the caterpillar cakes opted for a white chocolate face like the OG Colin with the exception of Asda and Tesco. Asda’s Clyde the Caterpillar actually looks more like Shrek with his green face and red nose I’m not sure why they thought it was a good idea but it does make him look as though he’s just come off Oblivion at Alton Towers.

Meanwhile Curly has a face only a mother could love and is truly the stuff of nightmares. If I was given a Curly the Caterpillar cake for my birthday at the age of seven I can almost guarantee that 20 years later I’d be on a This Morning phone telling the Speakmans I have a caterpillar phobia.

Most similar to Colin’s face isn’t Cuthbert but actually Wiggles both with milk chocolate eyes and sticking their tongue out. Home Bargains’ Claude is the only chocolate face to be printed on and while there’s nothing wrong with Morris the Caterpillar’s face it’s definitely Aldi who has mastered the balance between fun cute and smartly dressed with the new addition of Cuthbert’s bow tie.

Decoration

Taking a bird’s eye view of the cakes some look much more fun than others. Asda’s Clyde features a smooth surface with hundreds and thousands and chocolate balls in a multitude of colours plus orange fondant feet while Sainsburys caterpillar cake opts for sprinkles and red green and yellow Smarties style confectionery and four white chocolate trainers that make him look like he’s missing two feet at the back.

Cuthbert has a more ridge-like design with six white chocolate feet and colourful sprinkles and his rival Colin also has six white chocolate feet and only yellow and green chocolate pieces.

Curly while having a smooth chocolate finish has been drizzled with white chocolate and sprinkled with vibrant chocolate pieces in blues pinks greens and oranges. Meanwhile Home Bargains’ smooth cake has hundreds and thousands and a rainbow of chocolate pieces and is the only cake to not have feet. Morris has gone for orange yellow and green chocolate with sprinkles in a more muted colour palette.

Best for cutting

Cutting into a caterpillar cake is no mean feat and frankly requires a skill I don’t possess. I cut the back slice off each of the caterpillar cakes for a taste test and while some left crumbling chocolate all over my dining table others provided a much cleaner mess-free cut.

Cuthbert and Colin were both the hardest to slice due to the ridges in their chocolate shell but the easiest ones to divide up were Tesco’s Curly and Home Bargains’ Claude.

Each of the cakes come on their own board which avoids most of the mess being in the kitchen except for Home Bargains’ whose cake is boardless. You may want to place Claude on a chopping board if serving him up for guests.

Taste test

The most important part right? Three cake aficionados - that’s me and my parents - each tasted all of the different supermarket caterpillar cakes and it was two against one for the best.

We all found Cuthbert to be on the dry side while M&S’s Colin was clearly the richest - though it must be said that whoever gets the back slice of a Colin the Caterpillar really pulled the short straw as his tail tapers off.

Tesco and Morrisons’ cakes were both moist and tasted very chocolatey while Asda’s was more sugary and not rich enough. Sainsbury’s cake ranked highly for it’s light and fluffy sponge texture but it was Home Bargains once again that surprised us with having vanilla filling rather than chocolate and offered a light and tasty sponge.

Verdict

If I were having a birthday party Clyde and Curly definitely would not be invited because frankly I find them a little bit scary. That said none of the actual cakes themselves were bad - though I can’t say I’ve ever had a bad chocolate cake.

Cuthbert and Colin were both fab party pieces and I have it on good authority that warmed up with a bit of double cream Cuth’s dry sponge isn’t all that bad while Morris and Wiggles were also pretty good contenders for a cheap birthday cake.

But scoring highly for box sturdiness ease of division design flavour and being the cheapest of the whole bunch Claude the Caterpillar from Home Bargains was my unlikely favourite and would 100 per cent be head of the table at my next shindig. It was the vanilla cream that really set him apart.

It's one thing to hear about something and it's another to see it. To that end Frushour and Rasmussen brought some newly emerged monarch butterflies and caterpillars to the garden for children to see. After teaching the kids about butterflies Frushour and Rasmussen released the monarchs high into the sky to continue their life spans.

Following the display and release of the monarchs children got busy coloring in their own butterfly masks to take home."

But they take on added attention when so little verifiable large-scale activity is taking place in the commercial office market these early summer days.

One tale that has tantalized the commercial brokerage world for months is that Cushman & Wakefield and Newmark the city’s Nos. 2 and 3 brokerages by leasing and sales volume behind leader CBRE plan to merge. It was part of the buzz at the Real Estate Board of New York’s glittering gala gathering at the Glasshouse event space on Thursday night.

One insider at the bash told us “I think that cratered a long time ago.” But another said in a near-whisper “It did fall apart but now it’s on again.”

A Cushman rep declined to comment. A 2020 Bloomberg story incorrectly said that Newmark had rebuffed a Cushman takeover bid. Newmark didn’t get back to us.

The merger chatter gained added currency with an inside tip to Realty Check that Cushman & Wakefield which is now based at Vornado’s 1290 Sixth Ave. secretly signed a lease to move its offices to 220000 square feet at Brookfield’s 660 Fifth Avenue.

According to this intriguing but unconfirmed tale the lease is under wraps pending the outcome of the Cushman-Newmark merger discussions. A Brookfield rep acknowledged there were “talks” for a possible lease but denied that a deal was signed. A Cushman rep also denied it. But a lease would be another coup for 660 Fifth where Macquarie Group recently signed for a similar amount of space.

A high-powered Cushman team that includes global brokerage chairman Bruce Mosler happens to be the leasing agent for 660 Fifth the former 666 Fifth that’s been renamed and redesigned.

A move there would be an expansion for Cushman which has 180000 square feet at 1290 Sixth where its lease expires in 2025. Cushman’s interest in leaving 1290 Sixth when its lease is up was reported by The Real Deal earlier this month.

A Cushman-Newmark merger would likely benefit Newmark most.

Sunday more than 100000 people gathered on Hennepin Avenue to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the event. They were embraced by some of Minnesota's largest employers as well as a group of Democratic heavyweights who welcomed the crowds with a plea for political action in response to recent moves that they said threaten the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community.

Several pre-parade speakers denounced the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade noting that Justice Clarence Thomas proclaimed that the legal rationale for banning abortion should be used to overturn cases establishing rights to contraception same-sex consensual relations and same-sex marriage. The speakers urged attendees to get out and vote this fall for people who support their causes.

""They are coming for equality"" said Gov. Tim Walz who also marched in the parade next to Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan. ""They are coming for all of our rights. The good news is there's more of us. … The antidote to what we saw on Friday is you. It is all of our responsibility to create a world where every single child is seen heard loved and valued. Minnesota is that place.""

Andrea Jenkins president of the Minneapolis City Council warned the crowd that more than 300 anti-LGBTQ laws have been introduced throughout the U.S. recently with more than 100 of them passing in various states. She said conservatives are trying to legislate the LGBTQ community ""out of societal existence.""

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said the LGBTQ community has shown that it has political muscle of its own.

""Fifty years ago did we think we were going to have gay marriage? We did not"" Klobuchar told the crowd. ""Did we think we were going to get rid of things like 'Don't ask don't tell'? We did not. We have made so much progress. … This is a celebration of 50 years of progress but it is also a call for action for 50 more.""

Many crowd members said they welcomed the intrusion of politics on a day devoted to spreading messages of love inclusion and acceptance.

Pam Burd who has been coming to the Pride parade for 20 years said it was important for state leaders to show support for the LGBTQ community.

""I'm pretty disturbed by recent events"" said Burd who identifies as a gay woman. ""And I don't know what our future is. So I think our leaders need to be involved in everything that's going on.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was the most energetic politician on hand jogging down the route in shorts and pumping up the crowd outside Rock Bottom Brewery. In a call-and-responses session Frey shouted ""Happy!"" and the jubilant crowd shouted back ""Pride!""

Same-sex couples exchanged kisses and hugs sometimes on the route itself. The Timberwolves mascot drew huge cheers with his dance routine to Aretha Franklin's ""Respect."" The crowd also went delirious for bubbles and people sang along to a variety of hits.

""It was awesome"" said Tasia Desjarlait who brought her four kids to the parade for the first time. ""I feel great because the people going to the parade today feel free.""

Police said turnout was as large as before the pandemic. They reported no arrests or incidents related to the parade though a group of about 100 anti-police protesters briefly disrupted the beginning of the parade as they chanted ""No police at Pride"" and ""No justice no peace."" The group quickly moved to Loring Park organizers said.

The parade was an entertaining spectacle that lasted slightly more than two hours. Though it did not reach Mardi Gras levels there was a lot of exposed skin even though the weather never topped 70 degrees. One marcher wore nothing but a pair of white jockey shorts as he gyrated down Hennepin Avenue.

Still the parade was a fairly family-friendly event. Madusa Rose set up a face-painting station at 9th and Hennepin treating about 40 children to a free butterfly or other design.

Leaders and employees say that mindset is what makes the company great not just for customers but also for the workers serving them.

A frequent company on cleveland.com’s annual list of Top Workplaces Charles Schwab is ranked No. 1 among large companies on for 2022.

For the 2022 Top Workplaces list cleveland.com and the Plain Dealer have compiled 220 stand-out Northeast Ohio employers based on employee surveys. This year we’ve focused on employee retention. Find the full list and stories on the top three winners in each category at cleveland.com/top-workplaces.

The investment management company has just under 700 employees across four locations in Northeast Ohio. It has more than 30000 employees across the U.S. and also made Forbes “America’s Best Large Employers” list for 2022.

Catherine Golladay head of Workplace Financial Services said the company’s mission is why Schwab is consistently listed as a top place to work.

“I believe our client-first approach is a big factor in why people join Schwab and why they stay Golladay said. “Our employees are driven by the shared desire to help individuals invest in their financial futures at all levels of income during every stage of their life.

“Since day one we’ve set out to challenge the status quo looking for ways to offer our clients more value and a better experience. That really resonates with our people.”

Many employees mentioned the same thing saying the work was challenging and interesting.

“Every day I spend most of my time solving interesting little puzzles” one employee wrote in the survey. “Solving these puzzles happens to make Schwab’s products work better for their clients but it is also fun. Schwab recognizes what I do well and what I enjoy doing and lets me do that.”

Schwab has a long list of services for its customers and a lot of benefits for its employees.

Workers receive typical benefits including a 401(k) with a company match an annual bonus plan a stock purchase plan and discounts on some of the company’s services. Schwab also offers tuition reimbursement and maternity and paternity leave.

A unique offering from Schwab are paid sabbaticals. Employees can take a 28-day paid sabbatical every five years.

The company has returned to the office with a hybrid model so it can give employees flexibility. Golladay said the company also works to create an inclusive workplace where workers feel valued and regularly seeks input from employees.

Schwab also tries to keep workers informed she said. The CFO of the company hosts forums every quarter to update employees on the financials progress toward goals and major initiatives. Each business unit holds similar meetings to keep teams in the loop she said.

In such a large company Schwab said it also works to make sure employees don’t feel like just one of 30000 people.

“While we are a large organization we know that the most important relationships that drive employee satisfaction are those you have with your manager your direct team and your primary business partners so we focus on that” Golladay said.

Employees who took the survey mentioned many other reasons they liked working for Schwab like supportive leaders work-life balance.

Where there is smoke there is fire: We had heard for months that a big Goldman Sachs move was imminent for Dallas was going to be downtown and was going to bring in thousands of well-paying jobs for house-buying employees.

Now we know: On Wednesday the Dallas City Council voted to give the global financial institution more than $18 million in economic incentives to bring 5000 jobs to Dallas (2500 of which are already here) and construct an 800000-square-foot office tower part of Hunt Realty’s 11-acre North End development located between Victory Park and Uptown. The office project will be at 2323 North Field St. next to the Perot Museum.

The Dallas City Council overwhelmingly supported the incentives never balking at the price. Well except for District 14’s Paul Ridley.

“This is exactly the kind of company I think we should be investing in” said council member Cara Mendelsohn. “To me this is an investment that makes sense.” Council member Tennell Atkins said that giving Goldman Sachs support will build for the city’s future. “We are not giving away the store” Atkins said. “We are trying to sell Dallas.” Still council member Paul Ridley questioned offering the global financial firm millions in public funding.

Goldman was understandably tight-lipped regarding a potential move to Dallas as we tried to scout for clues earlier this month. The real estate community was and is ecstatic. Many have long believed that Goldman could well be the first of many New York City-based financial firms to make the move here.

“Dallas is always on the radar” said Rogers Healy owner and CEO of Rogers Healy Companies.

Healy said he has heard rumblings of the New York-based Goldman Sachs moving to Dallas “for a while.”

While noting Dallas’ downtown needs work its central location and affordability are draws for large corporations.

Although Dallas is gaining notoriety for being one the hottest real estate markets in the nation — home prices up 13.1 percent annually in April to $440000 and homes selling after 15 days — Healy said Dallas is becoming a hot spot for a key demographic: Millennials.

Healy added Millennials are moving to Dallas more than any city in the nation and “they’re moving here to call it home.”

He added while the demographic historically moves to Los Angeles New York and Chicago lower home prices and a stronger job market give Dallas “10 years or more” of runway in the housing market.

Healy however said one of the biggest issues with a potential move and Goldman Sachs’ 43000 employees is parking especially downtown. He said downtown currently doesn’t have the bandwidth to withstand that influx especially with heavy traffic already in the Uptown and Oak Lawn neighborhoods.

According to Bloomberg all Goldman Sachs says at this point is the bank continues “to grow our presence in the Dallas area but cannot comment at this time on our future expansion plans.”

But it’s no secret that Goldman and many financial giants are looking to move at least part of their operations from NYC. Other finance firms including Charles Schwab Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. have been drawn to North Texas:

The Wall Street titan has been on the hunt for a new office campus in Dallas that may become its largest presence in the US outside of Manhattan Bloomberg reported a year ago. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon has been seeking to reshape US operations to cut expenses and shift thousands of jobs to cheaper locales.

The developer is CHI/Acquisitions LP located in Montclair New Jersey. The CHI name refers to Crow Holdings Industrial. The property is owned by Hudson Properties LLC located in Pound Ridge.

According to Attorney Richard O”™Rourke of the Fishkill office of the White Plains-based law firm Keane & Beane the plan would involve subdividing the approximately 39.3 acres of land into two parcels. The lot on which the warehouse would be built would be purchased by CHI and would cover 28.9 acres. The remaining lot 10.4 acres would be retained by Hudson Properties and would be used for future development.

The Dutchess Mall opened in 1974 and was strategically located in the area where Route 9 and Interstate 84 intersected. It was the first shopping mall in Dutchess County. It originally was anchored by two department stores Mays and Luckey Platt. After a few years Jamesway opened in the space where Mays had been and Service Merchandise opened where Luckey Platt had been. Those retailers eventually moved out and a flea market opened up in the former Service Merchandise site and a branch of Dutchess Community College took the Jamesway space. The college had signed a 15-year lease for Â 47000 square feet of space and still operates there. Also at the northern end of the former mall near Dutchess Community College is a Home Depot store.

O”™Rourke pointed out that the Comprehensive Plan for the town of Fishkill that was prepared in 2009 identified the mall as being “an abandoned and underutilized property” and encouraged its redevelopment.

“The warehouse building is proposed in substantially the same location as the existing Dutchess Mall buildings with the associated off-street parking and loading docks” O”™Rourke said. “The site was also carefully designed to minimize any impacts to the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation wetland area at the rear of the property.”

O”™Rourke said that there would be 215 parking spaces provided in the proposed development 78 loading docks essentially grouped on two sides of the warehouse four drive-in ramps and 30 trailer parking spaces. He said that while Fishkill”™s Zoning Code would require 387 parking spaces for the project the developer believes that the 215 spaces being proposed would be adequate.

O”™Rourke said that the warehouse would be built on speculation and that as of now no tenant has been lined up. He said that two existing driveway entrances off Route 9 would be maintained and a traffic impact study completed in May indicates that the warehouse “is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the adjacent roadways.”

The application for the proposed project was accepted by the Fishkill Planning Board at its June 9 meeting and referred to various boards and commissions including Dutchess County and the New York State Department of Transportation as part of beginning the review.

Brad Vander Vliet of CHI/Acquisitions said that the company is the development arm of Crow Holdings Industrial which is based in Dallas.

“We”™ve been in business since the 1960s and used to be Trammell Crow Companies which was subsequently sold to CBRE in 2006. The family had spun off and retained ownership of Crow Holdings and Trammell Crow Residential. We”™ve built overÂ I believe 60 million square feet of industrial space throughout the country” Vander Vliet said. “We have 12 offices throughout the country. We are well-capitalized. We are probably one of the top-three developers in the country of industrial space. We”™ve got over $5 billion in assets we retain ownership of and we would be retaining ownership of this asset as well if we are successful in our application.”

Trammell Crow Company is an independently operated subsidiary of CBRE. It says it has developed or acquired 2800 buildings valued at nearly $70 billion and consisting of more than 625 million square feet of space. It bills itself as the largest commercial real estate developer in the U.S. with $19.8 billion in active projects in process and an additional $10.1 billion in the pipeline as ofÂ March 31 2022. Crow Holdings Industrial is not owned by CBRE.

Anthony Castillo principal of SESI Consulting Engineers said that a number of underground detention systems and water treatment systems would be used to control stormwater runoff while also noting that the site has previously been built upon.

“The intent is to make sure we do not modify in any way any of the existing drainage patterns” Castillo said. “We have prepared a fully compliant lighting plan and landscape plan that certainly will meet the intent and purpose of the township code.”",,,,,,,,,
CVX,Chevron Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vY2FsaWZvcm5pYWdsb2JlLmNvbS9mbC9jaGV2cm9uLXRvLW1vdmUtaGVhZHF1YXJ0ZXJzLXdpdGhpbi1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLW1vdmUtc29tZS1zdGFmZi10by1ob3VzdG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chevron to Move Headquarters Within California Move Some Staff to Houston – California Globe,"The energy giant Chevron Corporation announced on Friday that they will be moving out of their headquarters to a new place within California while also shifting some employees to Texas sometime next year.

Chevron which is headquartered in San Ramon confirmed that it will stay within the city in it’s new space saying that the real estate market right now is allowing them to adjust employees who work at the headquarters. Unlike previous big company shifts in California such as Tesla and Oracle the company will not be moving it’s headquarters out of state.

“The current real estate market provides the opportunity to right-size our office space to meet the requirements of our headquarters-based employee population” said the company in a statement.

However while the companies headquarters will not be loving out of state a significant numbers of employees will with many employees expected to make the move to the Texas Chevron offices in Houston sometime next year. While the exact number is unknown Chevron will be paying moving costs for employees wanting to move. With Houston offering cheaper housing and lower taxes many are expected to take the move away from the Bay Area.

With Houston being a hub for energy companies Chevron would follow in the footsteps of ExxonMobil who moved their headquarters from Dallas to Houston earlier this year by establishing a larger presence in the city. Chevron itself will be expanding inside the former Enron headquarters building in Houston.

“Like Tech companies going to Austin from the Bay Area energy companies from all over are going to Houston” explained San Francisco-based tech lawyer David Singth to the Globe on Friday. “This won’t be a full move and is likely more in response to more people wanting to work from home more than anything else but it does indeed add to the worrying trend of Californian businesses leaving the state. Leaders here don’t seem to realize just how devastating all these losses can be. It’s tax money from several sources being cut off not to mention prestige job opportunities bringing in the best and brightest to the state and more.

“A lot of people still try and come to California for a decent job a decent living and having a nice starter house but in California and especially the Bay Area that is not the reality at this time. People have been bucking away from working here and this Chevron move is just the latest indication that something is wrong in California.

“The state needs to be more business friendly needs to reduce taxes and bring back affordable homes for people to really reverse this trend but nothing is really happening there. So tech companies continue to leave. Texas and working from home stole San Francisco’s “You have gotta be here to make it big” mentality and now we see it seeping into other industries like energy. And you can bet Chevron won’t be the last one.”

Chevron is expected to finalize the moves sometime next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9leHhvbi1uby1uZXctZ2FzLWNhcnMtYnktMjA0MC13b2xmLWluLXNoZWVwcy1jbG90aGluZy1jbzIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon CEO says no new gas cars globally by 2040 goes wolf in sheep's clothing about CO2,"Every new passenger car sold in the world will be electric by 2040 according to Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods in an interview aired this weekend by CNBC.

The interview also covered the company’s climate ambitions putting a flashy coat of paint on an organization that is the world’s fifth-largest historical polluter and has pushed climate denial at a high level for half a century.

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods sat down with CNBC’s David Faber for a long interview about climate change. The full interview is 35 minutes long (on top of a previous hour-long interview) and mostly discusses climate change and Exxon’s carbon capture and storage desires.

The interview sounds at first glance surprisingly reasonable and candid. Woods does not deny the scientific reality of climate change calls for carbon reductions and a higher global carbon price and recognizes that electric cars are coming.

But in view of Exxon’s history Woods looks more like a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

No new gas cars by 2040

Of particular note is that he seems to think that sales of new gas-powered passenger vehicles will end in 2040 globally – before even many governments do. Some governments have set a target earlier than that – for example 2035 in California and Europe (some European countries will go even earlier); 2030(-ish) in Washington; and the gold standard 2025 in Norway. But there are others that have either set no target or that have set later targets like China’s and Japan’s 2035 targets that still allow gas cars and the US which currently has no target but the earliest nationwide proposal is for 2045.

We’ve written before about how many of these targets will likely be exceeded (and also why post-2035 ambitions are pathetic) but the notion that Exxon also sees these targets being exceeded is quite interesting. Particularly given that not long ago Saudi Aramco the world’s largest oil company said that it expects 90% of vehicles to still be driven by internal combustion engines in “mid-century” and industry analyst IHS Markit thinks only 30% of new cars in “key automotive markets” (i.e. not globally) will be electric in 2040.

So Exxon is a big outlier here and is predicting a much earlier end to gas vehicles than most other groups.

However Woods still claimed this isn’t a threat to Exxon’s business. He said that even if all new cars were electric by 2040 that would only drop oil demand back down to 2013-2014 levels by Exxon’s calculations. Since the company was profitable then he sees a future where it can remain profitable even with that level of demand.

A much larger part of the interview is devoted to Exxon’s plans for carbon capture which it is clear that Woods sees as a potential future revenue stream that Exxon can leverage.

Carbon Capture as another revenue stream

Woods paints a rosy picture of Exxon’s potential for contribution but it’s easy to see the dollar signs in his eyes while he does so.

He claimed that Exxon is responsible for more carbon capture than any other company in the world (by capturing CO2 from its facilities “some” of which it stores and the rest which it uses in operations…to help drill for more oil) and he thinks that Exxon can be a leader in “direct air capture” in the future.

Direct air capture is the idea that carbon can be taken directly out of the air and then sequestered in some way to make sure it stays out of the atmosphere. Environmentalists have questioned whether it is a valuable goal or if it risks delaying climate action or simply works to serve oil industry profits.

Currently it is very costly as Woods pointed out in the interview stating that it is “too expensive” to consider right now. (Would this excuse work if you threw your trash in the street and told your neighbors/city it’s “too expensive” to pay taxes for trash pickup? try it out and report back in the comments.) And the least expensive carbon storage would be to leave that carbon in the ground where it currently is in the first place.

On this tack Exxon has recently asked for a higher carbon price because this would help incentivize companies to develop carbon capture technology which is true – if Exxon or some other company could eventually capture carbon at a cost of $80 a ton and the carbon price is $100 a ton. Then it could profit by removing carbon from the air and this will incentivize cleanup while disincentivizing pollution.

But we’ve heard this carbon pricing story before from Exxon. Last year Exxon lobbyist Keith McCoy was caught on tape by Greenpeace revealing the company’s reason for publicly supporting carbon pricing. The lobbyist said that Exxon felt it was politically safe to advocate for carbon pricing because it makes the company look good (known as “greenwashing“) but that “a carbon tax is not going to happen” so Exxon benefits from goodwill but gets to continue benefiting from massive subsidies.

It is possible that Exxon has now earnestly changed its position only one year later but even if it has it certainly feels like Exxon may have only changed that position because it sees potential for profit. And given Exxon’s history on climate the wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing theory is quite persuasive.

The mess is Exxon’s – why should it profit from cleanup?

In the interview Woods completely failed to take responsibility for Exxon’s tremendous contributions to climate change. When Faber asked whether there is any question that climate change is human-made Woods stated that there’s no question it is and that “it was always understood that CO2 in the atmosphere had potential for warming.”

This statement is true; scientists have known for a long time that CO2 increases warming and that humans are causing this. But Woods blatantly ignored a half-century of Exxon’s efforts to cast doubt on climate science which it is currently being tried in court over and which McCoy admitted to in Greenpeace’s investigation. Exxon knew climate change was happening and lied about it and Woods not only doesn’t acknowledge those lies but claims Exxon never told those lies – which is itself another lie.

And while Exxon plans to lower its carbon emissions and become carbon neutral by 2050 that only accounts for its “scope 1 and 2” carbon emissions. This only counts company-owned facilities and vehicles and the energy they use but it does not account for the impact of various impacts like distribution leased assets employee travel and most importantly Exxon’s products which account for the vast majority of any fossil fuel company’s “scope 3” emissions (for Exxon about 85% of its emissions are scope 3).

Exxon has not committed to carbon neutrality for scope 3 emissions so its “carbon neutral” commitment means it will offset 100%… of 15% of its emissions.

Part of Woods’ plan includes other ways to leverage Exxon’s vast store of hydrocarbons and its existing infrastructure into cleaner-burning fuels. Rather than eliminating petrochemicals from our energy supply which is necessary for the climate Woods wants blue hydrogen (cracked from methane rather than green hydrogen which is generated through electrolysis of water) biofuels and ammonia to play a part in the conversation. He is sure to point out the “challenges” of solar wind and battery storage – three products his company isn’t involved in. And he explained how LNG could fix Europe’s heating issues rather than geothermal heat pumps electric heating or other less-polluting or more efficient solutions. Weird – almost like he’s selling us something.

Despite that Exxon a single company has sold products responsible for almost 3% of all of humanity’s historical carbon emissions Woods claims that Exxon can be a large part of the cleanup which seems appropriate since Exxon made the mess in the first place.

And at the $100/ton price that Exxon seems to favor it would cost several trillion dollars to make up for its historical contribution to carbon emissions and at least $65 billion for its scope 3 emissions for the year 2020. Exxon made $181 billion in revenue and $30 billion in profit in 2020.

But rather than spending the $65 billion a year it needs to clean up its scope 3 CO2 at the price it favors Exxon has announced a plan to spend just $15 billion over 6 years ($2.5 billion per year) on its scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction plan.

The emissions blame game

Woods plays the blame game which is so common with every entity these days with respect to climate change. In this game everyone stands around pointing fingers blaming some other entity for climate change absolving themselves as only responding to market forces and claiming that action can only happen once some other entity takes action first.

Exxon in this case was only responding to “consumer demand” and still responds to consumer demand selling oil because there are buyers for it. Woods foresees continuing to meet that demand and considers Exxon the savior for people around the world who are “living in energy poverty.” But a large majority of currently proven oil reserves must stay in the ground if we want to avoid catastrophe and that catastrophe will disproportionately affect those people living in poverty. He also blames government for not crafting consistent and efficient regulation after Exxon has lobbied against action for decades.

Meanwhile consumers point out Exxon’s contribution to climate change – the 2.6% of scope 3 carbon emissions the company’s products are responsible for – and claim there is a lack of nonpolluting options. Then blame government for not acting to pass climate legislation while also complaining about high prices for a fuel that needs to stay in the ground anyway and basing their votes on whichever candidate “seems more fun to have a beer with” rather than which one will keep our only home from burning.

And governments stand by in a cowardly manner because of fear that voters will blame them for any disruption of the energy industry and that companies will leverage their power toward unseating any representative who affects the profits of established polluting firms (rather than funding them as those firms currently do).

This behavior is echoed on a worldwide level as governments and citizens wonder why they should act when that other country over there “isn’t doing enough” – a common excuse used by the world’s climate criminals.

So everybody points the finger at everybody else and uses this to absolve themselves of blame and to justify inaction.

And the worst part is that everyone is partially right. Nobody is doing enough. Everyone can do more.

But the “wait and see” approach (or worse Exxon’s “propose solutions you think are too unpopular or not technologically or politically viable enough to happen” approach) doesn’t solve any problems. We can’t all stand around pointing fingers and loudly proclaiming our innocence while the boat sinks. We have to grab a pail and start bailing and the more powerful entities like perhaps the 16th largest company by market cap in the world have to leverage that power to bail harder.

Exxon mustn’t wait for the carbon prices to incentivize cleanup – it needs to clean up its mess now and make up for the century of messes it has caused and the lies it continues to tell. Consumers have to stop making excuses for sticking to the status quo and need to demand more action from governments and from themselves because everyone’s life is going to have to change somehow or another to fix the biggest problem humanity has ever faced (and caused). And governments need to take courageous and bold action and call Exxon’s bluff on carbon pricing – which a majority of Americans in every congressional district support.

And if we do all that maybe we’ll even beat Exxon Mobil’s 2040 all-EV target.",,,,,,,,,

The first 50 guests on opening day will receive free Chipotle Goods merch according to a company spokesperson.

Hours will be 10:45 a.m. to 10 p.m. according to the spokesperson.

The restaurant features made-to-order burritos tacos bowls quesadillas salads and more all with a Mexican influence.

The building underwent a remodel and has a totally new exterior look after a nearly $700000 remodel.

The lot housing the building was sold last year to California businessman Jacob Fedder under the Mali Frederica LLC for $1150000.

The facility opened in June 2016 but the Krispy Kreme location permanently closed in February 2018. The .69-acre lot was also formerly home to a KFC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmliZGVtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvaW4tdGhlLXNwb3RsaWdodC1mcmVzaC10d2lzdC1vbi1tYWRlLXRvLW9yZGVyLW1leGljYW4tbWFpbnN0YXlzLWNvbmVtYXVnaC10b3duc2hpcC1tYW4tb3BlbnMvYXJ0aWNsZV8wMjk2ZGU0Ni1lYmY0LTExZWMtYmJkOS01MzY2OWI5N2JmMjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In The Spotlight | 'Fresh' twist on made-to-order Mexican mainstays | Conemaugh Township man opens Tire Hill Taco,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmliZGVtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvaW4tdGhlLXNwb3RsaWdodC1mcmVzaC10d2lzdC1vbi1tYWRlLXRvLW9yZGVyLW1leGljYW4tbWFpbnN0YXlzLWNvbmVtYXVnaC10b3duc2hpcC1tYW4tb3BlbnMvYXJ0aWNsZV8wMjk2ZGU0Ni1lYmY0LTExZWMtYmJkOS01MzY2OWI5N2JmMjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000029D4A3ABF70>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmliZGVtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvaW4tdGhlLXNwb3RsaWdodC1mcmVzaC10d2lzdC1vbi1tYWRlLXRvLW9yZGVyLW1leGljYW4tbWFpbnN0YXlzLWNvbmVtYXVnaC10b3duc2hpcC1tYW4tb3BlbnMvYXJ0aWNsZV8wMjk2ZGU0Ni1lYmY0LTExZWMtYmJkOS01MzY2OWI5N2JmMjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDJkZXRyb2l0LmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1cmdlci1raW5nLWFkZHMtbW9yZS1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWJ1cmdlcnMtdG8tbWVuddIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDJkZXRyb2l0LmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1cmdlci1raW5nLWFkZHMtbW9yZS1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLWJ1cmdlcnMtdG8tbWVudS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burger King to add more 'Impossible' burgers to menu,"article

Burger King rolled out the plant-based Impossible Whopper nationwide in 2019.

Several restaurants have offered plant-based options for customers.

Earlier this year Chipotle Mexican Grill announced that it will add plant-based chorizo to its menu for a limited time at U.S. locations.

In 2019 McDonald’s started selling the PLT or the plant lettuce and tomato burger. McDonald’s said it developed the special recipe using burgers from Beyond Meat a California-based startup that makes ""meat"" from pea protein canola oil beet juice and other ingredients.

Then he saw a problem — 100-old tires dumped in the church’s backyard.

“This is a crime of opportunity. The path of least resistance. It’s open. It’s obscured from the road. Somebody is trying to save a buck but for us I see escalation that could be overwhelming” Crain said.

Crain and his Parishioners have reason to fear escalation. Over the past year vandals have hit the church numerous times. They’ve broken into the building smashed windows sprayed graffiti and dumped used construction material … now this.

“It’s discouraging. It’s frustrating” Crain said.

To add insult to injury the cleanup is not simple and will likely be very expensive. There are laws governing how one can legally dispose of this many old tires.

“One of my members called the Department of Ecology. It’s toxic. It’s a serious problem. It has to be removed by a contractor who is permitted and licensed to do this kind of work” Crain said.

The church has been unable to find a local contractor to properly and legally remove the tires. A contractor in Oregon is making the trip north to bid on the job this week.

Harley said he has no idea how much it will cost his congregation but he fears the church’s ability to serve the community will suffer at least in the short term.

“Every month we do what we call the Mission of the Month to serve the community. Sometimes it’s an international ministry we support. Sometimes it’s local ministries food banks and housing for women and children. Because of this we’re the Mission of the Month” Crain said.

If you would like to help the Saint Barnabas Anglican Church you can call the church directly at 206-365-6565.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

Conclusions

Right now more than 92% of businesses use server virtualization to run their mission-critical systems whether they realize it or not. The market for virtual machines data desktops and servers is growing and if you have skills in virtualization now is a great time to start or shift careers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvZmVhdHVyZS9jYW4tY29tcGFuaWVzLXNhdGlzZnktc2hhcmVob2xkZXJzLWFuZC1zdGFrZWhvbGRlcnMtMjAzMTkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Companies Satisfy Shareholders and Stakeholders?,"What should be the role of corporations in society?

Discussion and debate on this issue have been ongoing for decades. More recently however the 2007-2008 global financial crisis unleashed a huge wave of hostility towards multinational firms and financial institutions and even greater animosity among those on the political Left who do not believe that profit-making should be the sole purpose of the corporation.

The result has been that for nearly two decades whether by choice or necessity (external pressure) companies have jumped on the bandwagon of “corporate social responsibility” activities and implemented environmental social and governance (ESG) measures to demonstrate to investors employees and the public that they contribute to the welfare of society.

But do companies have to choose between the pursuit of growth profitability and return on equity for their shareholders and employing their financial resources for non-business endeavors in pursuit of noble social economic and environmental goals?

Clearly there should be a middle ground. And there is: “shared value.” As conceived by Harvard faculty members Michael Porter and Mark Kramer shared value is a management strategy in which companies find business opportunities in addressing social and environmental problems. An example would be a consumer goods firm that lowers its cost of packaging (saving money) while decreasing its environmental footprint at the same time. For Porter and Kramer shared value is manifested in three ways: reconceiving products and markets redefining productivity and strengthening local clusters.

We propose broadening the “trio” by enlarging it to a “quintet”—adding the indispensable features of ownership and accountability. By upgrading and broadening the concept of shared value we refer to it as the shorthand “Me to We” (M2W).

When it comes to ownership a sense of ownership must permeate the organization and its value chain. This entails a clear definition of responsibility and expectations within a culture of engagement and inclusivity. Firms such as Hilton Cisco and employee-centric enterprises like Patagonia embody this concept.

To illustrate in the automobile industry’s value chain price design quality service and reliability are the critical features in car-purchasing decisions. To be effective and sustainable workers responsible for each feature must feel empowered individually and as a group.

As for accountability it starts with leadership’s example (i.e. Mary Barra at General Motors and Reed Hastings at Netflix). It requires responsibility for individual and team results and an acknowledgment that one’s actions have an effect on others’ ability to accomplish their objectives and goals. At times this means taking responsibility for failure.

Accountability also requires changing the way success is measured at the institutional level shifting from output metrics to outcome metrics. For example generating a smaller carbon footprint due to a specific change in manufacturing operations. Finally accountability cannot be delegated but must be front and center of a culture shift to make it one of the highest priorities of an enterprise.

Recognizably a company is not a social welfare organization; and irrespective of the altruistic missives put out by corporate public relations departments shareholders have a singular goal: ensuring that the company they are invested in relentlessly turns a profit.

While the Business Roundtable’s 2019 “Purpose of a Corporation” statement signed by 200 CEOs emphasizes a commitment to all stakeholders and an economy that serves all Americans the bottom line is … well … the bottom line.

Be that as it may given the growing convergence of shareholder-stakeholder relations in shaping the business ecosystem Me to We (M2W) will gain even more influence and impact. Since the approach is bottom-up as well as top-down—closing the loop—it creates a win-win for all with a clear sense of shared responsibility.

One need only peruse Fortune magazine’s Change the World list that honors companies that use the creative tools of capitalism to address society’s unmet needs. Companies that create value can outperform their peers and produce superior returns both to society and shareholders. MasterCard is a prime example with a focus on growth through financial inclusion yielding greater social value and shareholder returns. Other outstanding firms with a shared value emphasis include Unilever AB InBev and H&M.

We firmly believe that the concept of Me to We could invigorate capitalism and its relationship to society. It could quite possibly drive the next wave of innovation and productivity growth in the global economy as it opens managers’ eyes to immense human needs that must be met large new markets to be served and the internal costs of social deficits—as well as the competitive advantages available from addressing them. Attaining it will require managers to develop new skills and knowledge and governments to learn how to regulate in ways that enable a Me to We approach rather than work against it.

If you're looking for a low-risk approach to 'buy the dip' this big banking bet is worth copying

The Oracle of Omaha has had a busy quarter.

According to his latest 13F filing Warren Buffett has deployed roughly one-third of his cash into new investments during the first three months of the year.

As always Buffett’s biggest swings are noteworthy. However his decision to sell most bank stocks while adding Citigroup (C) to Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK) portfolio is puzzling Wall Street.

Here’s why this contradiction has caught so much attention.

Warren Buffett likes these 2 investment opportunities outside of the stock market

Buffett loves banks

Buffett is deeply familiar with banking and financial services. He believes the business is relatively straightforward and can be extremely lucrative if managed well.

“If you can just stay away from following the fads and really making a lot of bad loans banking has been a remarkably good business in this country” he told Berkshire Hathaway investors in 2003.

What about the 2008 Global Financial Crisis? Buffett went on a shopping spree during that time picking up stakes in JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).

For several years major banks have been the biggest holdings in the Berkshire portfolio. In 2009 he even said Wells Fargo (WFC) was his highest-conviction investment.

“If I had to put all my net worth in one stock that would’ve been the stock” he told Berkshire shareholders.

Catching Buffett on the rebound

This year Buffett has completely exited all these investments. Only a few banks remain in the portfolio.

That doesn’t mean the love affair with financial services is over.

In fact Buffett added a new bank to his collection this year: Citigroup. During the first quarter of 2022 he added 55 million shares of Citigroup to the Berkshire portfolio.

The stake is now worth $2.5 billion making it the 16th largest holding in the basket.

The bet seems to be predicated on a turnaround story.

Citigroup’s transformation

Citigroup has lagged behind its peers. Over the past five years the stock is down over 28%.

Compare that to Bank of America’s 33% return over the same period. Even the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) is up 3%.

The company is now attempting a turnaround to catch up. Last year Citigroup’s board appointed Jane Fraser as the new CEO — making her the first female leader of a major U.S. bank.

Fraser's strategy involves focusing on the more profitable segments of the business. Citigroup is selling or shutting down operations in Mexico Australia Philippines South Korea and elsewhere.

Story continues

Citi stock hasn’t fully reflected this new strategy.

An undervalued opportunity?

Citigroup stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 5.5. Its price-to-book ratio is 0.5. That’s significantly lower than the industry average of 9.5 and 1.1 respectively.

Put simply the stock is cheap.

If the new management team can streamline operations and boost profitability the bank’s valuation could catch up with peers.

Meanwhile a rising interest rate environment should provide another tailwind.

Wade corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees — and in some cases their dependents — seeking abortions in states that outlaw the procedure.

The court's decision to roll back the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling which protected the federal constitutional right to an abortion is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America leaving abortion policy up to individual states and paving the way for numerous states to pass new abortion restrictions. As of Friday afternoon state officials in at least seven states said that new abortion bans can now be enforced.

Millions of people seeking abortions could soon be forced to travel across state lines to access the procedure adding to the cost of an already often expensive healthcare service. For many employers' benefit packages may be the only way they can afford an abortion.

In response corporations some with headquarters or offices in Republican-controlled states are taking action. Companies such as Citigroup Salesforce and Match Group first promised financial support to employees seeking abortions in affected states after a draft version of the opinion leaked in May. Many more followed suit on Friday. Some including Bumble and Lyft also previously said they would donate to organizations that support women's rights such as Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice.

Corporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent and worry about the impact these states' anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.

Here are some of the prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.

Microsoft

Microsoft extended its financial support for ""critical healthcare"" including abortions and gender-affirming care to include coverage for travel expenses for such services after the draft opinion overturning Roe was first leaked.

""We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved"" the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

Yelp

Yelp's existing healthcare plan for US employees pays for women family members and partners to travel out of states with strict abortion laws such as Texas and Oklahoma which ban abortions after 6 weeks.

""This ruling puts women's health in jeopardy denies them their human rights and threatens to dismantle the progress we've made toward gender equality in the workplaces since Roe"" Jeremy Stoppelman co-founder of Yelp said in a statement Friday. ""Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.""

Disney

Disney employees who are unable to access medical care in one location will be given affordable coverage to access the same care in another location according to a company spokesperson. The benefit covers family planning and pregnancy-related decisions.

Match Group

Dating app company Match Group in October established a partnership with Planned Parenthood Los Angeles to provide abortion access for its Texas employees and their dependents. The company is currently considering expanding that benefit to all its US staff including remote employees in states with trigger laws that may soon ban abortions according to a Match spokesperson. Match healthcare plans also help to cover travel and lodging costs for employees who need to travel to receive care the spokesperson said.

Box.com

Box.com will cover employee travel and medical expenses incurred by employees while seeking reproductive services.

Levi Strauss

The company previously said that under its benefits plan employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren't included in the company's benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement it said.

Comcast-NBC Universal

Comcast has an existing healthcare travel benefit for all employees that covers up to $4000 per trip up to three trips per year with a maximum coverage cap of $10000 per year. The amount paid out depends on the type of health care procedure but abortion care is covered according to the company.

Erin Ann Daly won an award of more than $1.4 million from Citigroup Global Markets and other Citi entities for compensatory damages plus interest and attorney fees — along with an expungement of her U5 termination disclosure — after a New York panel ruled on June 24 that the firm had violated the section of the Civil Rights Act prohibiting discrimination in employment. The award also held Citi liable for breaching its own code of conduct and New York state laws against harassment and a hostile work environment as well as a law forbidding retaliation.

“The termination explanation shall be deleted in its entirety and shall be replaced with the following language: ‘In a decision on Ms. Daly’s gender discrimination and defamation claims an arbitration panel has found that she was illegally discharged.’” the award stated. “The panel recommends expungement based on the defamatory nature of the information.”

The striking language taking Citi to task for its treatment of Daly came on the same day as the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade the 1973 case that affirmed women’s rights to abortions. Citi led other megabanks as the first to pledge to pay travel costs for any employee needing to cross state lines for reproductive health care. Its CEO Jane Fraser received American Banker’s Most Powerful Woman in Banking Award last year after becoming the first woman named chief of a major U.S. bank. However the arbitration award offered a reminder of the industry’s legacy as a “boys club” as Daly’s lawsuit put it. To this day fewer than a quarter of planners are women.

The firm still denies Daly’s allegations though. It may seek to vacate the decision in court where she’ll have to seek confirmation of the award and the company will have a small chance of getting a reversal of the decision.

“As we have maintained for the last six years we do not believe Ms. Daly’s claims have any merit” spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos said in a statement. “We disagree with this decision and will explore our options.”

Daly’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision. She hasn’t been registered with any firm since 2014 and first filed a federal lawsuit in 2016 only to have it ordered into FINRA arbitration two years later

She had alleged in her lawsuit that the promising start to her career which included accomplishments like the CEO Award for Excellence in 2012 ran into the proverbial glass ceiling. In June 2012 she found that her entire identification for Citi Private Bank’s stock allocation system had been deleted according to the lawsuit. Citi “deliberately prevented” Daly from getting the functionality back “because she is female” the lawsuit said. When she reported the conduct she learned that she could only keep her job by apologizing according to the lawsuit. She then became a “glorified secretary” the lawsuit stated. She alleged that the firm fired her after she reported a supervisor who “constantly harassed” her for “protected inside information so that he could pass the information along to his favored clients” the suit shows.

“This exclusion from her business functionality resulted in loss of opportunity and is a result of Citi’s ‘boys’ club’ policies and practices which underlie a culture of gender discrimination” according to the lawsuit. “The gender disparity is most clearly evidenced by the deliberate exclusion of females on the desk from allocating stock or even being able to view the full ‘book’ which is the itemized and summarized description of the involved parties their respective interest and finally allocation on each deal. This systematic exclusion of females from any real functionality resulted and continues to result in diminished client contact opportunity for advancement and pigeonholing into service administrative and secretarial roles for females.”

Three years after a federal judge upheld Citi’s motion to compel arbitration and dismiss her whistleblower claim in 2018 Daly filed the arbitration claim against the firm. The original April 2021 claim included allegations of retaliation under the Civil Rights Act violations of Dodd-Frank’s whistleblower protection provisions and “blacklisting” or interference with a prospective employment relationship. The three-member panel dismissed those claims this past April in a partial ruling in favor of Citi’s motion to toss the whole case. In the claim she sought reimbursement for lost earnings double back pay damages for “mental anguish loss of dignity humiliation and injury to livelihood” among other requests.

Citi denied the allegations and asked the panel to order Daly to pay “the reasonable costs and disbursements incurred in defending this proceeding.” In an evidentiary hearing last month it imposed a sanction of $200 against Daly after the arbitrators ruled that she had tried to introduce additional documents “resulting in an unnecessary executive session.”

In nearly every other possible way they unanimously ruled for Daly. The award comes with 3.25% interest and due to the New York State Human Rights Law $42000 in attorney fees. In addition the panel approved the removal of the December 2014 termination explanation filed on Daly’s Form U5. Daly can now get the statements removed from her permanent record after forwarding a copy of the award to FINRA’s Credentialing Registration Education and Disclosure Department for review. The 2016 lawsuit cited the language that she says the firm used to explain her dismissal.

At the time the firm alleged there were “concerns that included tardiness and insubordination in connection with working hours; concerns about a separate incident in which the representative forwarded confidential information about a planned offering to a co-worker without providing notice and receiving appropriate approvals within the firm even though such notice and pre-approval were required by firm policy; and concerns about representative’s responses to certain firm questions.”

The firm’s conduct toward her essentially ended Daly’s career according to the lawsuit.

The study from boutique lending firm Clarify Capital ranked the best U.S. states for women-owned businesses based on metrics like percentage of female-owned small businesses women-to-men pay ratios female unemployment rates number of female-owned companies per 10000 residents in each state and how many women-owned businesses in each state pull in $1 million or more in annual revenue.

Here are the five best states for women-owned businesses according to those rankings:

California Colorado New York Florida Vermont

To an extent California's presence at the top of this list is unsurprising: It's the home of Silicon Valley. California boasts more women-owned businesses with over $1 million in annual revenue than any other state and ranked fifth among all 50 states in terms of its gender pay gap.

That pay gap stat is significant. California has made a strong push in recent years to narrow the state's gender pay gap including signing the Equal Pay Pledge in January which is aimed at improving pay equity among the state's government workforce. Women workers in the state currently earn roughly 88% of the wages of their male counterparts compared to an 81% nationwide figure according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

A recent report from Citigroup found that closing the gender gap could add as much as $2 trillion to the global gross domestic product while creating up to 433 million new jobs.

Clarify Capital also noted that California is one of the country's top states for funding female-founded startups — averaging $10.2 million per deal for female founders in recent years according to numbers from PitchBook. That's second only to Massachusetts' $13 million average and a big deal in its own right: Only about 2.1% of venture capital dollars in the U.S. went to female-founded startups in 2021 according to Pitchbook.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvaGVhbHRoLzIwMjIvSnVuLzI1L2xhdHRvb2xhbmQtdGFzdGUtc2FmZS1tdWx0aS1zZW5zb3JpYWwtcGxheWtpdHMtd2l0aG91dC10b3hpbnMtMjQ2ODk4OS5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9saWZlc3R5bGUvaGVhbHRoLzIwMjIvSnVuLzI1L2xhdHRvb2xhbmQtdGFzdGUtc2FmZS1tdWx0aS1zZW5zb3JpYWwtcGxheWtpdHMtd2l0aG91dC10b3hpbnMtMjQ2ODk4OS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lattooland: ‘Taste-safe’ multi-sensorial play kits without toxins,A business strategy adaptability and innovation are ingrained in her.

Multi-sensorial tool kits as the ‘Lattooland’ name suggests involve a child using multiple senses such as taste touch and smell. When all these senses are in play more neural connections are sparked which boosts the brain’s retention power. “For kids this is even more exponential since 90 per cent of brain development happens at age five.

Israel is actively encouraging its Jewish citizens to settle on both sides of the barrier as it builds and expands settlements deep inside the occupied West Bank more than a decade after the collapse of any serious peace talks.

Palestinians living under decades of military occupation meanwhile clamor for work permits inside Israel where wages are higher. Some 100000 Palestinians legally cross through military checkpoints mainly to work in construction manufacturing and agriculture.

Israel decided to build the barrier in June 2002 at the height of the second intifada or uprising when Palestinians carried out scores of suicide bombings and other attacks that killed Israeli civilians. Authorities said the barrier was designed to prevent attackers from crossing into Israel from the West Bank and was never intended to be a permanent border.

Eighty-five percent of the still-unfinished barrier is inside the West Bank carving off nearly 10% of its territory. The Palestinians view it as an illegal land grab and the International Court of Justice in 2004 said the barrier was “contrary to international law.”

The United Nations estimates that some 150 Palestinian communities have farmland inside the West Bank but west of the barrier. Some 11000 Palestinians live in this so-called Seam Zone requiring Israeli permits just to stay in their homes.

The U.N. also estimates that about 65% of the roughly 710-kilometer (450-mile) structure has been completed.

The security benefits of the barrier have long been subject to debate and while the number of attacks has fallen sharply other factors may be at play.

The intifada began winding down in 2005 after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat died and was replaced by President Mahmoud Abbas who is opposed to armed struggle. Most leading militants were captured or killed and under Abbas the Palestinian Authority cooperates with Israel on security matters. Israeli troops regularly operate in all parts of the West Bank and Israel often announces that it has thwarted attacks before the assailants ever left the territory.

Earlier this year during a renewed wave of violence Israeli media reported that authorities have long ignored gaps in the barrier because they are used by Palestinian laborers. Those are now being closed but the barrier is not expected to be completed anytime soon.

Last week Israel began construction on a new barrier some 45 kilometers (almost 30 miles) long in the northern West Bank to replace a security fence built two decades ago. It says the new barrier will be 9 meters (30 feet) high — more than twice as high as the Berlin Wall.

Concrete walls that high can already be seen snaking through Jerusalem Bethlehem and other urban areas. Near a main Israeli highway the barrier is concealed behind dirt embankments planted with trees and flowers. In other rural areas it consists of barbed wire fences with surveillance cameras and closed military roads.

Israel captured east Jerusalem the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Mideast war territories the Palestinians want for a future state.

In Gaza which has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade since the Hamas militant group seized power from Abbas’ forces in 2007 Israel recently completed a high-tech barrier that runs along the 1967 boundary.

Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by the international community and views the entire city as its capital. But towering concrete walls cut off dense Palestinian neighborhoods that are within the Israeli-drawn municipal boundaries

In the West Bank the Palestinian Authority has limited autonomy in major population centers but Israel retains total control over 60% of the territory. There it has built more than 130 settlements that are home to nearly 500000 Jewish settlers. Many live on the other side of the barrier but have access to a rapidly growing highway system linking the settlements to Israeli cities.

With any peace process effectively frozen the government has instead pursued what it refers to as goodwill gestures — mainly the issuing of more permits so Palestinians can enter through checkpoints and work inside Israel.

As was the case at most of the previous shows on ""The Stadium Tour"" MÖTLEY CRÜE's Tommy Lee sat behind the drums for the first three songs of the band's concert despite sustaining four broken ribs a month ago. Lee played ""Wild Side"" ""Shout At The Devil"" and ""Too Fast For Love"" with his bandmates before being replaced for about half of the set by Tommy Clufetos who plays drums in Ozzy Osbourne's live band and who sat behind the kit for BLACK SABBATH on the legendary heavy metal act's final tour. According to Matt Bailey of The Music Universe Lee returned at several points later in the night to play five more songs including ""The Dirt (Est. 1981)"" ""Dr. Feelgood"" and ""Home Sweet Home"".

The setlist for the Philadelphia concert was as follows:

01. Wild Side (Tommy Lee on drums)

02. Shout At The Devil (Tommy Lee on drums)

03. Too Fast For Love (Tommy Lee on drums)

04. Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away) (Tommy Clufetos on drums)

05. Saints Of Los Angeles (Tommy Clufetos on drums)

06. Live Wire (Tommy Clufetos on drums)

07. Looks That Kill (Tommy Clufetos on drums)

08. The Dirt (Est. 1981) (Tommy Lee on drums)

09. Medley: Rock And Roll Part 2 / Smokin' In The Boys Room / White Punks On Dope / Helter Skelter / Anarchy In The U.K. (Tommy Clufetos on drums)

10. Home Sweet Home (Tommy Lee on piano + drums)

11. Dr. Feelgood (Tommy Lee on drums)

12. Same Ol' Situation (S.O.S.) (Tommy Clufetos on drums)

13. Girls Girls Girls (Tommy Clufetos on drums)

14. Primal Scream (Tommy Lee on drums)

15. Kickstart My Heart (Tommy Lee on drums)

On June 17 MÖTLEY CRÜE bassist Nikki Sixx praised Tommy for ""beasting"" through the first five songs of the band's set in Atlanta a day earlier writing on Twitter: ""The fact that Tommy was told by the doctor to not play with 4 broken ribs & he beasted half our show is a miracle. We are a band and are proud of his strength. He is doing the whole tour and day by day adding more songs. What a fucking animal. Anybody out there ever break ur ribs?""

CRÜE's long-delayed North American trek with DEF LEPPARD POISON and JOAN JETT & THE BLACKHEARTS was originally planned for 2020 and later moved to 2021 and then to 2022. ""The Stadium Tour"" will conclude on September 9 in Las Vegas Nevada.

The next show on the trek is scheduled to take place Tuesday night (June 28) at Bank Of America Stadium in Charlotte North Carolina.

Clufetos is Sixx's bandmate in a project called L.A. RATS. The quartet which also features Rob Zombie and John 5 (ROB ZOMBIE MARILYN MANSON)came together last year expressly to record a cover of ""I've Been Everywhere"" for the soundtrack to the movie ""The Ice Road"".

""The Stadium Tour"" marks the CRÜE's first live dates since wrapping its 2014/2015 farewell tour. CRÜE toured with POISON back in 2011 and DEF LEPPARD teamed up with POISON for a string of road dates in 2017 but this jaunt marks the first time all four acts have hit the road together for an extended tour.

CRÜE fans who shelled out for the band's 2014/2015 ""farewell"" tour were led to believe that the group would never return after playing its final show on December 2015 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The band touted the signing of a pre-tour ""cessation of touring"" agreement as cementing the fact it truly was the end of CRÜE's life on the road.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzI1LzMtaGlnaC15aWVsZC1kaXZpZGVuZC1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1jYW4tdHVybi0xMjAwMC1pL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Can Turn $12000 Into More Than $16000 by 2023,"Investors can increase their returns by looking for discounted stocks that generate lots of passive income.

A great strategy for investors looking to buy stocks right now is to look for stocks trading at a discount and also for stocks that pay a nice dividend. When stocks sell off as they have been their annual dividends tend to go up because while their dividends stay the same their stock prices are lower. This gives investors a great opportunity to invest in stocks that pay out passive income and they can make money from price appreciation as well.

Investing in these three stocks below could turn $12000 into more than $16000 in roughly one year's time representing a 33% plus return on your initial investment.

1. AT&T

The largest mobile service provider in the world AT&T (T 0.18%) has had a strong year with shares up roughly 4% in 2022. It may not sound like much but with the S&P 500 down roughly 21.5% this year AT&T is widely outperforming.

It's not too surprising to see investors turn to the telecommunications sector as inflation heats up because communication through mobile phones and devices is critical to our society and is not going anywhere anytime soon. In fact as the world becomes more remote and digital companies like AT&T will become more critical not that the space isn't competitive.

AT&T recently spun off its media division Warner Bros. Discovery in order to focus more closely on its core telecommunications business including 5G and fiberoptic broadband. As part of the spin-off AT&T chopped its dividend roughly in half from $2.11 to $1.08. Investors weren't thrilled but the annual yield at AT&T's current share price is still a very healthy 5.4%.

2. Life Storage

As a real estate investment trust (REIT) Life Storage (LSI) must pay out 90% of its taxable income in annual dividends in order to maintain its special tax advantages. This is why you will see many REITs with strong dividends. Life Storage operates more than 1100 self-storage facilities in 36 states.

Self-storage is a good business these days and is seen as a recession-proof business because of how big e-commerce has become for the economy which relies on storage space. Over the years Life Storage has also done an excellent job of growing its adjusted funds from operations per share with a nearly 10% compound annual growth rate between 2010 and 2021.

Although shares are down roughly 27.5% this year Life Storage's stock is still up more than 108% over the last five years. The company continues to pay out a competitive annual dividend yield of roughly 3.4%.

3. Citizens Financial Group

The large regional bank Citizens Financial Group (CFG 1.07%) spun off from the Royal Bank of Scotland now NatWest Group in 2014. Management has put in a lot of work to improve the bank's core operations and is now starting to see success.

Not only has Citizens vastly improved its deposit base but it's also built out a much stronger and more diverse operation from a revenue perspective that includes a strong commercial lending operation wealth management mortgage and investment banking capabilities.

Additionally Citizens has formed a national consumer digital bank that includes a wide array of consumer lending products. The bank's 4.3% annual dividend yield also remains very strong.

The strategy

So how can you turn a $12000 investment into more than $16000 in just around one year's time?

Invest $4000 in each stock. In one year a $4000 investment in AT&T would reap $216 in passive income. The Wall Street Journal has an average 12-month price target of $22.50 which implies about a 12.5% upside from AT&T's roughly $20 share price which would be another $500. That's a total of $716 from AT&T in one year.

With a dividend yield of roughly 3.4% a $4000 investment in Life Storage would result in $136 of annual passive income. Analysts have an average 12-month price target of roughly $143. That implies an almost 35% upside from Life Storage's current share price which means $1400 in profit if the stock reaches this price target. That's another $1536 from Life Storage.

Finally Citizens would pay out $172 in passive income on a $4000 investment with its 4.3% yield. The Street has a roughly $51 average 12-month price target on Citizens implying about 42% upside on the stock from current levels. That means a $4000 investment would result in $1680 if the price target is achieved and roughly $1850 combined with the passive income.

Add all three together and that's a roughly $4100 return on your $12000 investment which would effectively turn your $12000 investment into more than $16000 in one year's time. Analyst price targets are subject to change and are very rarely dead-on but after such a big sell-off this year there could certainly be a market bottom and sustained bounce sometime over the next year."

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi flies to the German Alpine resort of Schloss Elmau as a special invitee to the G-7 Summit meeting from June 26 to 27 along with other leaders of the global South such as Argentina Indonesia Senegal and South Africa he will be aware of the opportunities for forging closer partnerships to gain investment technologies and additional climate financing.India will bring a fresh perspective on the narrative of the global north on climate change carbon pricing pandemic prevention issues related to Intellectual Property  global food security and public stock holdings. As an active participant in many other divergent plurilateral groupings like the Quad I2U2 and BRICS the Summit will further establish the indispensability of India in any noticeable North South or North-South platforms when it comes to searching for solutions and their implementation.The priorities for the German G-7 Presidency are acceleration of global energy transition economic stability and transformation pandemic prevention and control sustainable investments and infrastructure and promotion of shared values of democracy and rule of law.G-7 members comprising Canada France Germany Italy Japan UK and the US currently represent close to 45% of the global GDP and more than 10% of the world's population.

For its Presidency Germany has adopted the motto of 'Progress towards an equitable world'. Germany would like to send a strong signal in support of international responsibility steps that G-7 can take to strengthen multilateral cooperation and to develop specific responses to global challenges along with the five partner countries and nine invited international organisations -- ILO IEA IMF OECD  WB WHO WTO and UN besides the EU.The G-7 has taken some important decisions with regard to global food security supply chain resilience digital and net zero transitions which will require substantial investments but also widespread support from countries like India which not only has an interest but will also be an indispensable partner in the implementation of these initiatives. The main document expected to be endorsed during the summit by the G-7 and the partner countries is on ""resilient democracies"". There will be an inevitable overhang of the Russia-Ukraine issue even as the G-7 and partner countries and organisations try to move forward on some challenging issues facing the world today.Germany and the US are leading the G-7 proposal for consultations on Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) with India Argentina Vietnam Senegal and Indonesia on the lines of a partnership established with South Africa in 2021 which was focused on climate finance. India would like a tailor-made JETP to be more focused on technology aspects -- technology transfer and finance information exchange as well as relevant investments covering proposals for 'Make in India'.Some of these proposals could include re-skilling and training of mine workers; establishment of a green hydrogen hub in India; green energy corridors; sustainable and affordable bio-fuels; Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) and sequestration; offshore wind energy generation; energy storage; creating low carbon steel cement and concrete; flexibilisation of thermal power plants; advanced solar thermal technologies; energy efficiency technologies in the entire value chain; and electric vehicles and transportation.Discussions at the G-7 Summit will focus on climate energy and health as well as on advancing food security and gender equality with particular focus on Global Alliance for Food Security put forward by Germany. Prime Minister Modi will speak at both these sessions and is expected to highlight the contribution of India and its position as a major democracy and food supplier and a responsible member of the international community with remarkable climate action and transition plans towards net zero.India needs to highlight a technology-focused India-specific Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) and a development partnership with the G-7 in supply chain resilience and diversification education and skill development emerging technologies and digital transformation.

South Africa’s Competition Appeal Court said Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) breached conditions linked to transactions in 2016 and 2017.

Six years ago competition officials in South Africa approved a deal between SABMiller The Coca-Cola Co. and Gutsche Family Investment that created Africa’s largest bottler.

Both deals included deals to protect workers. In a judgment handed down on 17 June the Competition Appeal Court ruled CCBA violated those conditions with its local subsidiary retrenched 368 employees in 2019.

The court’s ruling went against a decision by South Africa’s Competition Tribunal last September. The Tribunal set aside a notice from The Competition Commission South Africa which had pressed the case CCBA had breached the conditions.

Sunita Tulsiani 65 told ThePrint “We had to switch to Pepsi in the absence of Thums Up. I remember how my then 14-year-old son used to crave Thums Up. But we didn’t know where to get it from.”

New Delhi: Sometime in the summer of 1994 lovers of Thums Up the popular cola brand in India were in for a rude surprise. Their favourite drink had inconspicuously disappeared from the stores near them.

Thums Up was launched in the Indian market in 1977 under Ramesh Chauhan’s Parle group. In 1993 the brand was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company.

For a long time it was believed that this was just a way for The Coca-Cola Company to ‘kill’ Thums Up and diminish any competition that Coke faced.

While Coca-Cola has repeatedly denied this allegation marketing gurus of the time believed that the company was indeed up to something suspicious. The successful removal of other carbonated drinks such as Goldspot and Citra (both initially owned by the Parle group) from the market had not helped the company’s case.

Lloyd Mathias business strategist and former executive vice president at PepsiCo India gave an explanation for this. “The feeling among people was that being an international company Coca-Cola’s focus would be more on its global brands like Fanta Sprite and of course Coke and other drinks in the Indian market will phase out gradually” he told ThePrint.

But Indians didn’t let go of their favourite Thums Up which continues to be the leader in the country even today with 42% market share. Such has been the romance with Thums Up that a hill in Maharashtra has been named after the drink.

‘Attempted murder’ of Thums Up

The Coca-Cola Company had left India in 1977 when the then Indian government asked it to not just transfer 60 per cent of the shares of its Indian firm — according to what was then the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act — but also reveal the formula for its secret recipe to Indian shareholders. The company only returned to India post liberalisation in 1993.

At this point in time Thums Up was the leading product in Indian markets. Chauhan of Parle group was the mastermind behind Thums Up’s formulation and he had very strategically placed the drink in markets to fill the void left by Coke and other colas exiting India.

One of the strongest points of this homegrown drink was also its tagline ‘Taste the Thunder’ and its appeal of being an Indian cola brand.

“Taste the Thunder is India’s longest running national campaign even today” said Ashok Kurien whose agency Ambience Advertising had come up with the text.

When Coca-Cola re-entered the Indian market one of the ways in which it tried to displace Thums Up with Coke was by ‘poaching the franchise bottlers’ of Parle that owned Thums Up. Parle had been working on an agreement basis with bottle manufacturers across the country.

When Coca-Cola went around buying those units Parle did not have bottles to actually pack its drink in and sell. Chauhan finally sold off the beverage arm of Parle to Coca-Cola for $40 million.

After Coca-Cola acquired Thums Up the drink nearly stopped being available in the market. It was also not being advertised or marketed anywhere. But Coca-Cola’s strategy backfired since people started buying Pepsi instead of Coke. The company realised that by ‘killing’ Thums Up it had served the market share to Pepsi.

“Let rumour be rumour. No truth that we tried to kill Thums Up or any other drink” Deepak Jolly a Coca-Cola communication executive told ThePrint.

Coca-Cola had about 60.5 per cent share of the Indian soft-drink market in the 1990s but soon understood that if it removed Thums Up it would be left with merely 28.7 per cent of the market share. Hence Thums Up was re-launched in 1997.

“Initially Coca-Cola’s focus was on their mainstream brands but soon after a few years they realised that there was a lot of equity with Thums Up Limca and other Indian brands. And they decided to stabilise the production of these to go after their major competition Pepsi” Matthias added.

The other Indian beverages acquired by Coca-Cola however did not survive the onslaught. Citra and Goldspot were relinquished from the market by the 2000s as they were competing with the likes of Fanta and Sprite the global brands owned and prioritised by Coca-Cola. However Limca was retained after Coca-Cola realised that the demand for it was high in the early 2000s. In 2012 Coca-Cola had also brought back Citra for rural areas.

Appeal of Thums Up

One of the reasons why Thums Up was an instant hit is because it gave more quantity for less price.

Vijay Sharma director at Employees’ State Insurance Corporation recalled “Thums Up was the first drink to launch large-size bottles (300 ml as against 250 ml prevalent at that time) called ‘maha cola’ which added to its appeal as a thirst quenching summer beverage. I also remember cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and Imran Khan advertising together for Thums Up in sports magazines two sportsmen of different nations promoting the same product a rare scene in today’s time.”

Drinking Thums Up was also seen as an assertion of masculinity strength and the fact that anyone drinking it was a grown-up and to be taken seriously. Advertisements for Thums Up featured actors like Akshay Kumar Salman Khan and Mahesh Babu as its brand ambassadors. They were shown to prefer the beverage over any other for its “new code of masculinity”.

One of other reasons why Thums Up sustained in the Indian market was also the rise in demand for homegrown products post-liberalisation.

Anupam Roongta a Jaipur-based investor and trainer said “I believe lots of factors were at play together in making Thums Up what it is — ambassadors easy availability and most importantly taste. Once people get used to a certain taste it’s not easy to overpower that with any other product. Maggi is another such example. No matter how many other products came be it healthy or of any other taste since the customers are used to the taste of Maggi it is just unstoppable.”

NBA player Pascal Siakam is using the off-season to drive impact in the city of Toronto. According to Complex the Cameroon-bred Raptors star recently donated free laptops to youth in underserved communities.

Toronto’s digital divide has had a disproportionate impact on residents in low-income neighborhoods. Studies show that 34 percent of Toronto households are anxious about the cost of their home internet bills with higher rates of concern amongst those living in poverty and communities of color. Further research revealed of the two percent of Toronto households without internet half of them cite affordability issues and households earning less than $50000 have less than one computer for each person.

Cognizant of how technology has the power to enhance education Siakam wanted to ensure youngsters are equipped with the tools needed to thrive. He stopped by Regent Park’s Bill Graham Youth Centre to distribute laptops to over 150 middle school girls in an effort to empower them to chart paths in tech and change the narrative surrounding gender diversity in the space.

He hosted the giveaway through his philanthropic imprint Coding for Champions in collaboration with Penny Appeal Canada and the PS43 Foundation. His program has collectively contributed $406000 towards eradicating the digital divide and advancing tech education.

Several NBA players have spearheaded social good efforts centered on ensuring youth have access to tech resources. Bradley Beal gifted computers to students at a Washington D.C.-based high school and Russell Westbrook donated 650 computers to underprivileged students in Houston so they could continue learning amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“I’m always wanting to do something [positive] and I know that I’ve been blessed with a lot of opportunities being in the position that I am” he shared in a statement according to the news outlet. “Knowing that technology is taking over we just want to make sure that we give kids especially young girls today an advantage. It’s something that I’m really deeply passionate about. I would do anything to be here.”

The program initiated by Colgate-Palmolive Philippines and Green Antz Builders includes agreements with the governments of Manila Quezon City and Taguig in collaboration with Department of Education (DepEd) units and City Environment and Natural Resources Offices a news release said.

The program also encompasses drop-off points for plastic waste in various Ayala Malls in Metro Manila.

Colgate-Palmolive PH and Green Antz celebrated the first year of a closed loop plastic waste management initiative in Bulacan that diverted from the environment hundreds of tons of plastic waste in cooperation with five local government units (LGUs) and 112 public schools under the auspices of the DepEd.

The LGUs are those of Baliuag Malolos City Plaridel Pulilan and San Ildefonso.

The plastic waste is collected by the LGUs communities and schools and sent to Green Antz to make into eco-bricks.

They are then used in the building of “Wash and Brush Stations” which are turned over to the LGUs. Some 20 handwashing stations have been constructed during the period.

An innovative and visionary social enterprise Green Antz offers building and housing solutions that integrate eco-friendly practices and green technologies in its products and services.

The company helps create livelihood opportunities as it produces eco-bricks eco-pavers and other materials composed in part of plastic waste. Its tagline is “Creating Sustainability. Challenging Poverty. Now.”

The Bulacan initiative covers more than 2000 teachers and almost 70000 students who besides collecting plastic waste learn proper solid waste management habits at an early age.

The initiative is changing residents’ mindsets on plastic waste inspiring new behavior and understanding about environmental responsibility. Plastic waste is exchanged for bond paper printers segregation bins clock towers thermal scanners or alcohol dispensers for schools.

Incentives for Municipal Environment and Natural Resources Offices and collectors include rice and grocery packages.

Marking their first-year milestone in Bulacan Colgate-Palmolive PH and Green Antz renewed their partnership agreement as well as a memorandum of understanding with the Municipality of Plaridel.

A new “Wash and Brush Station” at the Plaridel Municipal Hall was turned over to Mayor Tessie Vistan by Colgate-Palmolive PH President and General Manager Arvind Sachdev and Green Antz President and CEO Rommel Benig.

“I am always on the lookout for trusted allies in delivering essential services to our constituents. The LGU needs partners especially in our goal to safeguard the environment. We are very pleased that we can count on Colgate-Palmolive Philippines and Green Antz Builders both committed like us to provide for a more sustainable future” Vistan remarked.

Sachdev said: “Plastic waste is one of our most serious environmental problems globally and locally. At Colgate-Palmolive PH we have the responsibility to be part of the solution and take a leadership role to confront the plastic waste challenge.“

“We are allocating resources to divert plastic waste away from landfills and the ocean to help collect recover and recycle the equivalent amount of plastic we generate in the market and achieve our vision of achieving plastic neutrality” Sachdev added.

“We are not just collecting plastic waste” he said. “We are also providing Filipinos with more sustainable products like the eco-friendly Colgate Bamboo toothbrush with biodegradable and compostable handles. Our Palmolive Shampoo and Palmolive Soap sachets are now in mono-material recycle-ready packaging. Our Colgate Naturals Toothpaste is in recyclable tubes.”

He said that Colgate-Palmolive is “making sure that our packaging systems in the future will use less plastic. This way we are increasing the acceptability of Colgate-Palmolive products’ packaging in the recycling stream.”

Sachdev said that renewing partnerships “is our way of continuing our commitment to preserve the environment and to make the planet a better place.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sports Business Journal reported Friday that Amazon and Comcast both were in negotiations up against the Disney-owned ESPN.

According to the report the new deal is said to be worth between $75-million and $90-million. The previous deal between the two entities was for three-years and $15-million.

There are 20 F1 drivers on 10 different teams that are competing in 22 races in 2022. The United States plays host to two races the Miami Grand Prix and Circuit of the Americas in Austin Texas. A third U.S. race contested on a course that includes the famed Las Vegas Strip will debut in 2023.

The report adds that “ESPN’s deal gives the media company flexibility to put a small but undetermined number of races exclusively on its ESPN+ streaming service. Most races will be carried on linear television either ABC or ESPN.”

As for the bid “Amazon reportedly put in a higher bid – said to be around $100-million per year – with the right to sublicense to a linear broadcast network.”

Comcast’s offer also failed despite that through its Sky subsidiary Comcast is a big F1 partner outside of the U.S. Netflix had discussions with F1 and actually made an offer but its bid wasn’t close on money. F1 executives made it clear that they were not ready to put all of its races on a streaming service yet the SBJ report adds.

In a separate report SeekingAlpha summed up the new F1 television deal for the USA:

Formula One Racing (NASDAQ:FWONA) has agreed to renew its broadcast rights deal with ESPN (NYSE:DIS) through 2025 Sports Business Journal reports.

That contract’s not signed yet according to the report but rival bidders Amazon.com (AMZN) and Comcast (CMCSA) have been informed that their bids won’t be accepted.

And the three-year deal reportedly comes at $75-$90-million per year – a sharp increase from the $5-million per year ESPN had in a three-year $15-million deal from 2019 (but apparently below an Amazon.com bid of around $100M per year and a similar bid from Comcast). Netflix (NFLX) which has seen racing success with its Drive to Survive docuseries put in a bit that wasn’t close on the money SBJ said.

That may have come down to streaming rights requested. For Disney’s (DIS) part while most races will be carried on its ABC or ESPN linear channels ESPN has the flexibility to put a small number on its ESPN+ streaming service according to SBJ.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIyLTA2LTI2L25ldy1vbi1uZXRmbGl4LWFuLWFkdmVydGlzaW5nLXN1cHBvcnRlZC10aWVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New on Netflix: An Advertising-Supported Tier,"Why did this happen?

Wade in a ruling that the rightwing has been planning for decades. The constitutional right of a woman to have an abortion was eviscerated after almost 50 years a decision that will impact mostly poor women in red states. The New York Times reports that 13 states have trigger laws that allow the abortion ban to go into effect. Arkansas Kentucky Louisiana Missouri Oklahoma South Dakota and Utah will enforce the abortion ban immediately. Within weeks Idaho Mississippi North Dakota Tennessee Texas and Wyoming will follow suit.

Among the companies that have stepped up to pay for their employees to travel for abortion care are the Walt Disney Company Netflix Sony Pictures Comcast and Paramount Pictures.

While there has been much chatter lately about Hollywood glorifying gun violence the depiction of abortion in movies and television has been more nuanced. Here are some prominent movies and television shows with abortion storylines.

FILM

Dirty Dancing (1987)

Set 10 years before the passage of Roe v. Wade in the summer of 1963 Baby (Jennifer Grey) tries to help a dancer in a Catskills resort get an abortion by asking her doctor father for money. When the procedure is botched by a butcher doing the illegal procedure she asks for her father’s help to save the woman. The abortion isn’t shown onscreen and neither is the word ‘abortion’ used. The film was directed by Emile Ardolino and won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song “(I’ve Had) The Time of my Life” and was the first to sell a million copies of home video.

Grandma (2015)

Lily Tomlin plays Elle a lesbian poet mourning the death of her partner when her 18-year-old granddaughter Sage comes to visit asking for money for an abortion. Elle has none and Sage’s credit card has been taken away so the two drive across Los Angeles looking for ways to raise $640 extorting the baby’s father calling in Elle’s old debts and even asking Elle’s ex-husband for a loan.

In New York she finds out that she was misled by the local crisis pregnancy center and that she is actually further along in her pregnancy requiring a two-day procedure at a secondary clinic. The movie focuses more on the challenges that the girls have to face in order to get the money for the procedure than the actual abortion itself.

The film won the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize at the 70th Berlin Film Festival.

TELEVISION

Grey’s Anatomy (Season 8 2011)

Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) tells her husband Owen (Kevin McKidd) at the end of Season 7 that she wants an abortion when she discovers she’s pregnant. As an ambitious career woman and dedicated surgeon her job means more to her than anything and she never wanted children. She cancels a number of appointments at the clinic until Owen gets on board with her decision. It’s worth noting that the character got pregnant in Season 1 but she has an ectopic pregnancy rupture that makes redundant the abortion appointment she had previously made.

It is rare to see a show in which a woman declares that she does not want to be a mother.

Shrill (Season 1 Episode 1 Hulu 2019)

In the first episode of the first season Annie (Aidy Bryant) finds out that the morning-after pill does not work for overweight women and that she needs an abortion. Seeing her pregnancy as a wake-up call to take charge of her life she goes through with the abortion getting empowered to break up with the jerk boyfriend and standing up to her rude boss and condescending mother.

The Bold Type (Season 3 Episode 4 2019 Freeform)

A gay bi-racial woman running for the office of Councilwoman discloses the abortion she had at age 20 in college in part because she wants to correct misinformation about the procedure. In the process Kat (Aisha Dee) also discloses that she smokes weed and protests for immigrants’ rights. Her campaign manager also confides that she had an abortion as well. This is a relatively rare portrayal of two queer Black women discussing the subject onscreen.

Dear White People (Volume 2 Chapter 4 Netflix)

In this show about Black students at a white Ivy League college the character seeking an abortion is shown researching the process and the attendant challenges of getting one. Coco (Antoinette Robertson) a hardworking young woman and the first in her family to attend college takes her time making her decision and the show plays out a scenario where she drops out of college and keeps her baby. But she forces herself to face the challenges and hardship of being a single mother and decides that she needs to go through the procedure to fulfill her dreams of a good life.

Jane the Virgin (Season 3 Episodes 1-2 Netflix)

The first two episodes of this season deal with Jane’s mother Xiomara’s abortion. In a flashback in the first one she discovers she’s pregnant and worries about telling her mother. In the second one she’s already had the abortion.

Xiomara (Andrea Navedo) got pregnant with Jane as a teenager and had the baby because she was pressured to do so by her mother. 20 years later she gets pregnant again from a one-night stand and has no qualms about terminating the pregnancy. The procedure is not shown on television. Her thinking about going through with it is clear; she chooses not to be a mother again despite potentially alienating her mother and family. The episode focuses on the family’s reaction not her decision.

13 Reasons Why (Season 3 Episode 2 Netflix)

Chloe (Anne Winters) goes to a crisis pregnancy center to get funding help when she gets pregnant but the place is actually an anti-abortion center that tries to talk her out of getting the procedure by manipulating her psychologically. When she does go to a clinic to get the abortion she is terrorized by anti-abortion activists as she tries to enter the facility and one throws a fake fetus covered in blood at her.

She goes through the abortion without any support from family or friends alone through the ordeal. The episode makes clear the hurdles that young women face when they try to protect their futures this way.

Scandal (Season 5 Episode 9 ABC 2015)

Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) finds she’s pregnant with the President’s baby in this episode as a parallel storyline to a fight in the Senate to save Planned Parenthood’s funding. She takes matters into her own hands and goes to an abortion clinic as she has no intention of being a mother or a First Lady finding life in the White House extraordinarily limiting and proscribed. The scene is handled matter-of-factly. Olivia doesn’t agonize over her decision she gets through it and goes home.

GLOW (Season 1 Episode 8 Netflix)

In the show set in the 1980s when Ruth (Alison Brie) discovers that she’s pregnant after having an affair with her best friend’s husband her only option is an abortion. Wrestling coach Sam (Marc Marron) drives her to Planned Parenthood and asks her if she’s making the right decision. “It’s not the right time” she answers. “Not the right baby.”

She goes through the procedure eyes fixed on the ceiling completely clear about her choice. The subject is never raised again in the show.

Euphoria (Season 1 Episode 7 HBO)

Cassie (Sydney Sweeney) is a promiscuous teenager with a troubled home life. Her parents have split up and her father is a drunk. She looks for love in all the wrong ways hooking with boys who use her and leave her. Nude photos and sex tapes of her end up online.

Since falling into it he’s run his one-person business Going Going Gone from his home in Corte Madera for 17 years. With no advertising or website just word-of-mouth trade shows and relationships he’s built with manufacturers and retailers over the the past decade he acts as a middle man — selling manufacturers’ excess inventory to retailers as well as helping to arrange production of the products if they sell well.

Q What drew you to the business world?

A My father owned a grocery store in New York for 54 years and I always tried to follow in his footsteps. He was a very good businessman. In college I graduated in marketing and when I went to apply for a job they said “You need a year of sales experience.” So I took a job just for the experience and found that’s what I love doing meeting new people and the immediate satisfaction. In the beginning it got me out of my comfort zone and it helped me in both my personal and professional life.

Q What’s some good advice you took from your father?

A Treat people how you want to be treated. Don’t look for the home run on every sale. If you treat people right they are going to come back to you again and again. Relationships are more important.

Q Tell me about your business’ beginnings.

A I was commuting to San Diego from San Francisco running the sales for a candle and home décor company. I already knew how to do excess inventory because of my previous few jobs. The commute got old after two years and I went to my wife and said “I am going to start this company at least until my next vice president of sales position.” My third day doing this I got a booth in a show in Las Vegas. I didn’t even have a sign. I talked to a company in home décor that I had a relationship with and I said “Do you have any excess inventory? I want to try to sell it at the show.” They said they had 6000 leather waste baskets and I asked for them to send a sample to the show and they did. I got some samples for skin care products from another company I knew. The first day I sold all 6000 leather waste baskets then somebody who had a few booths from me was watching the action and calls me up the Monday after the show and he said “How much would you sell the rest of your inventory for?” I got $200000 and I go I think has legs. The retailers manufacturers and consumers all benefit and the product doesn’t end up in a landfill so the Earth benefits too. That’s important.

Q When did you find out about excess inventory?

A I never knew about excess inventory until I was in the computer software business and T.J. Maxx called me up and said “I would like to sit down with you and carry some computer software.” I met with them in my office showed them a lot of product came up with the offer and I sold them $2 million worth of software in the 1990s. That’s how I got into it.

Q What unique products have you moved?

A Hair care is my big business. Last year I sold about 2 million pieces of hair care and I’ve sold 1 million of nail polish in a year and another year it was 1 million eye lashes. I have sold eight truck loads of Cadbury chocolate fondue in Canada and three container loads of hair extensions. You never know what you are walking into until you get into it a different issue and a different reason why they want to move it.

Q Is there a thrill that comes along with this job?

A Exactly. At this point I do it more for that. It’s the fun of closing a deal and making it work. It’s a puzzle that you have to make the pieces fit."

El entrenador Diego Cocca sigue al mando del proyecto con la base principal de su plantel pero sumó a un nuevo jugador para el ataque: el peruano Edison Flores llegó desde el DC United de la MLS.

El fichaje de ‘Oreja’ genera gran expectativa entre los hinchas y el propio futbolista no ocultó su emoción en el nuevo reto que asume. “La verdad es que estoy muy contento y muy feliz de poder llegar aquí al bicampeón. Es un club que está haciendo muy bien las cosas en los últimos años” confesó el deportista en entrevista para el área de prensa de los ‘Rojinegros’.

“Vengo a un gran equipo. Conozco a algunos compañeros y me he enfrentado a otros también. Estoy contento por haber tomado esta decisión y poder trabajar en Atlas. Quería regresar (a Liga MX) con un cuadro importante y se pudo dar. Cuando llegó esta opción no la pensé mucho. Deseaba que las cosas se den y estamos muy contentos” agregó el volante.

De la misma forma Edison Flores apuntó que buscará alcanzar la gloria con los ‘Zorros’ tanto a nivel local como internacional. “Venimos a trabajar junto a mis compañeros por un objetivo mucho más grande ahora que es seguir por la senda de los buenos resultados y lograr cosas importantes. Dentro de ello están la liga mexicana y la Concachampions que da un plus más grande tanto al jugador como al club” resaltó el peruano.

“Se habla mucho en Washington D. C. sobre el fútbol de México. De Atlas se comenta más en los últimos años porque viene haciendo las cosas bien y porque obviamente va a ser un rival a seguir en la Concachampions” manifestó el exjugador del DC United.

Finalmente Edison Flores destacó el apoyo de los fanáticos del Atlas. “La hinchada es grande siempre está presionando y alentando. La presión de los aficionados es muy buena además del apoyo que le dan a mis compañeros. Son un soporte y espero celebrar muchas cosas junto a ellos” concluyó ‘Oreja’.

“Muy contento muy feliz de poder llegar al Bicampeón”

En la ceremonia la actriz de 46 años vistió un imponente vestido de novia blanco escotado con un ligero encaje en la parte delantera y una amplia gasa en la zona de las mangas.

Fue así como Klauss completó su tercera ceremonia de la mano de Gómez pues tiempo atrás se habían unido con una Mamo Wiwa pueblo indígena de Colombia y la segunda con un sacerdote cercano.

De hecho la presencia del recordado “Abuelo Martín” en la primera temporada de “Pasión de Gavilanes” ya había sido adelantada por la propia Natasha quien le agradeció al actor quien además es padrino de sus hijos.

“Solo te puedo decir gracias por ser estar y amarme como yo a ti. Caminar de la mano contigo es estar con papá y mamá que están en el cielo acompañándome. Tu bendición es la de ellos”.

LOS ACTORES DE PASIÓN DE GAVILANES EN LA BODA DE NATASHA KLAUSS

En sus redes sociales la celebs de Colombia mostró varios detalles de su boda celebrada el pasado 17 de junio en la que incluyó videos de los asistentes la decoración y la recepción de la ceremonia.

En las stories de Instagram la actriz mostró además a quien fue el encargado de llevarla al altar: el actor cubano y excompañero de elenco Jorge Cao.

Sin embargo quienes no se pudieron observar en el evento fueron sus compañeros de elenco de “Pasión de Gavilanes” por lo que muchos fanáticos le preguntaron a la colombiana por qué se ausentaron.

En una dinámica de preguntas y respuestas Klauss preguntó a sus 17 millones de seguidores “¿A cuáles de mis invitados les gustaría ver?” a lo que un usuario respondió “Danna García”.

Fue allí que “Sarita Elizondo” aprovechó para explicar lo ocurrido. “Tenía que dar esta respuesta en vivo porque la verdad por Michel por el Gato. No es ‘Pasión de Gavilanes’ es mi boda. Es la boda de Natasha con Daniel. Entonces por favor entiéndanlo ¿vale?” comentó en una transmisión.

Las preguntas no quedaron allí pues otros seguidores le recordó la ausencia de sus compañeros y respondió en la dinámica por Michel Brown su pareja en la ficción de Telemundo y Caracol.

“Igual que les respondí por lo de Danna el Gato y todo eso. De una vez aprovecho es la boda de Natasha no es ‘Pasión de Gavilanes’. Y bueno algunos no pudieron asistir si estuvieron invitados pero no pudieron asistir” señaló.

NASA/ESA/Hubble

To the unaware VY Canis Majoris is a red hypergiant that can stretch almost 10000 times the distance between our planet and the sun in diameter. However not much is known about the death of such red hypergiants.



Scientists believe that instead of blowing up into a big red sphere like most of this category hypergiants are known to grow into irregular arcs and protrusions in a series of phases releasing considerable amounts of mass.

However recently researchers from the University of Arizona managed to trace these protrusions resulting in the capturing of the clearest image of a hypergiant star till date.

This was done thanks to the Atacama Large Millimeter Array radio telescope in Chile where astronomers traced specific molecules in the matter ejected from the gargantuan star.

Wikipedia

Then they mapped these traces to the images of the star previously taken by the Hubble Space Telescope to create maps of sulfur oxide silicon oxide phosphorus oxide and sodium chloride in the material that the star released.



The image was first revealed on June 13th at the 240th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Pasadena California.

What makes this discovery even more special is that hypergiants in the galaxy are already rare and we don’t have much knowledge about the second brightest stars in the constellation Orion Betelgeuse. And VY Canis Majoris situated around 3000 light years away from our planet in the Southern constellation Canis Major however is the largest of them all.

University of Arizona professor of chemistry Lucy Ziurys explained “With these observations we can now put these on maps in the sky. Until now only small portions of this enormous structure had been studied but you can’t understand the mass loss and how these big stars die unless you look at the entire region. That’s why we wanted to create a complete image.""

Solar-powered patio umbrellas sold exclusively at Costco have been recalled in the United States and Canada after some umbrellas caught fire authorities said.

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in a news release urged customers to “immediately stop using” the SunVilla 10 foot Solar LED Market Umbrella.

The umbrellas were produced by California-based SunVilla Corp. the news release says. They feature LED lights on the inside arms and a solar panel with a black cover at the top of the umbrella.

“The lithium-ion batteries in the umbrella’s solar panels can overheat posing fire and burn hazards” the CPSC said.

The umbrellas were sold at Costco warehouses and online for between $130 and $160 from December 2020 through May 2022 the CPSC said.

In the United States there were “three reports of solar panels catching fire while charging via the AC adapter indoors and two reports of umbrellas catching fire when the solar panel puck overheated and caught fire while attached to the umbrella and one smoke inhalation injury” the CPSC said.

SunVilla has received one report of a battery overheating and the umbrella catching fire in Canada with no injury according to a news release published on Thursday by Health Canada.

Around 400000 of the umbrellas were sold in the United States and around 33000 in Canada says the CPSC. The umbrellas were recalled jointly by the CPSC Health Canada SunVilla and Costco.

Customers should stop using the umbrellas and remove the solar panel puck (the piece that contains the lithium-ion battery) store it out of the sun and away from combustible material and not charge the puck with its AC adapter the CPSC says. The umbrellas can be returned to any Costco Warehouse for a full refund.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy9jb3N0Y28tc3VlZC1hbmltYWwtbWlzdHJlYXRtZW50LXJvdGlzc2VyaWUtY2hpY2tlbnMv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy9jb3N0Y28tc3VlZC1hbmltYWwtbWlzdHJlYXRtZW50LXJvdGlzc2VyaWUtY2hpY2tlbnMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Cost Of $4.99 Rotisserie Chickens: Costco Gets Sued For Animal Mistreatment,"(CNN) -- In 2019 Costco opened a $450 million poultry processing plant in Nebraska to produce millions of its staple $4.99 Kirkland Signature rotisserie chickens.

It was a rare step for a retail company to take but a sign of just how valuable rotisserie chickens are to Costco's business. The company has sold them at $4.99 for more than a decade lower than most rivals and uses them as loss leaders to draw customers into stores. Costco sold 106 million of the cooked birds last year.

But Costco now faces a lawsuit from two shareholders claiming that the company and its top executives violated animal welfare laws and in the process broke their fiduciary duties. The lawsuit calls into question the lengths Costco has gone to keep its key item cheap.

""Costco illegally neglects and abandons its chickens"" the suit filed this month in Seattle claims. Company executives the lawsuit states ""caused [are] aware of and consciously disregarded clear signs of Costco's ongoing mistreatment of chickens.""

Costco did not immediately respond to request for comment on the lawsuit.

As part of the operation Costco recruited farmers in the area to raise broilers to be delivered to the Nebraska processing facility.

But the suit alleges that Costco intentionally breeds these broilers too large in to stand on their own in factory farms and the ""disabled birds slowly die from hunger injury and illness.""

It follows allegations from another animal rights group about Costco's treatment of its chickens.

In 2021 Mercy for Animals filmed undercover scenes of injured chickens in a crowded factory at one of the farms. The video led to a story from a prominent New York Times opinion writer titled ""The Ugly Secrets Behind the Costco Chicken.""

In response to the article Costco defended its treatment of animals and said it adheres to standards developed by the National Chicken Council a trade association.

But Costco's practices could hurt demand for rotisserie chickens the lawsuit claims and harm its corporate reputation.

""As more consumers learn of the mistreatment of Costco chickens the benefits reaped using loss-leading rotisserie chickens to drive customer traffic and purchases . . . will vanish or greatly diminish because consumer preferences to not buy products made illegally or unethically will trump the lure of a 'cheap' chicken.""

The family of a Scottish schoolgirl who was crowned the winner of a prestigious gala have completely transformed their home into a pink two-storey high fairytale castle - fit for any princess.

Aimee Gilchrist 12 was elected to be crowned this year's Bo'Ness gala queen by fellow pupils at her Primary School in January report the Daily Record.

She then had to take part in a procession around the town in her gown in front of nearly 10000 people.

For her special day Aimee wore a stunning ivory dress and tiara which is regarded as the highest honour in the town.

The Bo'ness Fair was first held during Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 and is perhaps most famous for the dozens of themed ""arches"" that appear around the town to mark the event.

This year's main theme was ""Beauty and the Beast"" and the beautiful castle her family built was a part of the Fair.

Aimee's family completely transformed the front of their home into a fairytale castle 24 feet high and 32 feet wide - complete with a set of turrets.

And she doesn't just get a crown for her achievement. She will also represent the town and carry out a range of civic duties throughout the year. Her responsibilities are likely to range from grand openings and handing out awards to visiting care homes and switching on the Christmas lights.



The schoolgirl who celebrated her 12th birthday on Thursday said: ""I was shocked to be elected but it's the best thing ever.



""My sister Chloe and I were flower girls three years ago but I always wanted to be the Queen.



""When I found out I asked if I could have a castle as big as our house. It's amazing. My friends love it.""

Mum Morag 42 a paediatric nurse was born and raised in Bo'ness and was a fairy in the 1986 Fair.

Dozens of other family members have held ceremonial roles over more than a century from presentees and flower girls to ladies in waiting and Queen of the Fairies.

Aimee's great great grandfather Archie McKay was Yeoman of the Guard in the 1920 event.

And Morag revealed her youngest daughter may have been born for the role.

She said: ""Aimee was born the day before the Bo'ness Fair (in 2010) and I was worried I was going to miss the crowning in the park for the first time.

""When we were discharged from the hospital we came straight to the Fair. We got back in time for the procession. That was Aimee's first day after she was born and exactly 12 years later she's being crowned herself.



""I'm very proud of Aimee because it's the biggest honour you can have. She'll be known as the Queen for the rest of her life.""

Morag added: ""When Aimee found out she was to be Queen she said she wanted a Beauty and the Beast castle for her arch.

""My only stipulation was it was to be no bigger than the house. My poor dad George landed the job of building it but he had help.""



Dad Steven 42 said: ""Aimee's just taking it all in her stride.""

Local man Alan Christie is a friend of Aimee’s grandfather and helped build the castle.

Speaking to the Record he explained that although Aimee’s castle is unique in its colour and detail he says it is ‘moderate’ for Bo’ness Fair.

He said: “Aimee’s castle has been months in planning.

""We started sketching it out in January but didn’t start building until March when a local farmer let’s people in to use his barn.

“That offers plenty space to get things together and we worked on it from March right up until to the last couple of weeks.

“We used plywood for the walls the stain glass windows were made up of a special plastic and the paint was just ordinary stuff from B&Q but we used a layer of PVA glue to waterproof it that’s an old fair trick that has been getting used for years!

“We were happy with the finished product it is striking with its details and colours but compared to previous entries I would say it is fairly moderate in height for Bo’ness Fair.”

Bo’ness Fair began as a celebration of coal miners’ freedom. Until the end of the 18th century all Scottish miners were the property of the pits they worked in as were their children. In 1779 an Act of Parliament released them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vaXdvYnNlcnZlci5jby51ay9mYW1pbHktcHVicy1uZXctb3duZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Family pub's new owners – Isle of Wight Observer News,"Publicans Liam White and Simon Cant have added the Crown Inn Shorwell to their growing business interests.

The business partners already own The Castle Inn Newport The Vine Inn St Helens and New Inn Shalfleet.

They will take over managing The Crown on Monday (June 27) with the pub initially open for drinks only with food to follow within a week. Both had previously worked at the pub which was one of the reasons for taking it over. Liam said: “Part of it was sentimentality but we also want to bring it back to its former glory serving a traditional pub menu.”

Simon added: “When I was here before it had a good local following and we want it to once again be the heart of the community. We are a family-run business and we will have family members working here.

To encourage further development the Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC) has established a growth board for small to medium sized enterprises to be able to take advantage of initial public offerings (IPOs)

What is a publicly listed company?

A publicly listed company refers to a public limited company or permitted entity that has proposed or issued a public offer of securities.

Why does a company go public?

An initial public offering (IPO) is a way for companies to raise capital from the general public to expand business performance through the IPO which is an alternative to traditional options such as bank loans.

An IPO provides numerous benefits to the issuer – in addition to raising finance from the general public for future development and strengthening capital structure – including obtaining long-term funding sources tax incentives and establishing a strong reputation.

It also can boost public visibility which can lead to attracting greater attention from potential investors help achieve business sustainability with stronger corporate and internal governance attract and retain employees and increase proactivity to government regulations.

How to prepare an SME for a public offering?

After observing the growth potential of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) the Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC) decided to establish a growth board to allow SMEs to raise funds through public offerings.

CURRENT EQUITY LISTED COMPANIES

The securities sector in Cambodia has developed steadily since its establishment with nine companies now having listed their equity securities on CSX.

In order to go public SMEs have to undergo four major stages:

• Preparation: The company shall show good corporate governance (a management structure in accordance with the regulations in force) and a financial statement within the last financial year audited in accordance with the law and regulations.

The company’s business activities should be in the public interest and its operations sustainable. An IPO team will be established to check the due diligence of the company.

• Feasibility listing: The company shall comply with the listing requirements of the listing rule of CSX to be able to apply for the feasibility listing with CSX.

• Application to request IPO: The company shall prepare and submit its application to SERC for the IPO.

SERC will evaluate the application and all other relevant documents particularly disclosure documents before granting approval.

After obtaining approval and disclosure document registration from SERC the company shall process the securities subscription.

After the completion of the securities subscription the company has to submit the report on the subscription result to SERC.

•Officially listing on CSX: The company shall complete an application form to CSX to be officially listed in accordance with the regulations in force.

In game one the pitching by Osakis’ Lane Berberich and the defense behind him stole the show in a 6-0 shutout win.

“It was a great game” Osakis player/coach Doug Zimmel said. “Lane Berberich pitched a heck of a game.”

Berberich threw four strikeouts in his complete-game performance on the mound.

The Hawks (2-4) got on the board early in game one with a two-RBI single by Drew Fearing in the top of the first inning and with runs in the second inning off of a Hunter Infanger RBI triple and a sacrifice fly by Berberich. Luke Staloch had a triple to begin the second inning for the Hawks.

“Our defense played terrifically and our offense came together” Zimmel said. “It was a good all-around game.”

Brandon Giesler led the Hawks in hits with two while Carter Rost also had a hit.

Osakis added insurance runs in the fifth inning with an RBI single by Rost and in the sixth inning with an RBI triple by Berberich.

The Hawks’ momentum from earning its second win of the season didn’t carry over into game two as the script was flipped and it was Kensington that jumped out to an early lead and held on to win 5-4.

“We just hit the ball where their guys weren’t I guess” Kensington coach Eric Paulzine said. “We just hit a little better had better base running got the outs we needed and put everything together.”

Kensington who is 3-3 in league play had a 5-0 lead after the top of the third inning thanks to an RBI single by Eric Elbe in the first inning a two-RBI double by Kevin Jenks in the third inning a run off of an Osakis error and an RBI off of a fielder’s choice that Justin Cummins hit into.

Through three innings Osakis had been held scoreless.

“We moved some guys around (in the field) and made some defensive adjustments” Paulzine said.

Tate Breitkrutz shut the door on the Hawks in the bottom of the seventh to help Kensington hold on to the 5-4 win. Breitkreutz had three strikeouts in one and two-thirds innings pitched.

Elbe was the starter on the mound for the Norsemen in game two. He threw for five and one-third innings and struck out seven while allowing four hits and four walks.

He was the Norsemen’s reliever in game one and threw five strikeouts in five innings after Trent Kolowski pitched the first two innings of that game.

The Norsemen had seven hits in game two led by Elber with two. Isaiah Sykora and Breitkreutz also had a hit in the game.

In addition to the Staloch home run in the fourth inning the Hawks had hits from Giesler Fearing and Waylon Muenzhuber.

Rost threw for the first five innings of the game and had seven strikeouts. Mason Moore pitched the final two innings for the Hawks and struck out three batters.

“Our team is very close even away from the game” Paulzine said. “We are like a family; that is our biggest strength.”

And it’s this strength that Paulzine expects to lead to more growth as the season goes on this summer.

“We just got to hit the ball more in practice” Paulzine said. “We’ve just got to keep practicing keep working hard fix the little things and then I think we’ll get everything right.”

Zimmel described Kensington as a team with a lot of young talent with some older talented mixed in.

For Osakis Zimmel believes the bats will lead the way.

“When we can get the offense rolling we have some good at-bats” Zimmel said.

The Pat Cummins-led side into the five-day games from June 29 at the back of a recent 1-0 Test triumph in Pakistan where it played two draws before winning the final game. (Watch: Indian players asked to 'not sign autographs take selfies' during warm-up match; Rishabh Pant does it anyway) Nathan Lyon of Australia(Getty Images)

Lyon who has claimed 427 wickets in 108 Tests was a part of the Australian team that suffered a 3-0 whitewash in Sri Lanka in 2016. As he gears for another challenge against the islanders Lyon has recalled a chat with Rangana Herath and explained how the legendary tweaker changed his outlook while bowling in subcontinent conditions.

It was in 2011 when Lyon made his debut and removed batting icon Kumar Sangakkara with his first ball in Test cricket in Galle.

""I said 'What do you do that I don't do?' And he said 'I know that if I put the ball in one spot you blokes will stuff up'. Those were his exact words. That's a pretty simple mindset. (What) I took out of it was the secret to everyone's success is if you can challenge their defence for long periods of time you'll be able to create chances"" said Lyon.

""That's what (Herath) did extremely well. He challenged our defence for long periods of time and he got the rewards.""

Lyon also spoke about training with Muttiah Muralitharan during a week-long training camp at Colombo's SSC Ground back in 2014. ""I trained with Murali batted against Murali bowled with Murali for two or three hours a day"" said Lyon recollecting his first experience with the legendary off-spinner during a week-long camp at Colombo’s SSC ground back in 2014.

""So it was pretty remarkable spending time with him here in Sri Lanka probably the greatest Sri Lankan cricketer to ever play the game definitely the greatest (Sri Lankan) bowler.

""Talking to Murali it's not about me trying to bowl like him it's more of a mindset thing. I think I've been able to really learn off so many people around the world but Murali's mindset was pretty unique” Lyon added.

The off-spinner also said that their win over Pakistan in March has given them confidence that they can win in the subcontinent. ""It's purely the belief that our process and what we are doing is starting to work. We all know how hard it is to win games of Test cricket away from home.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQvbWF4d2VsbHMtdGVzdC1ob3Blcy1vbi10aGUtcmlzZS1kZXNwaXRlLWRldGVyaW9yYXRpbmctYmFnZ3ktZ3JlZW4tY3JpY2tldC1hdXN0cmFsaWEtZ2xlbm4tbWF4d2VsbC1hdXMtdnMtc2wtcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtdHJhdmlzLWhlYWQtNzk5MDcwNS_SAcIBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0L21heHdlbGxzLXRlc3QtaG9wZXMtb24tdGhlLXJpc2UtZGVzcGl0ZS1kZXRlcmlvcmF0aW5nLWJhZ2d5LWdyZWVuLWNyaWNrZXQtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWdsZW5uLW1heHdlbGwtYXVzLXZzLXNsLXBhdC1jdW1taW5zLXRyYXZpcy1oZWFkLTc5OTA3MDUvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sri Lanka vs Australia: Glenn Maxwell’s Test hopes on the rise despite deteriorating ‘baggy green’,"The “baggy green” cap awarded to Australian cricketer Glenn Maxwell on his Test debut has completely fallen apart after an extended spell in his closet the all-rounder said ahead of a potential test return in the upcoming series against Sri Lanka.

The 33-year-old who played the last of his seven Tests against Bangladesh five years ago was added to Australia’s Test squad as injury cover for middle order batsman Travis Head.

The baggy green is presented to Australian players when they make their Test debut and they receive just one for their entire career. “I took it out last year and had a look at it and it was deteriorating and I thought ‘that’s not a good sign’” Maxwell told reporters.

“My wife took it out yesterday and it had completely fallen apart. She said ‘I don’t think I can bring this’ it looked terrible. So I’m going to need a new one over here. It’s happened to a few of the boys. “I’m probably going to have to put it in a glass case and leave it there I reckon. I’ll see if I can get it fixed when I get home but at the moment it’s probably a bit too late for that.”

Maxwell added he is ready to play test cricket despite his lengthy absence from the longest format.”I’ve done a bit of red-ball work training wise always trying to stay ready just in case knowing there was a fair few sub continent tours coming up not just this year but next year as well” Maxwell said. “But at some stage you think you might give up hope but it was just so nice to get the tap on the shoulder.”

The first of two Tests in Galle begins on Wednesday."

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

Congratulations are in order for Michelle Dockery. ICYMI the Downton Abbey star is officially engaged to her boyfriend of three years Jasper Waller-Bridge. The pair started their low-key romance in 2019 and recently shared the news of their engagement in The Times.

""The engagement is announced between Jasper son of Michael Waller-Bridge of King's Lynn Norfolk and Teresa Waller-Bridge of Battersea London and Michelle younger daughter of Michael and Lorraine Dockery of Gidea Park Essex"" the announcement reads.

Now because you clearly need to know more about the future Mr. Michelle Dockery scroll down for a primer on all things Jasper.

Yes he's related to that other Waller-Bridge you've heard of.

Even if you had never heard of Jasper before chance are his name was instantly very familiar thanks to his sister Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge.

He works in the entertainment industry.

While Jasper isn't an actor like his famous sib he is also in the entertainment industry. He works as a TV and film producer and music manager in London and according to his LinkedIn profile he also founded a music production company called Day One Pictures in 2020.

He and Michelle Dockery have a very relatable meet-cute story.

Michelle and Jasper started dating in 2019 after being introduced by friends like a couple of normals. On a less relatable relationship note they were first spotted together later that year at the Rome Film Festival like a couple of famous people. Michelle walked the carpet solo at that event but she and Jasper did eventually make their red carpet debut at the Anatomy Of A Scandal world premiere earlier this year. And they looked SO. IN. LOVE.

He has a 1D connection.

In addition to his famous sister and famous fiancée Jasper has some famous work connections too. He has a background in talent management (he was Creative Development Director of YMU Group) and music (he's also worked as an executive at Island Records and Sony Music) and he put both skillsets to good use from 2017-2018 when he was Louis Tomlinson's manager. We assume (/hope) this means Jasper and Michelle's wedding will feature live music and that music will be performed by someone incredible.

England footballer Harry Maguire tied the knot with his childhood sweetheart Fern Hawkins on Friday in the south of France.

The Manchester United centre back has shared a photograph from the wedding on Instagram in which he is pictured kissing his wife at the extravagant ceremony at Chateau de Varennes.

The 29-year-old captioned the image “a day I’ll never forget”.

Maguire and Hawkins 27 had their wedding party made up of 30 guests flown by private jet to France on Thursday reports The Sun.

It is also understood that England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford’s wife Megan Davison was a bridesmaid at the event while Maguire’s sister Daisy assumed the role of maid of honour.

Friday’s nuptials follow an initial cermony held in a Crewe registry office last month to obtain a UK marriage certificate.

The couple got engaged in Paris in 2018 and have two daughters Lillie Saint and Piper Rose.

It comes after police have swept Maguire’s family home after the he received a bomb threat in April this year.

Addressing the scare Maguire said at the time: “Obviously I’m going to be criticised. Manchester United paid a large sum of money for me it is one of the most loved clubs in the world and one of the most hated.

“We know we are under the most scrutiny. I totally accept criticism when we concede goals or make mistakes. I’m big enough to accept people getting on my back and saying I can improve.

“But there is a line where we are human beings. I do have a family.

“It doesn’t affect me too much but when it comes to bomb threats it is more about family — my fiancée Fern.

While the movie does follow Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) as he trains new recruits to the Top Gun program (including Miles Teller Glen Powell and Ace Ellis) viewers were even more excited when they realized that Val Kilmer would be returning as Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky.

Now we know that Val himself was thrilled to be reunited with Tom as he emailed Entertainment Weekly and said that being on set together ""was like no time had passed at all."" But there were some special people in the actor's life who were even more excited to see him reprise one of his most iconic roles. Those people come in the form of his kids Mercedes and Jack who posted about their time on set with their father filming the movie.

""Finally allowed to post these pics from the @topgunmovie set :)"" Mercedes captioned a series of photos on Instagram. ""Maverick out now.""

Judging from the candid pictures Mercedes posted it looks like she and her brother had a good time hanging out with the cast and crew. The two wore aviator glasses and pilot hats in one photo and Mercedes even got Jack to pose alongside some extras. But the best pic of the bunch was a sweet moment between father and daughter snuggled together for an adorable selfie.





With Val going through serious health issues over the last few years seeing these private moments with his kids is a special thing to witness. And fans clearly felt the same way since they rushed to Mercedes's Instagram to share their feelings with her.



""Great movie!!! Tell your Papa he is a legend!! Lots of love to you all!! ❤️❤️"" one fan affectionately commented. ""We all love your dad so much"" another replied. ""Oh that last photo! ❤️"" one more fan wrote. We're absolutely feeling the love over here.

DHR,Danaher Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYmlvdGVjaC5ldS90cmVuZHMtbmV3cy9jZWxsLWdlbmUtdGhlcmFweS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cell Therapy Firm Raises €64M to Revolutionize Manufacturing,"This week’s €64M Series B fundraise from the French firm TreeFrog Therapeutics is the latest in a thriving movement to make the manufacture of gene and cell therapies easier and cheaper.

Cell and gene therapies offer huge potential to treat a wide range of diseases including cancer neurological and genetic diseases. They have even shown promise to treat the symptoms of Covid-19.

The amount of academic and early-stage biotech research in this area has skyrocketed over the last few years. According to data from the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine in January this year there are currently 1220 ongoing clinical trials in this space 152 of which are at phase III. Despite the global pandemic investment in this area is also at a record high around the world with the equivalent of €15.7B invested in 2020 a figure double that of 2019.

But research alone cannot get these complex treatments to patients. “The sharp discrepancy between the high number of products in early-stage development and the still very small number that have made it onto the market as well as their cost speaks to the impact and importance of cost-effective and scalable manufacturing” said Ryan Cawood CSO of the UK cell and gene therapy manufacturing firm Oxgene.

TreeFrog Therapeutics’ €64M Series B round was the latest effort to meet this challenge. With international expansion in its sights the firm aims to work with big biopharma players to produce cells more cheaply and at a better quality than current cell therapy manufacturing techniques. TreeFrog is also developing its own cell therapy candidates starting with a Parkinson’s disease therapy due to enter phase I in 2024.

“Solving the manufacturing issue in cell therapy means being capable of serving not just a few thousands of patients per year but millions of them with reproducible efficacy and consistent safety” said TreeFrog’s CEO Frederic Desdouits.

“I don’t believe that current cell culture technologies will ever meet that need. In fact I believe that with [our technology] we are the only ones playing in this new category.”

TreeFrog’s round joins the steady stream of biotech activity focused on advancing the manufacture of cell and gene therapies. Earlier this month UCB recruited the German firm Cevec to manufacture viral vectors for gene therapies. In July the heavyweight Danaher Corporation revealed plans to pump €1.3B ($1.5B) into the expansion of its cell manufacturing facilities. And earlier in the year we saw WuXi AppTec take over Oxgene PerkinElmer acquire Sirion Biotech and a range of collaborations including between Vigeneron and Daiichi Sankyo.

The early difficulties with manufacturing the approved Covid-19 mRNA vaccines in high enough quantities has really highlighted the importance of having a solid manufacturing strategy in place. This lesson applies equally to companies trying to take cell and gene therapies to market.

Stuck in the first generation

Despite the huge increase in development of cell and gene therapies over the past couple of years manufacturing technology for these therapies is largely still at the first-generation stage. This can make scaling up a challenge.

“Often cell and gene therapy manufacturing processes are highly manual – stemming from the early academic or process development stage and without adequate technology solutions available currently these processes often remain this way through clinical trials and then into commercial manufacturing” said Jason Foster CEO of Ori Biotech a London- and New Jersey-based company focusing on cell and gene therapy manufacturing.

“These first-generation processes cause manufacturing to be expensive highly variable and low-throughput which reduces the ability of patients to access these potentially life-saving therapies.”

Another problem common to all biological therapeutics is that any product sourced from a live cell or a component of one is subject to a lot more variation than a simpler pharmaceutical product.

“Most gene therapies are built on viruses found in nature. They have not evolved for very high productivity in a large-scale animal component-free bioreactor” said Cawood.

“The more complicated the biologic becomes the more parts of it require optimization and the more analytics you require.”

According to TreeFrog Therapeutics’ co-founder Kevin Alessandri there is also a lot of waste in cell therapy manufacturing.

“Yields are impaired by high cell death at every passage and genetic alterations inevitably arise” said Alessandri. “When it comes to producing commercial batches to treat thousands of patients scaling out 2D cell culture processes is far too expensive and poses batch-to-batch reproducibility issues.”

While many in the industry are now turning to bioreactors to produce cells on a bigger scale this is also not without problems. “Impeller-induced shear stress is damaging the cells thus negatively impacting cell viability and triggering undesired genetic mutations” explained Alessandri.

Taking manufacturing up a gear

TreeFrog Therapeutics’ way of overcoming common challenges in manufacturing cell therapy is to encapsulate the cells in a protective shell that reduces waste in the manufacturing process. The company launched an industrial demonstration plant in June last year followed by two co-development deals with undisclosed big pharma partners.

“Encapsulated stem cells spontaneously self-organize in an in vivo-like 3D conformation promoting fast and homogeneous growth as well as genomic stability” said Alessandri. “The resulting 3D stem cell colony can then be differentiated in the capsule into functional microtissues ready for transplantation.”

“With our technology which is based on high-throughput microfluidics capable of generating over 1000 capsules per second it becomes possible to expand and differentiate stem cells at a large scale in industrial bioreactors with best-in-class cell quality and reduced operating costs.”

Meanwhile Ori Biotech deploys robotics to minimize the number of manual steps needed to produce a given cell or gene therapy. This speeds up the process as well as making it more accurate. Another advantage of the technology is that it can tailor the production capacity according to demand.

“This is impossible to do in most current processes which involve manual tube welding and transfers from flask to bag to bigger bag to bioreactor” said Foster. Ori’s technology could take years off the production timeline and cut costs by as much as 80%.

London-based Synthace is one of several companies trying to improve advanced therapeutic manufacturing by developing software and computer systems to optimize the process rather than industrial machinery.

Peter Crane who was Synthace’s Corporate Strategy Manager until earlier this year said that in-depth data analysis and planning before starting the manufacturing process can make a big difference to outcomes and that connected software can help make this task easier.

“The best way to remove some of the risk associated with biomanufacturing of these products is to solve as many problems as possible before manufacturing.”

In addition to making the process quicker cheaper and more accurate computing tools can also help with quality control and tracking. “In cell therapy manufacturing especially autologous products line of sight around electronic batch records as well as the vein-to-vein supply chain is incredibly important” emphasized Crane.

Oxgene has a focus on scaling up viral vector production with less contamination and a 40-fold improvement in yield compared to current methods.

“Innovation in new manufacturing technologies just hasn’t kept pace with the level of discovery around genetic disease and potential avenues open to treat them or even development of the viral vectors themselves” said Cawood. “This is definitely changing though.”

Enter the second generation of manufacturing

Huge advances in gene and cell therapies over the last few years such as the approval of the eye gene therapy Luxturna and the first CAR-T cell therapies mean the demand for new manufacturing technologies has also increased exponentially.

“A lot of very promising programs are now in the pipeline and patients are waiting for their approval” said Alessandri. “Industry urgently needs robust manufacturing technology capable of serving millions of patients.”

European biotechs are busy developing second-generation technologies to allow easier and cheaper scale up producing higher quality products with less waste. They could start to phase out first-generation methods very soon.

The realm of cell manufacturing in industrial and food biotech is also likely to see big breakthroughs in the coming years. In January this year for instance the nutrition and health giant Royal DSM set up a lab in the Netherlands dedicated to applying artificial intelligence (AI) to the challenge of growing microbial strains at a commercial scale.

Rapid improvements in advanced computing options such as AI and machine learning technology as well as robotics are already having an effect on the industry but this will only get bigger as time goes on.

You’ve been warned.

It was announced this week that Dave’s Hot Chicken is set to open up a New Jersey location.

The California-based restaurant will set up base in the West Belt Plaza shopping center at 57 Route 23 in Wayne NJ.

I have to admit my mouth is watering just looking at their food but what intrigues me most about this chain is its origin story.

Per the company’s Instagram:

“In 2017 4 childhood friends with $900 in savings started a pop-up called Dave’s Hot Chicken in an East Hollywood parking lot.“

The chicken received great reviews and the friends' pop-up went viral on social media.

Daveshotchicken via instagram Daveshotchicken via instagram loading...

According to their site:

“A year later the boys had the money to open a shop in a hip strip-mall with décor by local street artists where the crowds continued to grow with wait-times of an hour and more. From there the incredibly craveable ‘Hot and Spicy’ varieties have created a cult following with rave reviews across the U.S. and Canada.“

I'm here for a ""rags to riches"" origin story especially if it means I get to eat something spicy.

You don’t have to be a fan of spice to enjoy their chicken (though it certainly helps) there’s a spectrum of spice.

The heat levels are as follows:

No spice

Lite mild

Mild

Medium

Hot

Extra hot

Reaper

“Reaper” for those who don’t know refers to the Carolina Reaper pepper which is 100 times hotter than a jalapeño pepper.

The Wayne location of Dave's Hot Chicken is expected to open later on this year likely in winter.

Will this be the first of multiple NJ locations? We can hope!

It's like it can come natural with a bit of love time and the desire.

I am not a real expert on all antiques and collectibles but I do write about them and do appraise a few. Also at one time I did a social study of kids at play and collecting.

From collecting kids can learn time and money management the history related to the item they are collecting or working on and how to care for their items. Some have even sold a few of their collections. Some children have even taken their collecting passion on to a full-time career or at least a part-time hobby to a business.

So what is the age most kids start at? Most are around 5 years old with that secret little box of treasures like shells from the beach rocks found that caught their eye or something a family member may have given them to start collecting.

Collect alongside a parent

Polly Johnson of Utica a mother to twins — Leah and Logan age 9 — and 5-year-old Liam tells how the boys started a collection “Logan and Liam’s tractors barns and animal collecting is actually a five-generation collection. Starting with the great-grandfather Merrill Johnson. He is still living today and resides in Osage Iowa where he actually built a old-time town on his property complete with a tractor collection of fully operational tractors.

The boys have some old tractors but love it when grandpa or grandma take them to the John Deere store to pick out a new tractor for their collection. They also like to look at flea-markets estate and garage sales. They have primarily John Deere tractors but also collect all the barns silos and animals.

""It’s a great hobby and they love to play with them” Polly says. As for twin sister Leah Polly says she “collects fidgets jewelry and lip gloss.”

Chris Rand Kujath owner Old River Valley Antique Mall in Stewartville tells us about her little helper learning and working along the way about antiques and collectibles.

“My granddaughter Destiny is working with us. She just started helping us out about a month ago"" Kujath said. ""Destiny also has a spot in a locked case with jewelry postcards trinkets and milk bottles. She is eager to learn the business. Destiny assists with customers at the register opening cases and cleaning and cleaning. At the present time we have given her things to add to her collection. Since school is out Destiny will start going to garage sales flea market and estate sales with her grandparents.”

Jenna Lubinski mother and owner of the Refinery Co. a furniture rehab staging spot and sales business in Winona says “I’m so lucky to have an extra sets of hands helping from beginning to end. I schedule pick ups while I have my girls for extra lifting.""

Once new finds are brought home Lubinski says granddaughters Lilly 15 and Kenley 14 help out with cleaning the item. Lilly uses the sander and Kenley paints.

""Little or big projects we have also dabbled in macrame crafts-staging and decorating their rooms and the shop"" Lubinski says. ""Both girls have jobs now along with sports camps over the summers but we always make time for markets and fun. This past Memorial weekend they assisted me at Elko Trader’s Market picking up some really great pieces for clients and the shop. They have been helping many years since they were young. They also have two wonderful and different style aesthetics which speak in their rooms they have helped style. When they are not working they help me stage Friday evenings and open the shop Saturday mornings. They are a wonderful contribution to The Refinery Co.”

Most of all collecting with kids can encourage fun because the best part is working together and being blessed with having these kids in your life learning and sharing together.

Jason Kokrak's second round at the Travelers Championship did not end the way he wanted it to. Left: Getty Images; Right: PGA Tour ShotLink

Veteran PGA Tour pro Jason Kokrak shot a respectable three-under 67 in the opening round of the Travelers Championship. With another solid round on Friday it looked like Kokrak would be playing the weekend in Connecticut. But his second round did not end as planned in fact it technically didn’t end at all.

That’s because after hitting his ball out of bounds Kokrak picked up his clubs and walked off the course in one of the most bizarre moments in an already bizarre PGA Tour season.

After hitting a long drive on the short par-4 9th hole on Friday Kokrak’s final hole of the round the 37-year-old airmailed the green entirely with his approach shot.

The PGA Tour ShotLink play-by-play tells part of the story:

Shot 1 327 yds to left rough 43 yds to hole

Shot 2 87 yds to unknown 44 yds to hole

But then the play-by-play ends with no further shots recorded. Why? Because after a brief search for his ball Kokrak decided to leave it wherever it came to rest and proceeded to walk off the course.

At that point Kokrak was four over on his round and fresh off a double bogey at the 8th and he had no hope of making the cut. As a result of his walk-off he was disqualified for failing to record a score on his final hole and failing to turn in a scorecard.

Rumors quickly spread that Kokrak may have fled the course in frustration maybe for good on his way to join LIV Golf but reporter Jason Sobel found otherwise.

In texts with William McGirt one of Kokrak’s playing partners on Friday Sobel learned that the group took a long time to determine 1. that the ball was out of bounds and 2. where the correct drop zone would be. Not wanting to force the group behind them to wait in the fairway Kokrak decided to pick up and change his MC to a DQ.

Texted with Will McGirt who was playing with Kokrak. They didn’t realize the ball went OB. By the time he could figure out where to drop the group behind was waiting. He didn’t want to hold them up and was going to MC anyway. But it wasn’t some walk-off from PGA Tour life. — Jason Sobel (@JasonSobelGolf) June 25 2022

Kokrak who is ranked No. 33 in the Official World Golf Ranking has three PGA Tour wins in his career all coming since 2020. The most recent came at the Houston Open in November 2021. In 16 starts this season he’s missed the cut three times but this is his first disqualification.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vbGFuY2FzdGVyb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3dpbGxpYW0taGVucnktYmVyZ2RvbGwvYXJ0aWNsZV9jZDkwNDBiZS00ZDQzLTU0NjEtYTg4Zi01MjkwMTI5YTk2MTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,William Henry Bergdoll | Obituaries | lancasteronline.com,Success!

Respecting a brand inspires you to be forgiving.

Most people -- not so many admit it -- allow their preferred brands to fail occasionally in the belief that the benefits ultimately outweigh the pain.

Yes even if it's an airline.

Which makes me wonder what is going on at Delta Air Lines.

For many years it was easy to believe that Delta had their act so (relatively) together. This was a clever operation run by clever people.

The airline occasionally even boasted of its efficiency thoughtfulness and of course deep wells of brand love.

Yet it's suddenly looking like well any other airline. Or some might snort even worse.

Over the last few weeks I've heard from friends who expressly booked Delta and were severely pained.

A flight that was canceled without a rebooking was available the next day. A flight that was so delayed that the whole purpose of the trip was ruined. And one who witnessed the chaos in Atlanta as scores of people were left stranded by Delta at the airport for 24 hours.

Five Flights. Five Bad Experiences.



It couldn't really be that bad could it? I wanted to believe my friends were still anomalies.

But then I read of the suffering endured by five people flying into Detroit on Delta. Detroit is one of Delta's hubs. It's where you might expect -- I suppose I mean hope -- that the airline has its planes in a row and enough staff ready to fly.

Yet as told by the travel site Miles to Memories this was the tale of frequent flyers members of the site's community all trying to meet up together. They discovered that Delta was miles away from creating happy memories.

Five people taking different flights from different cities into Detroit last weekend offered tales of woe that suggested severe organizational incompetence the sort you don't associate with the Delta brand.

Sample: ""Flying Boston to Detroit [one flyer] had their flight canceled Friday morning a few hours before their flight. They ended up having to take a stand-by flight in the afternoon. This was after waiting hours in line at the airport to get their flight booked since everything was sold out online.""

A familiar story for many travelers you might think.

But how about this: ""Flying from the East Coast a member had their three flights canceled completely and they were unable to make the meet-up at all.""

Then there was the Detroit-bound passenger whose redeye from San Jose on Thursday was canceled and they ended up arriving at 4 am on Saturday morning.

Another ""had their non stop flight changed to a 3-leg flight that would have gotten them in at midnight.""

Perhaps the most telling however was this: ""Flying from DCA (Washington DC) to Detroit the member had their flight canceled Friday morning."" What did this person do? Why ""they ended up being able to find an American Airlines flight to rebook themselves on at the last minute.""

If a popular view might be that if American Airlines has a solution available and Delta doesn't it's worth wondering about the Earth's axis.

The Last Temptation Of Cash



I contacted Delta to ask why the airline was undergoing such a manifest mangling of its reputation. I'll update should a response arrive.

I also asked whether the airline wishes it had done something differently in the past. This seemed an appropriate question as airlines are blaming the weather and that all-encompassing term ""staffing shortages"" for the current travel chaos one that looks like it'll have a long run.

When the pandemic came along airlines begged the government for many many billions. And got them. Those billions were supposed to be used on keeping employee teams together. Airlines promised that no no they wouldn't shed employees and trouser the cash.

Yet a look at Delta's numbers for 2021 shows that the airline spent 16% less on salaries and related costs than in 2019. Pilots and flight attendants were allowed to take early retirement. Some suggest that up to a third of all Delta's employees drifted away. Even today Delta has 10000 fewer employees than it did before the pandemic.

So now Delta and the rest are trying frantically to hire. Or are they? Recently Delta CEO Ed Bastian remarked: ""We're largely where we need to be for staffing.""

The airline has hired 4000 people this year. How many though have any airline experience? And how many are thrust into the job with very little time for training? How many even turn up on the first day of work?

It's All Good. Well Mostly. Well Maybe. Or Not.



Last week Delta updated a blog post on its site. Its headline read: ""Delta continues to focus on improvement in hot summer travel season.

Hot is apparently a euphemism for disastrous.

Delta's summary offers: ""In recent months we've made several adjustments to minimize schedule disruptions and bounce back faster when challenges occur.""

It claims: ""For June weekends month-to-date Delta's network system weekend cancellations are down 35% from May."" Imagine indeed how bad May was. I wonder how much of that was the weather's fault.

Delta insists that its employees are ""working around the clock to support you."" Well some of its pilots are picketing to show you how bad in their view the airline has become. They're even writing open letters to Delta customers saying the pilots' union has ""lost confidence"" in management. That's a kind of support for customers I suppose.

Some may find it poignant that the airline decided last week to release some new advertising. ""Start Your Odyssey"" it declared. ""Take new chances"" it added. All a little difficult when your flight just got canceled and there isn't another one for at least another day.

Airlines will of course insist that the sudden demand for travel is unprecedented and couldn't have been predicted. It's as if they had no human psychologists on hand there to guide the airline away from any money-cornering habits.

How much would Delta have now gained if it had kept more of its employees during the pandemic -- please let me dream -- and been truly prepared for the current human desperation to fly somewhere anywhere?

I'm being silly of course. Revenue comes first. Headcount can always be fixed right?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5kZWx0YS5jb20vZGVsdGEtaXNzdWVzLXRyYXZlbC13YWl2ZXItZHVlLWZvcmVjYXN0ZWQtd2VhdGhlci1ub3J0aGVhc3Rlcm4tdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta issues travel waiver due to forecasted weather in Northeastern US,"Due to forecasted weather in the Northeastern U.S. Delta has issued a travel waiver for those who may be impacted – effective June 27 2022.

The Joint Venture Agreement (JV) between Delta Air Lines and LATAM Airlines Group received provisional approval and antitrust immunity from the Department of Transportation (DOT) on Thursday. The US Tentatively Approves Delta-LATAM JV.



Delta-LATAM JVA approved – kinda.

The DOT believes the Delta-LATAM JV will likely generate public benefits while the US-South America market would remain sufficiently open to existing and new competition. Nonetheless it has placed certain conditions on final antitrust immunity.

The DOT said: “the Department proposes the following critical remedies and conditions to address these issues: maintenance of current third-party interline agreements the removal of exclusivity provisions a 10-year expiration and reassessment requirement and the removal of a capacity constraint clause located in the joint venture agreement which artificially limits growth during the initial stages of the proposed relationship.”

The two parties now have 14 days to respond to the tentative decision. In a joint statement the airlines said:

“LATAM Group and Delta Air Lines welcome the US Department of Transportation’s (DOT) preliminary decision to approve their US/Canada-South America (Brazil Chile Colombia Paraguay Peru and Uruguay) Joint Venture agreement which will significantly enhance travel options for customers traveling between the two regions. Once the DOT confirms its decision the airlines will work to deepen their strategic alliance enabling them to offer consumer benefits including increased flight availability more routes between the US/Canada and South America enhanced frequent flyer benefits as well as access to shared facilities and services at the airports where the airlines operate.”

A closer look at Delta and LATAM’s JV

Both companies announced they would file for a Joint Venture Agreement in 2020. This JV would allow them to plan price and share revenues and costs covering routes between the United States and Canada on one end and the South American region on the other. It would also allow them to compete better against American Airlines and United Airlines which already have partnerships with Latin American carriers such as GOL JetSMART and Copa Airlines.

The proposed JV is an incremental profit and loss-sharing alliance that provides for metal

neutrality between the carriers and covers all nonstop flights between North America and the South American regions as well as flights connecting to the nonstop services that operate within the geographic scope of the proposed JV.

According to the two airlines the JV will:

Cover 7000 city-pair markets;

Provide new or expanded service on at least 18 nonstop routes;

Provide approximately $460 million in estimated annual consumer benefits;

Optimize connectivity between Delta’s and LATAM’s hub networks;

Lower prices by jointly setting fares and managing seat inventory by up to $56 million annually;

Create an immunized network that provides critical mass to compete against the larger American Airlines and United Airlines networks in the region; and

Use efficiencies of the combined operations to optimize aircraft utilization enhance schedules and lower costs with a joint sales force to target key customers.

The benefits

With the JV in place Delta and LATAM estimate they will attract 1000000 more annual U.S.-South America passengers that would have otherwise flown on competing carriers. They estimate capacity will increase more than 68% once demand conditions return to pre-pandemic normal levels.

Both carriers’ networks are largely complementary and the only route overlap exists in the New York-Sao Paulo city-pair market. LATAM and Delta proposed new reinstated or expanded services on at least 18 routes.

Moreover if the JV is approved LATAM will have increased access to North American markets over Delta’s Atlanta Boston Los Angeles and New York City hubs and Delta will have increased access to over 160 South American markets over LATAM’s hubs at Bogota Lima Santiago and Sao Paulo.

It was Boston-based Northeast Airlines which served New England (and later the nation) from 1933 until the summer of 1972 when it became part of Delta Airlines.

Now a half-century later a ‘Return of the Yellowbirds’ gathering will take place in Manchester on Sunday July 31. Organized by the Aviation Museum of NH the event will bring together ex-employees family members passengers and fans of the airline which is remembered for its catching “Yellowbird” jingle and eye-catching yellow and white livery.

“You still hear it today—people who worked for Northeast loved the airline. They thought of it as one big family” said Jeff Rapsis executive director of the Aviation Museum of N.H. whose father was a Northeast Airlines pilot in the 1950s and 1960s.

“This summer’s reunion is a chance for Northeast veterans as well as family friends and the airline’s many fans to celebrate a special company renew old friendships and also carry the Yellowbird legacy into the future” Rapsis said.

The event which is open to all takes place on Sunday July 31 from 4 to 8 p.m. at the DoubleTree by Hilton Downtown Manchester 700 Elm St. Manchester N.H. The event includes a gourmet dinner served buffet style a display of historic artifacts and Northeast Airlines uniforms the premiere of a new video honoring Northeast Airlines and more.

Tickets are $75 per person with all proceeds to benefit the Aviation Museum’s youth education programs. Tickets may be purchased by phone at (603) 669-4877 or online at www.aviationmuseumofnh.org. The event is sponsored by Delta Airlines with major support from Manchester-Boston Regional Airport. For questions please call the Aviation Museum at (603) 669-4820.

Special guests will include Lynda Valdez a Delta Airlines flight attendant hired by Northeast Airlines in 1969 and who remains on active duty today 53 years later. Also attending will be former Northeast pilots flight attendants mechanics and other personnel many of whom worked for Delta for decades after the merger."

As I wrote last month the days where top leaders ruminate in isolation over key decisions are over.

To succeed organizations must evolve and change their current business processes and how they work with data. Here are three top barriers that can hamper a successful data culture and how organizations can overcome them.

Overcome fear of data

If employees are afraid of data through misplaced concerns or unfamiliarity with the environment they will consciously or unconsciously avoid using it whenever possible. This will have the effect of dampening data initiatives before they even get started ultimately sabotaging the effort to establish a data culture.

Training and discussions are essential to alleviate this fear of data says data consultant Vanessa Lam. Rather than handing licenses of tools to new analysts and assuming their skills have prepared them to deal with the organization’s data Lam recommends providing short education sessions on the tools offered by the organization its data and data best practices.

Data is tricky and there are specific ways it can and cannot be used she explains. Hence such training sessions aren’t about rote learning but about communicating nuances such as when and how to ask questions as well as an introduction of relevant resources to help users understand and rectify common data issues.

“Up front data education is beneficial to provide context and resources before new analysts have a chance to develop bad habits... These training sessions make them feel as if they are a part of the analyst community and help them feel comfortable discussing data issues with other analysts across the organization” she explained.

Address mistrust of data early

Another issue is mistrust of data which arises when insights turn out wrong due to incorrect data or erroneous interpretations. This culminates in a vicious cycle of increasing caution and a greater likelihood of subsequent analyses being binned the moment an error is detected. Over time wider margins of error are added with greater hesitancy to leverage data eroding its value.

The solution is communication says Lam who advocated a formal system of tickets and informal feedback. She wrote: “If analysts are not aware of known issues and fixes in the works every new problem they encounter becomes an unknown unknown. They assume small errors are indicative of larger ones and spend their time checking the data instead of doing analyses.”

Communication is a two-way street and is not limited to users bringing up potential issues or problems with data to the operational team. Instead the data team should also communicate issues that they identified and rectifications they are making to the data – even when no one is complaining about them.

Finally familiarity with data builds confidence. This means establishing a culture of discussing data during office hours including a conscious attempt to incorporate data in all decisions starting from the top.

Break the barriers to data access

Sharing data among stakeholders and team members within the same organization might seem obvious. But the reality is that data sharing across lines of businesses can be difficult and even risky from a compliance point of view. For this reason and more employees typically end up putting data in silos to avoid the risks inherent to data sharing.

According to Glan Jackman of data access platform Immuta efficient data management is a central component of successful data initiatives. While one would expect them to say just that Jackman argues that with the creation of standardized centralized processes for the injecting classifying storing and organizing of data businesses can ensure that data is accessible and used appropriately.

In other words democratizing data access does not mean giving access to all and instead is inextricably linked to data governance. The onus is on businesses to create an environment suited for data sharing through the establishment of proper data management and a strong data management framework. Only when business units and teams are assured that proper controls are in place can we expect silos to be bridged.

Finally we have written before about how the cloud can simplify data-related sharing and processing. While this is true it is worth noting that as organizations turn to multiple cloud platforms the result could be a patchwork of cloud-based capabilities that don’t scale consistently says Jackman. To be truly effective data access and control should extend across all cloud platforms.

It takes the entire organization to build a robust forward-looking data culture. But with proper training open communication and robust data sharing businesses can get off to a good start.

If you received this in your inbox thank you for signing up and your vote of confidence. If you’re reading this as a post on our site sign up here so you can receive it directly in the future. Every week I’ll take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week.

There’s a lot of fintech news out there and it’s my job to stay on top of it — and make sense of it — so you can stay in the know. Let’s goooo! — Mary Ann

I was mostly off this past week so this edition of The Interchange may be slightly less dense than normal. Some observations though. We saw fewer layoffs but also less fintech-related news in general. Things were generally pretty quiet and not filled with as much controversy as weeks past. Honestly we’re really eager for this quarter to end so we can drill down into the numbers to see just how much the funding landscape has changed compared to 2021. Until then we took a look at some recent numbers.

Fewer deals larger rounds – but still way down

My dear friends and co-hosts on the Equity Podcast Alex and Natasha last week discussed the fintech funding market not once but twice — here and here. Meanwhile it felt like there was a bump in fintech-related funding announcements. That got me curious enough to reach out to my old friends at Crunchbase to get some data on just how much fintech startups have raised in recent weeks. (Keep in mind that it is preliminary and there is also a lag — so there will most certainly be more deals and dollars reported for the same time periods in the future.) I was mostly expecting to see a bump in numbers. And I did sort of. Here is what the data showed: Globally funding was up very slightly in terms of dollars raised but deal volume was down significantly last week compared to the weeks prior. Specifically Crunchbase found that fintech startups raised $1.5 billion from June 16 to June 23 across 39 deals — compared to $1.4 billion raised across 53 deals the week prior and $1.2 billion across 59 deals 2 weeks prior. This tells us that there were more earlier-stage deals closing earlier this month while this past week we saw far fewer deals but larger round sizes.

We saw a similar trend here in the U.S. According to Crunchbase fintech startups in the United States raised $400 million across 10 deals from June 16 to June 23. That compared to $300 million raised across 14 deals the week prior and $300 million raised across 17 deals 2 weeks prior.

But notably and perhaps even more startling is the difference between these numbers compared to June 2021. Globally fintech startups raised a total of $8.2 billion across 272 deals from June 1-23 2021. That compares to a total of $4.2 billion across 151 deals during the same time period this year. Meanwhile U.S.-based startups raised $1.9 billion across 101 deals from June 1-23 2021. That compares to a total of $1 billion across 41 deals during the same timeframe this year. Whoa. That’s like nearly half the dollars raised both globally and in the U.S. So while this is just a small snapshot in time it is still indicative of what we all know is taking place — a global slowdown in funding and proof that fintech is not immune.

For the record Crunchbase defines fintech as companies that integrate technology in the financial services sector.

Takeaway: Fewer funding deals are closing in the fintech space and during the month of June at least investors seemed to be taking more bets on later-stage companies so dollars raised actually inched upward as the month wore on. This means it is likely getting tougher and tougher for earlier-stage companies to win over VCs who are reportedly conducting more due diligence and asking for more traction than in the whirlwind that was 2021.

Weekly News

The buy now pay later (BNPL) market estimated to be worth $120 billion in 2021 has grown significantly over the last few years. But for most of its rise to virtual checkout prominence BNPL largely targeted everyday consumer goods like clothes from Urban Outfitters or a Peloton. Now the credit method is moving beyond its e-commerce roots. In the past few months large companies have joined the BNPL market also hoping to quickly approve consumers for installment loans. Rebecca Szkutak digs in here.

Speaking of BNPL Sweden’s Klarna has (finally) launched a new loyalty card feature in its app which it says allows users to store and access all of their physical loyalty cards as digital versions removing the need to carry physical cards while out shopping in-store. The company is clearly working to boost its number of users considering that its valuation has reportedly been slashed from $45 billion to $15 billion a cut that our own Alex Wilhelm deems to be “sufficiently steep.”

Scoop: Three more senior executives of digital mortgage lender Better.com have resigned I reported last week. Those three executives are Jillian White general manager of Better’s affiliate businesses known as Better+ which consists of its title/settlement insurance and home inspection departments; Megan Bellingham who was senior vice president of sales and operations; and John Moffatt who served as vice president of sales.

Brex issued a mea culpa this week after its shocking announcement from last week to stop working with SMBs. Pedro Franceschi founder and co-CEO addressed the stumble in a blog post titled simply “About last week’s announcement.” In the post Franceschi expressed regret over the “poor job explaining this decision which eroded some of the valuable trust” Brex had built over the years. He also outlined what criteria a business needs to meet to qualify to remain a Brex customer.

Speaking of Brex and SMBs Tillful — a free business credit app built by VC-backed startup Flowcast — announced last week that it is launching a new feature for its users through a direct partnership with Experian in an effort to better inform business credit scoring in SMB/SME lending. The startup claims it is a “first-of-its kind partnership” between a fintech and a major credit reporting agency “in an effort to make credit risk assessment more ‘open.’” Flowcast has developed AI-based credit models for lenders and is backed by ING Ventures and BitRock Capital. Since Tillful was launched it says that over 50000 small businesses have signed up to help manage and build their business credit.

Here is where it gets even more interesting in light of Brex’s recent news: Flowcast’s latest move a spokesperson told TechCrunch reflects its “doubling down on SMBs.” Brex that spokesperson added was actually one of its partners but Flowcast hadn’t heard from them “in quite some time as they stopped engaging” with the company months ago: “We haven’t received any communication from them either as a long time Brex cardholder and lender partner but we are moving off of their platform and will be using our own card in lieu.”

Meanwhile Mercury — a digital bank aimed at startups — claims that it has already seen hundreds of new accounts come to its platform in the wake of Brex’s announcement and that it is “seeing more everyday” a spokesperson told TechCrunch on June 24.

Brazilian digital real estate broker QuintoAndar launched last week in Mexico City the first time the startup has expanded out of its home country. It will operate in the country under the brand “Benvi” which will be the proptech’s international name. Last August QuintoAndar announced it had raised $120 million at a $5 billion valuation. In April the company laid off 160 people or 4% of its staff — making it one of a few highly valued Brazilian startups cutting jobs.

While we’re on the topic of LatAm Brazilian digital bank Neon has announced that it has hired a Silicon Valley tech veteran who has held stints at Google Snap and Coinbase as its new chief technology officer. André Madeira is the former co-founder and CEO of Meemo which was acquired by Coinbase last year.

But standing out won’t be an issue for Brittany Davison’s baby whose name is Seven Simba.

The unusual moniker has seen Brittany receiving some cruel messages from trolls and has even prompted her to share her son’s birth certificate on TikTok.

But the mum of one insists that if Seven grows up to dislike his name he can make the decision himself to change it.

In a comment on a video in which Brittany revealed the other names they’d considered before Seven one person wrote: “ok Simba is a cute character but how did you come up with seven.”

“Just a name we liked! Plus 7 is a significant number in our lives/relationship so it just made sense” Brittany replied.

“We love it and so do my partner’s other kids.

“Seven is more than welcome to change it if he wants to when he’s older!”

Other people were less complimentary with their comments and questions with one writing: “there is noo way ur baby is called seven simba.”

“You have got to be joking. You’re really not?…??? Wow” another added.

“Awful names” someone else commented as another wrote: “poor kid gotta grow up with that name rest his life.”

“And you’ll wonder why he changes his name to Steven when he’s 18” another comment read.

“He’s more than welcome to change his name the same as someone called Katie might prefer to change their name” Brittany responded.

As for the other names they’d thought about Brittany revealed they’d considered “Teddy Blu Phoenix Mowgli and Killian”.

“My daughters nickname is mowgli” someone else wrote.

“Love it!!! I was set on Mowgli being his middle name but my partner said he preferred Simba” Brittany answered.

A study by Scotts Miracle-Gro and Wakefield Research in 2020 found that 55% of American households garden in some way.

1 TikTok user nataplant recommended shopping at Walmart for potting soil

Another 20% of American households responded that they plan to start gardening in the near future.

The study also found that 67% of adults are growing or planning to grow edible plants like fruits vegetables and herbs.

Between the work it takes to maintain a garden and the products you need to buy it can be an intensive and expensive hobby.

To help other gardeners find affordable potting soil TikTok user who goes by nataplant posted a video showing the prices at her local Walmart.

Nat who runs the account spotted 50-quart bags of MiracleGro potting soil for $13.

She said she compared prices at other home goods stores and saw prices of $14 to $16 elsewhere making Walmart the cheapest option.

While prices can vary by location Home Depot and Lowe's sell the same bag of soil for $16.47 and $16.48 respectively.

At those prices Walmart offers up to 20% savings on potting soil.

And on Amazon similar-sized bags of soil go for closer to $40.

Costco however may have Walmart beat when it comes to affordable soil.

Members at the wholesale store have spotted 50-quart potting mix bags for as cheap as $7.49.

Other savings on soil

As Nat and many TikTok commenters noted shopping around different stores isn't the only way to find deals on bags of soil.

Many home goods stores have a policy that shoppers can get damaged or partially opened bags at a discount.

Some consumers have reported getting up to 50% off open bags.

However Nat said her local Lowe's only offered 10% discounts on torn bags so policies may differ by location.

Lowe's Walmart and Home Depot did not immediately respond to requests for comment about their current open bag policies.

Another Walmart shopper shared how you can find hidden clearance items.

And see how you can save 90% on a key household essential with a savvy Dollar Tree trick.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9jb2xvcmZ1bC1nZWZvcmNlLWd0eC0xNjMwLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQtcGljdHVyZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colorful GeForce GTX 1630 graphics card pictured,"Colorful’s new entry-level GTX card leaks ahead of launch

Surprise surprise the GTX 1630 looks exactly like the GTX 1650.

We have two renders of the upcoming GeForce GTX 1630 from Colorful. The company is set to introduce the BattleAx model which represents the entry-level segment. The card features dual-fan cooling solution and single heatsink covering the full length of the card.

Despite the fact that this model is not factory-overclocked it ships with an additional 6-pin power connector. Furthermore it is a full-custom design with three display connectors: DVI HDMI and DisplayPort. So yes there are still cards released in 2022 with DVI ports.

Colorful GTX 1630 BattleAx features TU117 GPU with 512 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory. Unlike the GTX 1650 this model has reduced bus width to 64-bit which severely limits its bandwidth and performance at higher resolutions.

Mackenzie Lynn Smith who is from the US took to TikTok and shared a short clip where she explains that she decided to get in her husband’s car wearing nothing but a very revealing black lace bodysuit.

Only she was left mortified moments later when she spotted her husband’s grandmother sitting in the backseat.

In the video Mackenzie says: “I’m going to get changed. He’s going to be here in a couple of minutes. Let’s hope he likes it.”

Next she’s seen rushing out of the garage donning a very sexy piece of lingerie as she tries to avoid the gaze of any neighbours.

It’s only when she tries to get into the car that the penny drops as she realizes her husband isn’t alone.

While her husband’s grandma appears visibly shocked Mackenzie says she had the perfect response and joked: “Well hi sweety don’t you look cute.”

The post has since gone viral and racked up an impressive 16.5 million. views – and has been inundated with comments from very amused social media users.

“’Don’t you look cute’ aww granny” wrote one.

Steve Price one of the judges on the Fox television show “Domino Masters” brought a team of domino artists to the school to create a chain reaction machine that broke a world record for the longest domino wall ever created.

Deanna Doede assistant principal and athletic director at Trillium Academy said the school has a connection to the show through third-grade teacher Kristina Price who is Steve Price’s sister.

The team of artists created a wall consisting of 54321 dominoes but the total number of dominoes used for the event was 100000. The wall wrapped around the entire gym.

According to Doede the dominoes that were not part of the wall were used to create multiple chain reactions within the gym.

“One of our students Emily Wright actually started the topple” Doede said. “The wall itself was the final piece that toppled. There were multiple chain reactions that led up to that incredible moment.”

It took almost a week for the artists to assemble all the dominoes and when the day finally arrived for the topple to take place staff members and Trillium families awaited in eager anticipation.

Of course it also was quite a thrill for students to talk to Steve Price and his fellow builders with many of them getting their autographs.

“They were so excited to meet several of the domino artists they’ve watched on the television series ‘Domino Masters’” Doede said. “It was definitely a day we will all remember. We love the fact that they chose to bring their creativity and skill to Trillium — and broke a Guinness world record in our gym!”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9yeWFuc2Nob2NrZXQyL2FteS1zY2h1bWVyLWRvbWluby1raXJrZS1maXJlZC1kb3VsYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amy Schumer Fired Penn Badgley Wife Domino Kirke As Doula,"Well Amy actually fired Domino and explained — to her husband! — why.

However she won't be exactly the same.

Deadpool is a superhero film that redefined the genre of comic book films with a wisecracking antihero and plenty of jokes that broke the fourth wall. Starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular hero Deadpool was wildly successful spawning a 2018 sequel Deadpool 2 that introduced a host of new characters. One of the most popular new characters was Domino played by actor Zazie Beetz. With fans eagerly waiting for Deadpool 3 many wonder whether Beetz will reprise her role and whether she’s on board for the sequel.

Deadpool 2 was in many ways a darker tale than what viewers enjoyed in Deadpool. The sequel film featured Wade Wilson/Deadpool struggling to cope with life after his girlfriend Vanessa is killed in a failed attack on him. After reluctantly agreeing to join the X-Men Deadpool finds himself on the run from Cable a supersoldier from the future who is hell-bent on killing Deadpool.

Assisting Deadpool as part of the newly-formed X-Force team of antiheroes is Domino a mercenary mutant who can manipulate luck. Domino is a badass who suffers no fools and immediately forms a back-and-forth rapport with Deadpool. Fans loved the character of Domino and embraced the vibrant energy that Beetz brought to the role.

What did Zazie Beetz say about Domino returning in ‘Deadpool 3’?

While Deadpool 3 seems to be in limbo for the time being Beetz is definitely on board to reprise the role of Domino. In a November 2021 interview with Comic Book Beetz opened up about the hotly-anticipated film and what she thinks about playing Domino again. “I would love to revisit Domino” Beetz said. “I would love to do a Deadpool 3 4 5 7 19. I’ve also wanted to be like ‘Maybe I could just do my own origin story.'”

Beetz added “I feel honored to have been able to depict her on screen and to have played with her as her. I love her and so I would be more than happy to revisit her on camera. And I think I will. If Disney doesn’t make it happen I’ll make it happen.”

While Beetz clearly has a lot of love for the character a tragedy affects her return. In 2017 during the making of the film stuntwoman Joi “SJ” Harris Beetz’s stunt double was killed in a motorcycle crash. According to Deadline the crew immediately shut down production on Deadpool 2 temporarily. So should Beetz return a different person will perform Domino’s eric stunts.

What do fans know about ‘Deadpool 3’?

A new stunt double for Domino likely won’t be the only change in the Deadpool universe. According to The Digital Fix there’s no official word on a release date for Deadpool 3. And with Reynolds kept busy with other projects it seems as though filming hasn’t even started yet.

However the publication reports that the film will be taking place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe which should provide fans with plenty of opportunities to enjoy cameos and clever references to other established MCU characters and storylines. For now Domino and Deadpool fans will have to wait to see what’s to come for the third installment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml3bWJ1enouY29tL2RpZ2l0YWwvdmlyYWwtdmlkZW9zL2RvbWlub3MtZGVsaXZlcnktZ2lybC1iYWRseS1iZWF0LXVwLWJ5LWZvdXItd29tZW4taW4taW5kb3JlLzIwMjIvMDYvMjbSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5pd21idXp6LmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsL3ZpcmFsLXZpZGVvcy9kb21pbm9zLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWdpcmwtYmFkbHktYmVhdC11cC1ieS1mb3VyLXdvbWVuLWluLWluZG9yZS8yMDIyLzA2LzI2L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dominos Delivery Girl Badly Beat Up By Four Women In Indore,"Dominos Delivery Girl Badly Beat Up By Four Women In Indore

It is disheartening how the powerless are suppressed all around the world. But sometimes the act of suppressing someone can really get out of limits.

And today a shocking incident viral on the internet from Indore where a group of four women inhumanly beat up a young female worker of a pizza chain although she pleaded to leave her.

In the video clip it is clearly visible how the group of four women are beating the victim with sticks and kept hitting her even when she fell to the ground.

While female Pizza delivery employee is seen crying and howling for help but nobody even tries to help her out. People were watching her getting verbally and physically abused by the stick and the hands of four local women who were allegedly a local gang.

The victim even screamed that she’ll complain to the police to which the assaulters said “Go file a police complaint”. The beaten-up victim is reportedly an employee of Domino’s Pizza and she has been identified as Nandini Yadav as reported.

However the girl finally somehow managed to save herself by hiding in a nearby house.

The whole incident was shared on Twitter and there were several comments about the incident and people who didn’t help the victim.

Shares in Domino's Pizza Enterprises Ltd (ASX: DMP) have been killed in 2022. The Domino's share price has fallen 60% from a 52-week high of $167.15 in September 2021 to $66.15 at market close on Friday.

Domino's was among the pandemic winners on the ASX. Immediately before the crash the Domino's share price was trading at about $62 — a few dollars lower than today's share price.

Then people were put into lockdown. Takeaway and delivery meals became extremely popular. Brands like Domino's actively leveraged the pandemic to grow their business through measures such as a 'zero contact delivery service' to entice more customers.

Now that lockdowns are over has the Domino's share price simply come back down to Earth?

Domino's grew alongside its share price during COVID-19

In a recent presentation Domino's outlined its growth during the pandemic and plans for future growth.

Domino's has franchises all over the world. According to its presentation there are currently 3327 stores across 10 markets. Six are in Europe and four are in the Asia-Pacific region.

Over the two years of the pandemic network sales increased by 29.5%. EBIT increased by 25.2% and the network's store count increased by 24.3%. They're the stats for H122 compared to H120.

What Domino's is going to do next…

Over the long term Domino's is aiming for 3600 stores in Asia-Pacific (83.8% growth) and 3050 stores in Europe (123% growth).

The presentation described the ""engine of our growth"" as digital sales with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.75% since FY14. Online sales accounted for $557 million in sales in FY14 compared to $2.93 billion in FY21.

Customers are increasingly wanting their food delivered. In Domino's markets online food delivery orders in the quick service restaurant (QSR) sector are forecast to rise 46.9% by 2026 according to Statista.

The challenge of this rising trend is finding enough staff to meet the increasing demand for delivery. So growing the labour pool is a priority.

Domino's intends to grow its customer base by spending more on advertising particularly television and growing its store network.

The company says it's also possible to reduce delivery costs by a third in every market. One way to do this is to reduce the reliance on cars to deliver food and instead use bicycles.

Domino's acknowledged current global economic headwinds in its presentation.

U.S. stocks fell on Monday following a major rebound last week from this year's steep declines. Wall Street is preparing to wrap up the worst first half for stocks in decades. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 62.42 points or 0.2% to 31438.26. The S&P 500 dropped 0.3% to 3900.11 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.7% falling to 11524.55. The major averages struggled as investors weighed whether stocks have reached a bottom or are instead briefly rebounding from oversold conditions. Stocks could get a lift in the near term this week as investors rebalance their holdings for the end of the quarter. Stocks sank lower in the afternoon after wavering over the flat line earlier in the day. The day's moves had been ""tepid"" Baird's Ross Mayfield told CNBC noting that there still isn't a clear catalyst driving what has been and will continue to be a ""meandering"" market. ""In these kind of bear market rallies it's more about things getting a little too oversold a little too negative"" he said. ""But those aren't enough on their own to really sustain the rally they just can provide relief in pockets.""

Mayfield noted that any signs of meaningful easing in inflation would be a positive catalyst for stocks. ""From here the expectation is probably once again that we've hit peak inflation even if the rollover is very slow and that financial markets should see reduced volatility into year-end"" said Tom Tzitzouris head of fixed income research at Strategas. ""If we see another push higher in inflation however all bets are off and volatility should accelerate again."" Tech and consumer names dragged stocks down on Monday as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield crept higher. Gaming names Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive were down 3.5% and 3.3% respectively. Best Buy fell more than 3.4%. Etsy was the top decliner in the S&P 500 down about 3.6% following a downgrade by Needham. Shares of Spirit Airlines fell nearly 8% after the company said it would accept the latest takeover bid from Frontier Group. The energy sector was a notable gainer up about 2.8% for the day. Valero Energy climbed 8% while Devon Energy advanced about 7.5%. Marathon Oil added nearly 4.9%. BioNTech shares also climbed 7.2% after the drug maker said its Omicron-based Covid-19 booster generates an improved immune response against that variant. Those moves followed a major comeback week that saw the 30-stock Dow jump more than 800 points or 2.7% on Friday. The S&P 500 popped 3.1% and the Nasdaq Composite surged 3.3%. Those gains helped the major averages post their first positive week since May.

Dow and his wife Lauren Shulkind announced in May that his cancer which was first diagnosed many years ago had returned. His death was mistakenly reported yesterday July 26 via his official Facebook page in a since-deleted message from his management team. Today (July 27) it was confirmed by his son Christopher that Dow had in fact passed on.

In a Facebook post made today Christopher is quoted: “Although this is a very sad day I have comfort and peace that he is in a better place. He was the best Dad anyone could ask for. He was my coach my mentor my voice of reason my best friend my best man in my wedding and my hero. My wife said something powerful and shows the kind of man he was. She said: ‘Tony was such a kind man. He had such a huge heart and I’ve never heard Tony say a bad or negative thing about anyone.'”

Leave it to Beaver began airing in 1957 and ran until 1963. The black-and-white TV series was a huge hit centered around a wholesome 1950s family living in the suburbs. While the show’s namesake was the mischievous young Beaver himself Dow’s role as Beaver’s pragmatic older brother Wally was essential to rounding out the charming family dynamic.

The show’s run ended in the early 60s but Dow returned to the role in the 1980s for the TV movie Still the Beaver and series The New Leave It to Beaver for which he directed five episodes and wrote one. Dow also began writing producing and directing executing several episodes of Harry and the Hendersons Honey I Shrunk the Kids and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine among others. Dow appeared on many more series as an actor as well including General Hospital Lassie and The Love Boat.

Mathers who played Beaver wrote his own touching remembrance of Dow on Facebook: “He was not only my brother on TV but in many ways in life as well. Tony leaves an empty place in my heart that won’t be filled. He was always the kindest most generous gentle loving sincere and humble man that it was my honor and privilege to be able to share memories together with for 65 years.”"

However Carrie built a strong bond to her stepmother Marlena Evans as a child. Carrie first met Austin Reed (then Patrick Muldoon) as a young adult in 1992 when he moved into the apartment next to hers. Austin was a young and fit boxer who instantly captured Carrie's attention (via Soap Opera Digest).

It was later revealed that Austin was the brother of Billie Reed (Lisa Rinna) and the son of Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow). Carrie became friendly with Billie and the two women moved in together. Of course this meant that Carrie and Austin saw each other more often. While Carrie and Austin began dating and falling in love his career as a boxer took a toll on their romance. Although things were rocky it wasn't until Carrie suffered a horrific attack and had acid thrown in her face that things went sour for the couple per Soaps in Depth.

At the time Roman had told Carrie that if she didn't call things off with Austin he would be forced to arrest him. So she pushed Austin away despite her love for him (via Soap Central). During this time Carrie's sister Sami Brady had developed a huge crush on Austin and vowed to steal him away from her big sis. When Carrie and Austin split Sami wasted no time trying to win Austin's heart.",,,,,,,,,

“Oh wow is all I can say. It was totally amazing” said Sawula 63 of Westland.

He’d just taken a spin in the “interstellar white” truck at a special event DTE Energy had set up outside its Detroit headquarters to let customers try out various electric vehicles.

In addition to the Hummer a Chevrolet Bolt Ford Mustang Mach-E Ford F-150 Lightning Polestar 2 Volkswagen ID. 4 Rivian R1T and two Teslas the Model Y and S were available for drives along a route that circled through Corktown and back to the headquarters building off Bagley.

“The pep and the power” of the Hummer were more than Sawula expected. If only the sticker price were a bit less General Motors might have a new customer. This particular model with extras like interior ambient footwell lighting and mirror projection lights with the Hummer EV logo raised the standard vehicle price from $108700 to $112839 which includes the $1595 destination charge.

Instead Sawula a Michigan Department of Corrections maintenance supervisor at the Detroit Detention Center will likely stick with his 2013 Ram 1500 4x4 and the $125 a week he’s spending these days on gas. He bought a travel trailer but the spike in fuel prices has put a vacation “out of the picture for now.”

Still one part of the goal of DTE’s event this weekend was apparently accomplished when it came to Sawula who said the Hummer’s giddy-up blows the 5.7-liter Hemi in his own truck “out of the water.” He said he’d previously thought electric vehicles were underpowered and unable to tow a trailer but that’s not his impression anymore. The Free Press has previously reported that the Hummer with a range of 329 miles on a charge can tow up to 7500 pounds and has a payload of 1300 pounds.

DTE told customers about the event through email inviting them to sign up for time slots over two days Saturday and Sunday but into Saturday afternoon there had been a number of no-shows so getting to drive wasn’t an issue. The company said 320 people signed up.

The initial high demand for slots however — about 450 people tried to sign up for this weekend — prompted DTE to plan an additional event for July 23.

Walk-ups are welcome 8 am. to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday but there’s no guarantee you will get to drive a vehicle. Rides will only be available if those who signed up are late or fail to show up. And of course a valid driver's license is required.

Milena Marku manager of EV strategy and programs at DTE said the EV ride and drive program launched in 2019 but had to be put on hold because of COVID-19. This weekend’s Detroit event marks the first rides for the program this year.

Getting behind the wheel of an EV helps familiarize people with what they can do and allay some of the concerns that are often raised such as range anxiety (the fear that an EV might not have enough juice to get a driver to his or her destination) Marku noted.

“You can take long trips in Michigan” in an EV Marku said pointing to a DTE estimate of 1000 public charging locations in the state 400 of which are fast chargers.

Most experts also note that many EVs with ranges in the hundreds of miles have more than enough range to serve daily driving needs.

And of course with gas prices being such a focus these days the cost of charging up vs. gassing up is a big selling point for EVs. The estimate for charging overnight on the DTE rate plan geared toward EV users equates to less than $1 per gallon of gas according to the company. For regular unleaded gasoline the average price per gallon as of Saturday was $5.07 in Michigan and $4.91 nationwide according to AAA.

“That’s a pretty big savings” Marku said.

One of the questions that’s often raised about EVs is how they will affect the electrical grid. When asked whether brownouts were possible from widespread EV adoption Marku shook her head “no.”

She said the company’s annual investments in its infrastructure are sufficient to meet that demand.

“We can evolve at the same pace as the need” she said.

More:With summer heat and storms brewing some say Michigan is headed for brownouts

More:Buyers have supercharged interest in electric vehicles as gas prices surge

More:More car buyers ready to consider EVs but lack of charging access remains hurdle for some

For Andrew Lipps. 33 of Rochester the event offered a chance to try out more EVs. In the past he has driven Teslas.

He currently leases a Jeep Grand Cherokee L and would be interested in a vehicle with a third row like his Jeep.

Like everyone else he’s experiencing the high cost of fuel that’s “eating everybody alive.”

Lipps believes the future is electric and he’s starting to see more options with both vehicle choice and easier access to charging stations. That’s a key development for him because “one of the biggest struggles is charging” he said.

Lipps who is a software consultant but used to work in the automotive industry said that based on what he’s seeing now “it’s clear that Ford and the other automakers are serious” about moving to EVs.

Back in 1972 it was Partridge Family heartthrob David Cassidy singing for a screaming throng during a matinee show — which started late. This year meanwhile there were more cheers than screams at the 99.5 WYCD Hoedown celebrating its own 40th anniversary with six and a half hours of country music six acts executed with precision on two stages at an amphitheater with a larger capacity and plenty of cosmetic upgrades from its original incarnation.

What was the same however is both shows took place at a place called Pine Knob now that the place has returned to its original name after 20 years as the DTE Energy Music Theatre. And 50 years on whether it’s Cassidy or country people still go there to come on get happy.

Brooks & Dunn the Hoedown’s headliner is no stranger to the Knob either; Saturday was in fact the duo’s 12th appearance there and its first since in the metro area since its 2010 farewell tour — although since reuniting Brooks & Dunn has played at Caesars Windsor with Reba McEntire in 2016 and at the Faster Horses Festival in Brooklyn Mich. two years later. “We’ve had a lot of bad-ass parties in this place” Kix Brooks said early during the show. “And it feels like we’re fixin’ to do another one tonight.” He and partner Ronnie Dunn later noted that their tour manager Bill Thompson was at Pine Knob during the inaugural season with the band Bread on Aug. 27 1972.

Following main stage sets by “American Idol” winner Scotty McCreery (who announced that he and his wife are expecting their first child in November) and Tenille Townes Brooks & Dunn and their seven-member band came out steaming on a hot ozone-action night tearing into “Brand New Man” “Put a Girl In It” and “My Next Broken Heart” and they didn’t take their feet off the pedal very often — focusing on the rockin’ honky tonk hybrid that’s their stock in trade and dialing down only for a couple of quieter heartstring-pulling numbers such as “You’re Gonna Miss Me When I’m Gone” and Dunn’s emotive “Believe.”

During another ballad “Neon Moonlight” Dunn battled cottonwood that floated onto the stage acknowledging that “I’m struggling up here” and wiping and scratching in full view. “That’s not sexy at all” he said with a chuckle. “But it’s itchy!”

“Red Dirt Road” was treated to a quiet opening arrangement that built into the song’s anthemic grandeur while an extended version of “Rock My World (Little Country Girl)” was one of several songs that gave Brooks a chance to stretch out on harmonica. Townes came out to cover part of McEntire’s part of “Cowgirls Don’t Cry” and closed the main set with their hit cover of B.W. Stevenson’s “My Maria.” The duo had fans doing the “Boot Scootin’ Boogie” in the aisles on the concourse between the pavilion and lawn before bringing the show — and this leg of its Reboot Tour — to a close with an exuberant “Only in America.”

Meet four people who make that one week in Traverse City unforgettable

By Lynda Wheatley | June 25 2022

You could probably guess that pulling off a weeklong national festival that attracts thousands of people is no small feat. You might even know that a huge contingent of the people who make that festival happen are volunteers. But did you realize that some take a week’s vacation from their job to volunteer? Or that others who get a small stipend work dozens of hours before and after the week of Cherry Fest to ensure the event or element they run is an exceptional experience?

Until we talked with these four folks helming some of the biggest most beloved traditions at the Traverse City National Cherry Festival we didn’t either. Here’s a look at what brought them in what drives them and what keeps them coming back.

Kyle Clute | Director Parades

How I started: “I had a really good friend who was the parade director for the Junior Royale Parade [around 2009] and he was looking for some help. I told him I’d be willing went down there to pitch in and for most years since I've been pretty much committed. In 2015 I got the assistant director job. And then next thing I know I’m in the weeds and I’m doing it.”

On starting over: “In 2019 we had the best parade season we’ve ever had. It was like a train. All the little glitches had been ironed out everything went off without a hitch. It was just perfect. So we were planning on 2020 being even better. And then—COVID-19. No parade. In 2021 they asked us to do a standing-only parade out at Grand Traverse Resort. We started from scratch. We basically haven’t had the Cherry Festival parade in three years. We had to knock all the rust off and figure everything out again.”

Current status: “We pretty much start talking about the parades in November lining up marshals and cars and getting commitments from people. Right now it’s crunch time. I think about one or two weeks out a lot of people at the festival start sweating it. It just gets real right?”

Big challenges big wins: “This year getting marching bands has been a struggle. With fuel prices it’s hard for them [from around and out of state] to drive up to northern Michigan and back. Over the years we’ve had a lot of people on social media asking about local bands our high school bands—how come they’re not involved. And it’s usually that the kids are too busy. They’re at baseball soccer football camp summer jobs—all over the place. But this year the Trojans the Titans and the Gladiators are all going down the route and that is one of the big points we’re really excited about that Traverse City’s high schools are pretty well-represented in the parade.”

When to catch the parades:

- Consumers Energy Very Cherry Porch Parade: July 2-9 in neighborhoods around town

- Consumers Energy Community Royale Parade: July 7 at 6pm

- DTE Energy Foundation Cherry Royale Parade: July 9 at 11:15am

Katherine Brege | Race Director Meijer Festival of Races

Duties: “Overall I organize all the operational aspects of the four races [5K 10K 15K and half-marathon]. I communicate with the NCF office 26 volunteer groups local police water supply T-shirt design Northwestern Michigan College the timing company TCAPS etc. to make sure all aspects of the race run smoothly.”

I live for: “The morning of race day. I’m up at 3:30am to connect with my team. We have four locations that day that need to all run smoothly—late packet pick-up at Central High School; the half-marathon start at Old Mission Elementary; the 5K 10K and 15K start at NMC; and the finish line on Union and Front streets … along with the 10 water stations along the courses.

Unexpected snafus: “For two years in a row the route under Murchie Bridge [at the mouth of the Boardman on West Bay] was underwater.”

Expected snafus: “Every year we have people show up at NMC for the half-marathon which starts way out on Old Mission Peninsula because it’s a point-to-point race not a loop. Once a runner showed up at the finish line at 7:10am and asked ‘Where does the Half start?’ The [volunteer] pointed to the peninsula and told him ‘13.1 miles that way.’ We do the best we can to get everybody where they need to go but in some cases we just can’t.”

I know that it’s all OK when: “I hear from the half-marathon start that the runners are off and [we’ve sent] our runners out from the main starting spot at NMC. Then when I hear that runners are arriving at the finish I take a deep breath … and start to clean up. That’s my quiet time just picking up all the stuff after the race.”

When to run the Meijer Festival of Races (all July 9):

- Priority Health 5K starts at 7:30am

- Michigan Planners 10K starts at 7:50am

- Michigan Planners McKinley Challenge 15K starts at 8:05am

- Half Marathon starts at 7am

Angela Sayler | Director Queens Program

How I started: “I was blessed to be named the National Cherry Queen 2009-2010. The next year Kay Relyea director of the Queens Program at the time asked me to join the committee as her assistant director. Kay took me under her wing and ultimately groomed me for when she was ready to hand over the baton.”

Duties: “As the title implies me and 12 other ladies on the Queens Committee—the Queen Team as we affectionately call it—set up appearances for the queen at NCF and throughout the year. The bright and shiny part the component that most people see is that we chaperone the queen and court to any and all appearances … but behind the scenes we are fundraising coordinating events securing festival wardrobe and food sponsors recruiting potential candidates finding judges and donating our time talents and energy to ensure the queen and court have the opportunity of their lives.”

Why I do it: “I had one of the most memorable years of my life as the National Cherry Queen and made so many wonderful friendships. I knew I wanted to stay involved and help however I could.”

Surprise: “Before my younger sister Sonya [Sayler] Gallagher [NCQ 2013] encouraged me to apply I had no idea what went into planning and executing an event of this magnitude. We grew up as the sixth generation on a fruit farm—predominately cherries—so we were typically working on the farm harvesting cherries at festival time. But the things we both remember most are the traditions that have kept the festival alive. … I like to think that the Queens and the Queens Program is at the root of the NCF tradition so it’s incredible to have the opportunity to help continue that for generations to come.”

When to meet the National Cherry Queen:

- Opening Ceremonies at the Open Space on July 2 at 10am

- Princess Tea at Great Wolf Lodge on July 5 at 10am

- Festival Fashion Show at Great Wolf Lodge on July 6 at 4:30pm

- Queen’s Coronation at Hagerty Center on July 8 at 5:30pm

Jan Phillips | Director Ambassador Oasis

Duties: “I feed between 250 and 325 [Cherry Festival volunteers and workers] per day. I have them sign in so I have a pretty accurate count. We have a permit from the health department and we grill hot dogs brats and burgers right on site. And I have a big buffet line with a salad bar and fruit—for all those vegetarians and health nuts. A lot of watermelon bananas plums—whatever is on special that day. I go shopping every day. The first day I fill three shopping carts.”

Radio handle: “Lunchbox.”

Do you have help? “If I can corral somebody to go [shopping] with me but usually I need them at the tent. As I say I have been doing it so long [23 years at Ambassador Tent] we’ve refined it to a point where it almost works by itself. … I try to get three or four people [working in the tent] per shift and I have three shifts per day four hours each. I have a lot of people who return year after year so that helps.”

Where is the Ambassador Tent anyway? [Silence.]

A hint? “That’s a secret. It’s supposed to be a respite for these people that work all the time. They can go and sit put up their feet have a meal or a snack. Some people take a nap. We just let them be. It’s away from the noise I’ll tell you that much.”

Why I do it: “I got involved in the Cherry Fest [30 years ago] because I got tired of trying to fight through all the traffic in town and I just thought ‘I might as well join and be a part of this nonsense instead.’ If you live in Traverse City you have to partake.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L211c2ljL2JyaWFuLW1jY29sbHVtLzIwMjIvMDYvMjUvcGluZS1rbm9iLTUwdGgtYmlydGhkYXktaG9lZG93bi83NzM3NzkwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pine Knob notches its 50th birthday with Saturday country festival as summer shows roll on,"Pine Knob Music Theatre marked its 50th birthday with a little boot scootin’ boogie.

Throngs of fans piled into the amphitheater Saturday for the latest edition of the 99.5 WYCD Hoedown a two-stage affair set to culminate with an evening set from Brooks & Dunn.

Gates opened at 4 p.m. half a century to the day — indeed nearly to the hour — after Pine Knob debuted with a matinee David Cassidy concert.

That June 25 1972 show launched a long and storied run for Pine Knob which long ago cemented its spot as one of the most successful summer music venues in the U.S. The golden anniversary is the focus of a season-long campaign at the amphitheater.

History was embodied backstage in the form of Brooks & Dunn tour manager Bill Thompson a concert business veteran who worked his first Pine Knob show two months after the amphitheater opened — in August 1972 when he was lighting director for the soft-rock band Bread. He was greeted Saturday with a celebratory banner in the catering area.

While the 50th birthday milestone certainly wasn’t lost on Saturday’s concertgoers most were preoccupied with the party at hand a seven-hour country extravaganza that also included main-stage performers Scott McCreery and Tenille Townes. Many had warmed up for the long day tailgating in Pine Knob's parking lots where country tunes blared from trucks and car trunks.

The 15000-plus fans in the capacity crowd were scheduled to receive a commemorative anniversary poster when they left the venue later that night.

The Hoedown doesn’t have quite the history Pine Knob has seen through the decades but it’s an institution in its own right. For 32 years it was a downtown Detroit staple before moving in 2016 to the grounds of the Clarkston venue then known as DTE Energy Music Theatre and scaling down to a single-day event.

Music kicked off Saturday with a set from smoky-voiced newcomer Kassi Ashton while Parmalee made its first Hoedown appearance since 2014 playing a set that included the reigning No. 1 country song in the U.S. “Take My Name.”",,,

DURHAM N.C. (WTVD) -- One person is dead after a shooting that caused a wreck and power outage in Durham Saturday.

Police in Durham responded to calls about a shooting just after 2:00 p.m. in the 2700 block of Holloway Street. Upon arrival officers found a man with a gunshot wound inside of a car. Police say after the shooting the victim's car hit a utility pole causing a power outage along Holloway Street from Junction Road and Lynn Road. He was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

An eyewitness who moved to the area on Wednesday said she was unpacking when the car crashed in front of her house.

""My mom yelled ""the car is coming this way"""" she said. ""So we ran into the house and I was looking out the window and I saw the passenger jump out of the car while it was moving and ran through my yard so we jumped down on the ground and then we heard the car crash.""

The shooting is the second deadly one to happen in less than 24 hours in the same area after a teenager was shot and killed.

""After hearing that and then seeing this today it made me a little nervous"" the witness said. ""Because I have a part time job and sometimes my hours are late so it kind of makes me nervous to come home late at night by myself.""

Both shootings are under investigation but investigators said the shooting involving the man doesn't appear to be random and does not appear to be an incident of road rage.

The witness who's a Durham resident said she's concerned for her safety with an uptick in gun violence.

""Recently it's like all the time"" she said.

Saturday's shooting comes as the City of Durham signed off on a budget that includes a new crime-fighting tool ShotSpotter which would give police officers a precise location of gunshots allowing for faster police response times.

""It took them a while to get here but this is the first time I ever witnessed anything like this"" the witness said.

The victim's name has not been released yet as police continue to investigate.

According to officials Duke Energy is working to restore power.

There are no more details at this time.

John R. Cooney 73 of the Village of Lake Deaton was booked Wednesday at the Sumter County Detention Center. The arrest follows an incident earlier in the week in which he was ticketed on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident. Details of that incident were not available.

Cooney had been free on bond in connection with a 2021 incident in which he allegedly stole jewelry and medication from the home of his estranged girlfriend. She had arrived home from a dog park to find him in her house without permission according to an arrest report from the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office. After he was removed from her Village of Osceola Hills home by law enforcement she discovered that jewelry and medication were missing.

The California native is facing charges of theft and burglary in that incident.

As a result of this most-recent arrest Cooney has been freed on $30000 bond.

Unbeknown to her then as she set foot in England for the first time in three years after her family returned from her father’s overseas posting this ‘sense of belonging and where you are from’ was to form a recurring theme in her books.

History family backgrounds relationships dual narratives and unexpected twists and discoveries are rich traits of her work that has seen her become a best-selling writer since her first book The Dream House was published in 2006.

Grandfather’s diary

It was as we sat discussing her 12th novel One Moonlit Night that she reflected on that scene on Southampton dockside in the late 1960s having been recently reminded of that day with the discovery that it was written down in her grandfather Philip Harlow’s diary.

Transcribing it for the family as a lockdown project there in his own handwriting was early evidence of this sense of belonging that Rachel has carried throughout her life and into her literary persona.

Born in Epsom Hospital she was brought up in Surrey before her father Richard - a civil servant in the Ministry of Defence - and schoolteacher mother Phyllis went overseas when she was five.

“While it was interesting” recalled Rachel “I did not want to go at the time. I had just started school and was settling as a young child but everything got left behind.”

Sense of belonging

How much she missed England was defined in the joy at returning; an emotion which left such an impression on her grandfather that he felt it worthy of writing in the diary that she is now rediscovering and methodically typing up for the rest of the family.

“A particular theme I write about is that of belonging and identity” said Rachel “finding where you belong both in terms of place and your family.

“I have always been very clear that I belong in this country and never understand when people say ‘I am going to emigrate I hate Brexit this place is a dump’.

“How can you do that: your country has raised you paid for your education and health and everything else and you are part of it particularly when there are so many people who want to stay where they are and can’t.”

Born in 1900 her grandfather began his diary in 1960 - the year Rachel was born - writing about his upbringing and life.

“Nobody read it before he died but it is a very special thing to have” added Rachel who also did not realise until she began the transcription that the lines she uttered as she bounced ashore that day had been recorded so precisely by the man who greeted her.

Drawn to Cornwall

Despite the upheavals of modern times in the UK Rachel has a pride in being English specifically of her Cornish heritage and now as an inhabitant of East Anglia.

“My birth name is Cornish which I have always been very proud of” she continued. “Cornwall has always been an important part of my life; it is where my father came from and right from when I was quite small I was drawn to Cornwall as a holiday place and where we went to visit our relatives.

“But it is also as a very romantic place that somehow when you are a young person growing up you are convinced world circulates around you; to be up on the jagged granite cliffs with the storm and fabulous blue sea suits your teenage mood.

“So it is one of my romantic places though Norfolk has become that as well though the landscape is so incredibly different.”

Commissioning novels

Rachel went to school in Surrey read Modern History at St Catherine’s College Cambridge and after a taking a secretarial course began work at publishing company William Collins.

Her first editorial job was checking the proofs of a Stephen Donaldson fantasy book and a Tom Clancy novel before she began commissioning novels.

She was Barbara Erskine’s editor and worked with authors Susan Howatch and Sidney Sheldon thriller writer Craig Thomas and then went onto the Aga sagas and chicklit.

In the 1980s with smaller publishing houses taken over by larger media companies William Collins became Harper Collins.

“I remember shaking hands with Rupert Murdoch when he bought the majority interest in Collins. We were a global company and everything began to get a bit more corporate.”

Paperback publication

She met husband David - author and biographer DJ Taylor – when they were 27 after she was assigned to work on the paperback version of his first novel Great Eastern Land.

“It was quite odd reading Great Eastern Land because half is completely fictional and about a young man who is out east somewhere oriental and exotic and the other half is about a young man growing up in Norfolk. It was a very strange way of getting to know my husband before I had met him!”

Having married in 1990 she stayed with Harper Collins until 2001 before the family moved from London to Norfolk and their current home on the outskirts of Norwich with their three children Felix Benjy and Leo.

“I idealised the move to this lovely cathedral city but did not know Norfolk. Apart from a visit with a sales rep to Norwich I had not been to Norwich or Norfolk before meeting David” she said.

“I did find it very odd being here to start with partly because everyone knows everyone else everyone knew David’s family and it seemed everybody knew about me before I had met them.”

Creative writing

Finding herself at home looking after three young children Rachel began the transition from publisher to author.

She continued freelancing for Harper Collins and taught on the UEA creative writing course while assessing manuscripts and reviewing first novels for The Guardian.

“I did that for quite a while but did not feel I had anything that was going forward it was just bits and pieces. Then my father died suddenly in 2002” she said.

This encouraged her to write and initially she explored writing stories for women’s magazines though found they often went beyond the allotted word count.

She soon realised that material suitable for a small story and material suitable for a character who is going to become the hero of whole novel were quite different.

The Dream House

Then one day she noticed an ex-colleague had written a novel that had gone into bestseller list and thought “if she can do it then I can do it too.”

“The Dream House I suppose was about all of the things that had been happening to me in recent times” continued Rachel.

“It wasn’t specifically about the loss of a father it was about the loss of a sister but it was also about a publishing woman who gives up her job and moves with her family to Suffolk.

“I felt I wanted to put a sort of distance into proceedings and had a fictional village near Southwold in mind. I also put into it the experience of looking for the perfect house which we spent a long time doing.”

Norfolk skies

A pivotal moment was the drive back from seeing her mother one weekend with everybody else asleep in the car.

“As I drove east into the evening with those Norfolk skies and the sunset behind it was a very liberating feeling” recalled Rachel.

“My thoughts just started flowing and by the time we had reached home I had worked out most of the overall storyline of The Dream House.”

From there it was a case of padding out the tale assisted by a chance reading of an EDP story about an elderly man who lived in a ‘house of treasures’ in Banningham and was moving into a residential home.

“He had been an antiques dealer and had this marvellous old house absolutely full of antiques and curios and was having a ‘people’s auction’ at the house.

“You could go and look in advance to see all the different lots; I just wandered around and made lots of notes and looked at all the curios and moved this wholesale into my novel with an elderly woman sitting in a house full of treasures. I really enjoyed writing that book.”

Romantic possibilities

Rachel acknowledges she has set several of her books either partly or almost entirely in Norfolk and regards the county as a source of inspiration.

“But whereas David is writing about Norfolk and Norwich from the inside I suppose I am a bit of an outsider” she concedes.

“I am constantly - like with Cornwall - seeing the romantic possibilities of the Norfolk landscape the marvellous old houses the thatched roofs and the bleak landscapes and loving them all because I have adopted them. But I am still seeing them as an outsider would.”

Following The Dream House she was adamant her second novel in the two-book deal - The Memory Garden - would be Cornish.

“I had a lot to draw on there; my father had been a trainee land agent in Truro in the early 50s and visited huge estates in Cornwall and described these grand places falling into disrepair and I found a house and a garden that I could use as the basis of the story” she said.

“I am very aware that I write about houses but they have such metaphorical importance; houses can be places of security and warmth and comfort and love or they can be the complete opposite places of nightmare.”

One Moonlit Night

Rachel's novels often feature two narratives past and present that weave into one another.

With One Moonlit Night the narratives are almost contemporary in the early 1940s set mainly in Norfolk and partly in France.

“While the wife has gone to Norfolk to escape the war in London and is thrust into a strange house that is full of secrets she is in two senses of the word ‘searching’ for her husband.

“She is wondering what has happened to him because he has gone missing in France but she is also wondering about his life before she met him and specifically his childhood.

“I think people are fascinated by the idea of what their beloved spouse was like as a child.”

The inspiration came from the idea that you can marry somebody and never entirely know about your spouse especially from before you met them.

Launched at The Book Hive in Norwich on May 12 it is dedicated her mother and her aunt Anne who are twins and now 92.

“It was their wartime stories that suppose originally inspired as a child and interested me in that period” she explained.

Evoking scenes

Her 12th book it follows the success of The Silent Tide A Beautiful Spy and A Gathering Storm and research is now under way for a 13th novel which she reveals will be set in Cornwall with a narrative between the Second World War and 1966.

“There is always romance and they are quite traditional” she says of her books. “When I write the experience of evoking scenes is for me quite filmic as if I am seeing and hearing it all and experiencing it in the way that you do a dream.”

She regards her background as an editor in publishing as vitally important in shaping her approach.

“During my time as an editor I was completely immersed in the methodology of writing and the little tricks.

“I felt quite privileged to be so close to the writing process to be sitting next to Barbara Erskine going through the editing over a cup of tea at her kitchen table and saying ‘Barbara you really need a paragraph that explains such and such’ and she would write it while you were there and you would realise how the whole thing worked.

“It is a very personal relationship being an editor at that level.”

Literary culture

While in markedly different genres David and Rachel support each other professionally and often appear together at literary festivals such as Aldeburgh where they “interviewed” one another.

“I remember a few years ago the worst question a member of an audience asked was ‘are you jealous of each other’…which I thought was horrible - and no we aren’t.

“We are very comfortable with what each other does” explained Rachel who away from her writing enjoys singing with church choirs in Eaton and walking her fox red Labrador Zelda.

“I have to say local people have been very supportive of my books they sell very well in this area and I think Norwich is a great place to be an author because there is such a burgeoning literary culture which one feels part of.”

THERE is no doubt you can grab some great designer deals online but did you know that a typo could help you save hundreds of pounds on top brands?

An unfortunate spelling mistake on an eBay UK listing could be the difference between paying top dollar and bargain basement prices.

4 These misspelt Balenciaga trainers sold for £83

4 These misspelt Tiffany and Co sunglasses sold for £56 on eBay

But how much can you save? The Sun checked the auction website to find some examples.

We found a pair of used women’s Balenciaga Triple S clear sole trainers which have previously sold for £380 on eBay on June 20.

But a pair of identical misspelt “Balanciaga” trainers sold for just a fraction of the price at £83 on March 27.

They usually retail for £825. This means the buyer saved a whopping £297.

We also found a pair of Tiffany and Co sunglasses sold for £56 after attracting three bids.

They were listed under the name “Tifany and Co” and sold on April 18.



A similar pair with the correct spelling sold for £234 on June 19. That’s a difference of more than £182.

While a Vintage Fred Perry Harrington jacket which costs £250 new sold for just £40 with the spelling “Fred Pery”.

As well as checking all brand names are spelt correctly Emma Grant head of pre-loved at Ebay UK says pictures details and pricing are all important factors for sellers hoping to make their product stand out.

How to find misspelt bargains

There are specialist sites that can be used to trawl eBay for all possible spelling mistakes.

These include FatFinders bidkit and barginchecker.com.

Fred Perry has the most commonly misspelt listings with incorrectly spelt items accounting for more than 8% of all the brand’s listings according to Wholesale Clearance UK.

There were almost 9000 misspelt listings with the most common misspelt listing being ‘Red Perry’.

On average customers saved 20p on misspelt Fred Perry items.

Bigger savings come on brands such as Nike where a typo can help customers to save an average of £30.05.

Buyers looking for a deal on designer Rayban sunglasses could save an average of £26 by searching for Rayyan Ryan and Raban.

A typical listing on ‘Rayban’ sells for £45 but if you are savvy and search for a misspelling you can get an average price of £19.

Other brands commonly misspelt in listings include New Balance Puma and Harvey Nichols.

All misspellings for each brand were input into eBay’s own market research tool Terapeak to identify the average selling price and number of listings.

Beware of fakes

Shoppers need to watch out for fakes when buying on the likes of eBay.

As part of its rules eBay says it doesn’t allow counterfeit items to be listed.

To crack down on this eBay says all sellers should include original and clear photographs of their items.

Any items that do not follow the rules are either cancelled hidden or demoted.

Once he sold comfortable but slightly dowdy underwear to older ladies from a traditional lingerie shop in Llandudno. Now Dan Worsley is Ebay’s lingerie king the number one seller out of 11000 bra and knicker sellers on the online platform.

Online retail nearly killed his business then became its saviour. The first Covid lockdown threatened to wreck progress then super-charged it.

Now his firm Worsleywear is shifting more than 300000 items a year to customers who want brand-quality items at a fraction of High Street costs. Business is so good the firm recently moved to a new warehouse in Abergele where last week it opened a factory outlet-style shop.

This hopes Dan will become a “destination store” for the lingerie buyers of North Wales. “We’ve only been open a few days but already we’re getting repeat customers” said the 75-year-old. “People telling their friends because the prices are irresistible.”

The stock is unbranded but from factories in the Far East that supply the big chains and brands. Mostly end-of-run stock items their labels have been removed but concealing their origins is not always possible: on some items brand names are stitched into waistbands.

The new retail venture has returned Daniel to his roots his retail career going full circle to his brick-and-mortar beginnings. With wife Val in 1979 he opened his first lingerie shop in Macclesfield going on to open another two stores in Cheshire.

In 1996 they expanded to Llandudno. From St George’s Place via Mostyn Street they finally moved into a big old Victorian pile in Clonmel Street.

But trouble was brewing. High interest rates clobbered the business forcing the closure of Worsleywear's Cheshire shops. Then the shift to online retail hit turnover as did the changing practices of Llandudno’s hoteliers.

“They began offering coach trips for guests which took trade out of the town” said Dan. “They even started taking people to Tweedmill (a shopping outlet in Denbighshire) which was even worse.

“During the season you could still make decent money but in the off-season there were too few customers. You could fire a canon down Mostyn Street and not hit anyone.”

(Image: Ian Cooper/North Wales Live)

By 2008 Dan from Glan Conwy decided it was time to join the online revolution. A website was launched and an Ebay account created: the only thing missing were customers.

“The shop catered for shall we say older ladies” said Dan. “We had three floors and a cellar full of stock but they weren’t the kind of things wanted by younger online buyers.”

The last throw of the dice came in 2013. This time for the relaunch Dan bought in the right kind of stock mostly end-of-line items destined for a major high street chain. It was an inspired move: within two years online revenue was twice that of the Llandudno shop.

COMMENT: Still prefer buying in real-world shops rather thank taking a punt online? Have your say in the comments below.

Fixed to a 15-year lease Dan would dearly have loved to shut the shop there and then but couldn’t. In desperation he offered to pay £5000-a-year towards the lease if anyone was willing to take it on. They weren’t perhaps mindful the shop was losing even more.

So until 2016 it became a warehouse that sold the occasional lacy bra. Finally then Worsleywear was able to shed its shackles and move into a proper warehouse first in Conwy then Llandudno Junction.

Two important changes lay ahead. One was a decision to buy direct from the Far East using an agent to cut costs and offer ""rock bottom"" prices.

The other was the Covid pandemic. “In the first lockdown in 2020 everything came to a stop and we furloughed three staff” said Dan. “Within a month they were back at work again.

“Business just went ballistic. With people stuck at home everyone was buying online and we were providing what they wanted. Business more than doubled in lockdown. I hesitate to say it because of what happened during the pandemic but it was very good for our firm.”

Although the rate of growth has steadied since then turnover is still rising. Each month Worsleywear takes possession of a 40ft shipping container containing 30000 bras knickers leggings and other items – the business has expanded its offering to include nightwear swimwear skirts and beauty products. Even menswear.

Val remains a partner and Dan has been joined at the helm by stepson Marc Hatton who orchestrated the move to Tayna Business Park on Abergele’s High Street. “The Llandudno Junction warehouse was old with girders every 13ft in two directions limiting storage” said Dan.

“The new warehouse is more modern. We can accommodate as much stock using a third less space which we decided to use to create an outlet-style shop as there’s room for 20 cars to park outside.

“Essentially we are selling items you can find on the High Street but at much lower prices - £1 as opposed to £5 to £7. Bras that might cost £30 we are selling for £6.

“It’s taken off very quickly. I’m not aware of anyone else in the country with a similar business model.”

In April Dan made a 580-mile round trip to collect his hitchhiking cat Ashley from a residential garage in Essex. A similar determination to overcome adversity is now reaping rich dividends in his business life.

Worsley’s outlet shop is on Tanya Business Park High Street Abergele LL22 7AR. It’s open 9am-4pm Monday to Saturday.

New York CNN Business —

All things considered video game leader Electronic Arts is having a pretty decent year despite inflation worries recession fears and other macroeconomic headwinds. Shares of EA (EA) are only down about 2% in 2022 a drop that’s not nearly as bad as the rest of the tech sector which is now in bear market territory.

But there are concerns about EA’s future as the gaming industry consolidates.

Xbox owner Microsoft (MSFT) is in the process of buying Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Grand Theft Auto maker Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) has already scooped up mobile game developer Zynga.

Will EA be able to remain independent as its peers continue to grow? There’s also growing competition from the likes of metaverse mobile gaming company Roblox and Fortnite maker Epic. Even Netflix (NFLX) has thrown its hat into the gaming arena.

EA has a lot of lucrative franchises such as the long-running Madden NFL games a popular soccer series (that will soon lose the FIFA branding) Apex Legends and several games tied to the Star Wars universe.

And there has been a lot of chatter about EA being a good takeover target for deep-pocketed tech and media firms such as Apple (AAPL) Disney (DIS) Comcast (CMCSA) or Amazon (AMZN).

So will EA finally get bought? The company was not immediately available for comment.

But EA has been acquisitive in its own right and could be looking for further deals particularly ones that could bolster its mobile gaming division. EA made two such acquisitions in 2021 Glu for $2.4 billion and Playdemic (formerly owned by previous CNN parent AT&T (T)) for $1.4 billion.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that there’s about a 15% probability that EA could itself be acquired “given heightened levels of M&A activity within the video game space” according to a recent report about the broader tech sector. It’s a small chance to be sure but it’s bigger than zero.

The analysts came up with a potential takeover valuation of $190 a share which is “consistent with recent video game transactions.” That’s nearly 50% above EA’s current stock price.

Still EA has enough quality content to justify going it alone for the foreseeable future.

Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald noted in a report after EA’s latest earnings came out in May that a “solid pipeline” (more games from EA Sports plus updates to The Sims Lord of the Rings and Bioware franchises) as well as “accelerating mobile growth” were positives for the stock.

So EA may not need to sell itself to a larger company to remain competitive in the video game world.

Earnings from Nike and Walgreens on tap

There is a definite lull in “earnings season.” Most major companies will report second quarter results in mid-July. But some notable companies including two Dow components are on tap to release results this week.

Nike (NKE) will report its earnings after the closing bell Monday. Shares of the sneaker and athletic apparel giant are down nearly 35% this year.

The company reported solid results in March but geopolitical worries have weighed on Nike’s stock. Analysts are predicting that Nike will post a decline in sales and earnings per share for the quarter. Nike also just announced it’s exiting Russia in light of the invasion of Ukraine.

Walgreens (WBA) will also report results before the market opens on Thursday. Shares are down 20% this year double the 10% drop for rival CVS (CVS) but not as bad as the nearly 45% plunge for Rite Aid (RAD).

It’s been a challenging second year for Walgreens CEO Rosalind Brewer who took the top job in March 2021.

The veteran executive who had previous leadership roles at Walmart (WMT) and Starbucks (SBUX) is dealing with supply chain disruptions and concerns about a slowdown in the economy and weakening consumer demand — a problem facing all retailers. Wall Street is predicting that revenue and net income will fall from a year ago.

No one and that is why EA and Criterion games are allegedly bringing a new multiplayer experience for gamers of the famous racing game franchise with the new title ""Need for Speed: Unbound"" coming soon for the world.

The reports regarding the new multiplayer experience in the new game are like the metaverse where people can ride their cars and stroll around the locations on the map.

'Need for Speed: Unbound' New Multiplayer Experience

ComicBook Gaming said there are new rumors about the upcoming racing game that would continue the franchise from EA and Criterion and it would be under the new title ""Need for Speed: Unbound."" The game may be featuring new cars and experiences along with maps and new modes for people to race in but that is not its most significant change to the game.

""Unbound"" is set to deliver a new multiplayer experience for people to enjoy. It aims to give people a unique chance to ride around in their cars with friends and experience the nightlife car scene. The leak came from Tom Henderson (via Exputer) and the insider said that EA and Criterion focused on a new immersive experience in the multiplayer.

'NFS Unbound's Multiplayer is Like the Metaverse

Multiplayer experiences in the ""Need for Speed"" franchise were available before but it focuses on bringing people into one match to compete against each other and ride like there is no tomorrow. However EA and Criterion are set to make significant changes for ""NFS Unbound"" including anime-themed special effects and a somewhat metaverse for its multiplayer.

In the metaverse people get to live their life the way they want and be the boss of their world while connecting with other users. ""NFS Unbound"" aims to do the same by connecting them with friends to drive around its maps with their beloved cars.

'Need for Speed' and EA's Release

Electronic Arts are in a somewhat ditch now and it is because the company is aiming to bring its operations somewhere else with many talks about a merger with massive companies emerging in the past weeks. One report talked about its meetings with Apple and Disney offering the entertainment company and its titles for acquisition.

The company also recently ended its partnership with the FIFA league and its brand effectively bringing news that it will cease to develop the famous soccer game that is long-running on its franchise. The many changes in EA made people fear what would happen next especially to its games that were a part of regular releases up to the present.

""Need for Speed"" is one of the world's longest-running racing franchises. It brings many famous vehicles that users may modify and create to their liking expanding their experiences with a virtual title. While others use the game for inspiration for their project cars others focus on it here; they may get to own and enjoy riding in it with the new multiplayer experience.

Sources speaking with Try Hard's Tom Henderson have said EA is ready to give the world a look at the next entry in the series.

The game is reportedly just called Skate and is further along in development than previously thought when leaked footage surfaced back in April. Apparently the leaked footage showed a game very early in development and quite a few months old at that.

Skate 4 which is what we're calling it for now was announced as in early development during the EA Play Live 2020 showcase by franchise director Deran Chung and creative director Chris Parry who said that fans of the series had commented it ""into existence.""

The following January EA formed Vancouver-based studio Full Circle stating it would be working on Skate 4. The studio is under the leadership of Daniel McCulloch the former head of Xbox Live at Microsoft.

While next to nothing is known about the game EA hinted during a June 2020 call to investors Skate 4 could contain an open-world with “user-generated content and interaction.”

The last game in the series Skate 3 was released in May 2010 and came with features new to the series such as a park builder and a choice of difficulty modes.

If you are into skating games and need something to hold you over until Skate 4 is released give the incredible OlliOlli World a try."

BuzzFeed

1. First The Boys gave us the chaotic and hilarious ""Herogasm"" and it was...yup a lot. After busting into Herogasm Soldier Boy  Butcher and Hughie tried to take down Homelander once and for all during an epic fight that I would like to talk about for the foreseeable future.

Prime Video

2. Also on The Boys Hughie and Annie had this heartbreaking conversation where Hughie revealed that he's hated feeling like a lesser person next to Annie's superhero powers. The episode ultimately ended with Annie livestreaming the aftermath of ""Herogasm"" and telling the world how awful most heroes are.

Prime Video

3. Legacies ended after four seasons thus ending The Vampire Diaries universe after 13 years. The finale featured a lot of goodbyes and changes but I really need to talk about Alaric deciding to leave the Salvatore School so Caroline Forbes returned to take over as headmaster.

The CW

4. Also on the Legacies series finale Hope got to watch a special message from her father Klaus Mikaelson and she was able to hear how much he loved her. Honestly it was so great to see Joseph Morgan AND Candice King back in the TVD universe one last time.

The CW

5. The Umbrella Academy finally returned with Season 3 on Netflix. The new season picked up right after the Season 2 finale with the Hargreeves children returning to their time period only to find out a lot has changed. Namely their house is now inhabited by the Sparrow Academy. The first episode featured a dance battle between The Umbrella and Sparrow Academies and it was pretty iconic.

Netflix

6. The Umbrella Academy Also on Elliot Page's real-life transition was beautifully incorporated into the series when Viktor came out as trans. The storyline was perfectly written and I definitely got emotional seeing Viktor's siblings supporting him.

Netflix

7. Obi-Wan Kenobi came to an end this week. The epic conclusion found Obi-Wan and Darth Vader coming face to face as Obi-Wan had to say goodbye to Anakin once again. This really marked the end of Anakin and truly the beginning of Darth Vader and it was so emotional and SO well done.

Lucasfilm / Disney+

8. The Summer I Turned Pretty started streaming on Prime Video and I can confidently say I haven't thought about anything else. Based on Jenny Han's books the series follows Belly whose favorite time of the year is the summer because it means spending time with Conrad and Jeremiah Fisher at her favorite place in the world Cousins Beach.

Prime Video

9. And on The Summer I Turned Pretty while I will be swooning over Conrad Fisher all summer I need to point out the heartbreaking ending to Season 1 when everyone found out Susannah's cancer is back. Like I read the books fully knew this was coming but still sobbed. Also the use of Phoebe Bridgers' ""Funeral"" just added to the feelings.

Prime Video

10. Ms. Marvel Kamala found out more about her family's connection to the bangle when Kamran's mom explained that they are Clandestines and are from the Noor Dimension. Of course by the time the episode ended Kamran's mom ended up hunting Kamala and turning into the villain so there's that.

11. On The Flash ummmmm...I can't even do the scene justice by describing it but basically Eobard legit ripped open — like tore open — his head to reveal Tom Cavanagh's Eobard underneath. It's a moment ripped (lol) right from The Flash comics and it was wild. Also Iris seemingly died?! So that's not great.

A small tweak to your job title could save you money every month on car insurance,"'Artist' or 'illustrator'? A small tweak to your job title could save you money every month on car insurance

While no kid dreams of becoming a doctor or firefighter just to save on car insurance that is a real perk that comes with some professions.

That’s because many insurance companies take your occupation into account when deciding your rates even down to your specific job title.

How useful is that information? After all no one's going to change careers to shave a few bucks off their premiums.

Well the next time you're shopping for car insurance try out a couple variations of your existing job title. The results might surprise you — and maybe even give you a little extra confidence in your choice of career.

Don’t miss

Too many Americans are still missing out on cheaper car insurance

Your cash is trash: Here are 4 simple ways to protect your money against white-hot inflation (without being a stock market genius)

How to turn your spare change into a diversified portfolio

Why take your career into account?

Each insurance company has its own proprietary algorithm it uses to set premiums and they each keep their formulas a closely guarded secret.

In the U.K. you can easily find tools online that show how your rate changes based on your job title — say from news reporter to journalist or writer.

Michael DeLong a research and advocacy associate at the Consumer Federation of America says he isn’t aware of a similar tool stateside but that doesn't mean insurers aren’t looking at that information and adjusting their rates accordingly.

DeLong says your job and title can be relevant for insurance companies looking to determine how much you drive and at what time of day.

“Miles driven is the most accurate measure of how likely you are to get into an accident so that makes a certain amount of sense” he says. “But what we found is that someone's job can actually impact their auto insurance premium even in cases where it wouldn't seem to automatically follow.”

Occupation and title can also go a long way in telling a company what the culture is like at your workplace and how that might affect your driving.

Some jobs carry a stereotype of social drinking or partying says Emily Leff research content lead at Insurify.

“Bartenders for example [are] more associated with social drinking obviously” she says. “And also the hours … [those] kind of non-traditional hours late at night you could more likely get into accidents during times like that.”

Using your job is banned in some states

Insurance companies can take a lot of factors into consideration from your gender to your zip code and how each factor gets weighted varies.

“Different companies have their own unique formula when it comes to setting rates” Leff says. “It also depends what state you're in.”

Story continues

For a long time advocates have been arguing that your education and occupation shouldn’t have any bearing on your insurance rates.

Several states have even banned the practice including California Massachusetts Hawaii Georgia New York and Michigan.

Nevertheless a Consumer Reports study from 2021 shows that your occupation can have a significant impact on your rate depending on the insurer.

With some providers it found significant discrepancies between what lower earners and higher earners actually paid for their insurance over the year.

For example Geico quoted applicants in typically lower-paying jobs an average of nearly $100 more a year than people who had jobs that pay higher wages.

Farmers Insurance also asks for your occupation when you’re filling out a quote but it didn’t have much impact on the premium price according to Consumer Reports.

“We think that basically when your title changes in those ways that auto insurers are trying to use it to have sort of a rough proxy for wealth” says DeLong.

The logic could be that customers with higher-paying jobs can afford to bundle insurance taking on life or home or renters insurance he says. So the company may be more apt to provide them with a lower rate when it comes to their car insurance as a sort of incentive to buy more.

But it’s hard to say exactly what impact a specific job title has says Leff as there isn’t much publicly available data on it.

See for yourself

The best way to find out is to try it yourself.

Moneywise did its own unscientific poll checking quotes from several of the biggest auto insurance companies in the U.S.

Some including All State Liberty Mutual Nationwide and Travelers Insurance didn’t ask for an occupation for a preliminary quote. Farmers Insurance made it optional for discounts and only certain occupations qualified.

But both Progressive and Geico required a job title be submitted for a quote.

Keeping all the personal geographic and driving habits details the same a driver in her 30s with a 2013 Volkswagen Jetta got varying rates when the only information that changed was her job title.

Progressive’s monthly quotes were:

Journalist: $58.50

Reporter: $50.97

Writer: $57.65

And with the same titles Geico’s six-month premiums were:

Journalist: $1012.50

Reporter: $1012.50

Writer: $1153.18

Keep in mind these rates aren’t finalized. Preliminary online quotes can differ from the actual premium price and an insurance company may gather more information from you before finalizing a rate.

Additionally the Consumer Reports researchers acknowledge that there may be other factors “not visible to this study” that influence pricing. Multiple insurers they looked at had notes in their small print that their price quotes rely on “assumptions” made based on the information consumers provide.

Don't push it too far

DeLong at the Consumer Federation of America advises that honesty is the best policy when it comes to insurance.

Not only can lying result in losing your insurance using a title that doesn’t accurately describe what you do to get a better insurance rate can be considered fraud.

“You should be absolutely truthful when filling out the information for an insurance quote because if you don't you can be held liable” he says.

He adds it can help to emphasize that you are a cautious and careful person. But ultimately DeLong says the best way to get a good rate is to shop around.

“It's well worth taking your time to spend an hour or two and look around for a better deal.”

While these jerseys are not used in any official game they often highlight certain lesser- known details of the club’s history or play homage to some iconic kits.

According to reports from Footy Headlines Adidas are set to unveil a retro Real Madrid jersey in 2023. The kit is said to be inspired from the 1990s and attempt to recreate the iconic jersey worn by the team between 1998 and 2000.

At that time it was the first Real Madrid kit designed by Adidas after they replaced Kelme.

The front of the jersey is largely white with Navy Blue stripes on the sleeves and the collar. It also boasts of bold Navy-Orange-Navy EQT stripes on both sides to add a sparkle to the piece.

The centre of the shirt features the logo of the club and an Adidas logo right above the crest. It is a tribute to the EQT era in which Adidas could not release a kit for Los Blancos.

The kit is rumoured to be available by late December or early January and will retail for about €90 Euros. While the team will not wear it in an official match it could be a staple pre-match jersey in the latter half of the season.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Poorly trained staff chaotic management and a series of incidents that left children’s safety in danger were cited in official reports by Ofsted which inspects children’s homes as it concluded they were providing inadequate care. Several have closed since inspectors raised concerns.

The Observer examined the most recent Ofsted inspection of private children’s care homes. It found that 114 homes were given the lowest “inadequate” rating which triggers further investigations. Of those about 20 were run by providers with links to private equity. It comes amid continued frustration with the “broken” provision of children’s care homes.

Private firms now play a large role in providing care with more than three-quarters of homes in England run by the sector in 2021. Local government figures have also pointed to the growing role of private equity warning that the pursuit of profits and debt that can follow is not a sound basis upon which to run care homes.

Anntoinette Bramble chair of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board said: “The Competition and Markets Authority has confirmed our own findings that private equity providers are making extremely high profits and carrying concerning levels of debt that risks the stability of homes for children in care which is paramount if they are to thrive.”

Graphite Capital which has a stake in the Hawksmoor restaurant chain currently has a stake in three companies which managed six homes with inadequate ratings. All have closed since their inspection two before Graphite took a stake in the relevant company.

At one of the properties run by Compass Children’s Homes a staff member failed to share a plan about a “significant visit” for a child and his brothers and sisters. “As a result the child missed out on seeing all of his brothers and sisters together before some moved on to adoption” inspectors found. Their report said that shortfalls “compromise children’s physical and emotional health”.

At another run by a provider in the Horizon Care group inspectors found children living in a “hazardous environment” which triggered an environmental health investigation. They found that when a child told staff she had self-harmed “staff did not ask more about this nor did they find out if the child needed medical attention”. Horizon has public contracts with two councils worth £1m million according to Tussell which tracks public contracts.

A spokeswoman for Graphite Capital said its ownership had no bearing on the decision to close any of the homes. She said Compass and Horizon had above average Ofsted ratings among all the homes they ran and “substantially exceed industry norms” with Graphite investment allowing companies to improve their homes.

Aspris which is partly owned by Waterland Private Equity has two homes with significant failings which received the lowest possible rating from Ofsted while a third inadequate home has closed. At one of the homes run by Progress Care and Education Ltd inspectors found that one child was physically prevented from leaving his bedroom but “records of this incident did not demonstrate that this restraint was necessary or proportionate”. It adds: “Furthermore the continuity of children’s care has been significantly affected by a high use of agency staff and high numbers of staff absences. For example in one week in March 2022 15 different agency members worked at the home.”

A spokesperson for Aspris said: “We currently have two residential children’s homes rated as ‘inadequate’ a figure which will reduce to one shortly following a recent re-inspection. By comparison nine of our homes are currently rated as ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted. We have complete confidence that the standard of service provided to those in our care is unaffected by our ownership arrangements.”

Ardenton Capital has a stake in companies that run two inadequate homes. In one run by Radical Services Ltd inspectors stated: “The garden is littered with cigarette butts and rubbish waiting to be taken to the tip and is overgrown and uncared for. Interior decoration is not of a high standard particularly in the child’s bedroom.” The home whose ultimate owner is now Pebbles is closed after discussions with Ofsted. Michael Walsh chief executive of Pebbles said: “Our owner Ardenton has always said and continues to say ‘what do we need to do to be better at providing the care the children need?’. As long as investors have this long-term approach with children at the heart of everything then I think there is a place for this type of owner in our sector.”

Josh MacAlister who chaired a government-backed independent review of children’s social care called for a “whole system reset” to create regional bodies to oversee and build the children’s homes that are needed. “Children’s homes provide a safe harbour for some of our most vulnerable children and many of the staff who work in these homes go above and beyond” he said. “However the review found that the ‘market’ of care for children is broken. Profiteering children being moved far from their communities and a shortage of homes that meet children’s needs are all urgent problems which need fixing.”

A spokeswoman for Graphite Capital said private provision generally costs local authorities no more than they would be paying for in-house residential care. “Without the private sector investing in new capacity there would be nowhere for children and young people requiring residential care to go.”

Brian Milner is a former senior economics writer and global markets columnist for The Globe and Mail.

Rising borrowing costs dimming economic prospects and stricter lending rules are taking some of the air out of housing bubbles in Canada the United States and other markets in which strong demand tight supply and speculative fever have driven prices to record levels and deepened an already serious affordability crisis.

The evidence that overheated markets are cooling is mounting. Canadian home resales slid 8.6 per cent in May from the previous month and much more than that in such hot markets as Vancouver. Prices fell for a second consecutive month after shooting higher through most of the COVID-19 pandemic and some economists forecast a decline of up to 20 per cent this year as higher mortgage rates hit home.

Restoring a modicum of sanity to residential markets won’t do much for people seeking accommodation they can afford. But at least it will prevent the crisis from getting even worse right? Well not really.

Institutional investors which have squeezed residential markets in many parts of the world can be expected to pick up a purchasing pace that has turned them into the world’s biggest private landlords and transformed rental housing into a go-to global asset class.

“Institutional ownership threatens to accelerate the trends unleashed by the financialization of housing” says a report commissioned by the Greens group in the European Parliament to buttress their case for a regional response to the crisis. “Deeper financial markets have not substantively increased either aggregate home ownership or housing supply but instead have inflated house prices and pulled down rental yields.”

In Canada the big institutional money has largely stuck with apartment buildings in major cities. But across the U.S. Britain and elsewhere in Europe private equity firms Wall Street investment banks sovereign wealth funds insurers major pension funds (including the investment arm of the Canada Pension Plan) and their real estate partners and affiliates have been loading up on single-family homes.

The institutional crowd used to steer clear of this fragmented market that typically attracted small-scale mom-and-pop investors. But automated digital platforms have made it easier and cheaper to track price acquire and manage large swaths of homes in multiple communities. As they snap up properties these bulk-buying acquisitors have helped drive up sales prices and rental costs skewed development and in some cases exacerbated housing insecurity.

Defending a federal budget measure that calls for a two-year ban on home purchases by foreigners Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared that houses “aren’t supposed to be assets for wealthy investors. They are supposed to be homes where families can raise their kids and create neighbourhoods and communities.”

It’s a fine sentiment. But the fact is that investors will keep knocking on Canadian doors. Foreign capital can easily team up with Canadian partners and domestic investors routinely outbid house-hunting families. The attraction? The prospect of steady returns long-term price appreciation and inflation protection – rent hikes far outstrip cost of living increases – at a time when rising volatility soaring public debt and heightened geopolitical risk are clouding the outlook for stocks bonds and other investments.

The financial heavyweights’ move into housing has been aided and abetted by governments through financial deregulation tax breaks subsidies for home owners historically low borrowing costs and relief for renters which translates into stable income for investors.

Years of loose monetary policy “contributed to making government bonds less and less attractive and housing finance more and more accessible shifting investments into the real estate markets and creating house price bubbles which increased housing unaffordability” says Sebastian Kohl a sociology professor at Berlin’s Free University and co-author of the European report titled My Home is an Asset Class.

“On one hand we say housing is a human right. But we see more and more resources allocated to supporting home ownership and private rental” says Yushu Zhu an assistant professor of urban studies and public policy at Simon Fraser University who has researched housing inequality and the impact of turning the sector into “an investment opportunity.”

The crisis has triggered a growing public backlash to the power of the investors as angry residents demand government action ranging from rent controls and stiffer sanctions to more drastic intervention.

In Berlin institutional investors have gobbled up €40-billion (about $54.8-billion) worth of rental homes double the combined value of what they own in London and Amsterdam their next largest European markets. A majority of Berliners voted in a referendum last September to expropriate holdings of landlords with 3000 or more apartments. A commission is currently investigating whether such a law would be constitutional.

People are fighting the investment tide in other markets too with varying degrees of success. In the Netherlands the government has given municipal authorities the right to block companies from buying homes in lower-income districts and turning them into rentals. This comes after more than one-third of the properties sold in the country’s four largest cities in 2020 ended up in the hands of investors.

In the U.S. some communities have adopted rules to make corporate or investor purchases of single-family houses less attractive. A homeowners’ association in Charlotte N.C. passed an ordinance in 2019 forcing buyers to wait two years before renting out their houses. Others have imposed similar impediments which have occasionally slowed but not halted the investor-led shopping spree.

The largest and most experienced institutional player in the residential game is Blackstone Group a global investing powerhouse with US$550-billion worth of property holdings running the gamut from office buildings hotels housing and retail complexes to industrial space warehouses data centres and research facilities.

Blackstone last month opened its first real estate office in Toronto to expand its already substantial presence in this country where it holds $14-billion worth of property mainly in the logistics sector but also commercial and residential buildings in Montreal Toronto and Vancouver.

The asset manager has spent billions acquiring housing in the U.S. and other markets from Britain to China. Responding to criticism of its aggressive expansion Blackstone points out that its funds own less than 1 per cent of rental housing in the U.S. and other markets where it operates. In a company statement it said “Given our ownership levels we have virtually no ability to impact market rent trends. Rents are going up because there is significantly less supply of housing across the globe than demand for it.”

It’s true that Blackstone Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Tricon Residential Inc. and the rest of the institutional buyers club combined account for no more than about 2 per cent of rental stock in any country. But that amounts to about 300000 single-family houses in the U.S. alone largely concentrated in certain districts of fast-growing cities and surrounding suburbs many of them in the lightly regulated sunbelt states.

Institutional investors’ “domination of some local housing markets gives them the power to increase rents and dictate lease terms” Suzanne Lanyi Charles an associate professor of urban planning at Cornell University wrote last month in The Hill a Washington political website. She noted that “where their rentals are highly concentrated mega-landlords have outsized power over the lives of residents. They can undermine renters’ access to those neighbourhoods as well as housing affordability and stability.”

The biggest American operator Invitation Homes Inc. a publicly traded company worth about US$23-billion created by Blackstone jacked up rents last year by 18 per cent for new leases 8 per cent for renewals and almost 30 per cent in such booming U.S. markets as Las Vegas she said.

Blackstone began crafting its single-family investment strategy in the U.S. a decade ago when the market was still reeling from the 2008 financial meltdown and ensuing Great Recession. In the immediate aftermath of the housing collapse Blackstone and other specialists in distressed assets loaded up on cheap foreclosed properties and later flipped them for quick profits.

But Blackstone and a handful of other players subsequently adopted a model in which large-scale holdings would be converted to rentals producing a steady stream of income. Persistent housing shortages – nearly 30 U.S. states report deficits – ensured that demand would support higher rents even in a flagging economy.

The single-family rental game has since grown so profitable that developers want to play too. Imagine a house-seeking family trying to compete with the likes of Core Development Group a Toronto-based condo builder that unveiled plans last year to spend as much as $1-billion acquiring detached homes in various mid-sized cities.

In the U.S. home builder Lennar Corp. teamed up last year with the real estate subsidiary of German insurer Allianz and other institutional investors in a venture to buy more than US$4-billion worth of new houses and hang “for lease” signs on them. Another developer put its entire 124-house subdivision in a Houston suburb on the rental market and then sold it all last year to Fundrise an online property investment platform that manages in excess of US$1-billion for more than 260000 small investors.

None of these investments will do anything to address the acute lack of affordable housing. And neither will some of the enacted or proposed restrictions aimed at reining in the money crowd including foreign ownership bans steeper property taxes rent caps limits on evictions or even full disclosure of who owns what.

Interventions in the marketplace need to do more than improve conditions for home buyers and renters. They have to persuade the major financial players that it’s in their interests to earmark a chunk of their investors’ capital for the construction of more affordable housing – as a few funds are doing profitably.

“The idea is not to keep institutional investors and their huge savings glut from entering the housing sector but to regulate it properly” Prof. Kohl of Free University says.

At the same time policy makers dealing not only with the current crisis but challenges posed by reurbanization and the effects of climate change ought to consider dusting off some of the successful instruments developed in the aftermath of two world wars. These created “a veritable housing production machine under state orchestration that overcame the pent-up demand and … housing shortages within about two decades” Prof. Kohl says.

One way to get that machine in gear would be for governments to put non-profit housing providers on a stronger competitive footing with private developers. It would also be “a more strategic long-term way to deter this financialization” Ms. Zhu of Simon Fraser argues.

In Europe non-profit housing accounts for as much as 20 per cent of the supply in certain markets and in some cases even more. In Vienna a social-housing pioneer a majority of renters live in municipally owned residences or subsidized non-profit co-operatives.

In Canada social housing accounts for just 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the entire rental market Ms. Zhu says. “Social housing providers are totally siloed. They cannot compete with the private market developers and they receive only very limited support from government.”

That situation isn’t going to change any time soon at least not as long as housing remains too lucrative an asset for institutional investors to ignore.

(NASDAQ:ETSY) Worth Looking At Closely?,"Let's talk about the popular Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Etsy’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

See our latest analysis for Etsy

What's the opportunity in Etsy?

Etsy appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 24.39x is currently well-above the industry average of 15.03x meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Etsy’s share price is quite volatile this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

Can we expect growth from Etsy?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Etsy's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 71% indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What this means for you:

Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ETSY’s positive outlook with shares trading above industry price multiples. However this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ETSY should trade below its current price selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ETSY for some time now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for ETSY which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. For example - Etsy has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

Wedding outfits can be expensive but one bride found a way to bring her dream look to life without going over budget.

Julia who requested that Insider publish her first name only for privacy reasons had her eyes set on the Galia Lahav ""Fabianna"" dress when planning what to wear for her June wedding reception. However she couldn't justify the $7000 price tag.

Instead Julia decided to make her own version of the gown using a $68 bodysuit from Kim Kardashian's SKIMS line as well as some lace fabric that she purchased off Etsy.

According to a SKIMS representative the bodysuit which debuted in 2020 has been discontinued. The SKIMS Sheer Sculpt bodysuit is meant to be similar the representative told Insider.

""As I was hand-sewing each piece of lace onto the bodysuit I thought there was no way it would hold up but I was so happy it did"" Julia said.

Julia used the rest of the lace fabric to make the skirt and the straps and then she used an old bra hook for the closure of the skirt. She said the dress cost $1300 to make and took her about four days to complete.

In May Julia shared a TikTok video showing the process of making her reception dress. It had over 701000 views as of Saturday. Because she didn't have a mannequin she said she used a weight plate to re-create her measurements so the dress was made to fit her exact body shape.

But this year a new ocean-based theme is emerging as the home decor trend to know about: ‘crustaceancore’. A trend where all things crustacean - think lobsters crabs and shrimp - are appearing on our homeware items.

The rise of crustaceancore interiors

Oliver Bonas has reported seeing an 1340% increase in searches for crustacean themed products since March 2022 and the trend can be spotted at other retailers too. At Etsy there has been a 112% increase in searches for lobster prints in the last three months and a 31% increase in searches for oyster art.

The White Stuff have recently launched some utterly adorable crustaceancore items too including a brilliant ‘You are my lobster’ tea towel and a crab wall hook. Anthropologie have also released sea-themed homeware products including a stunning lobster platter that wouldn’t look out of place on your summer dinner table.

So what is it about the trend that we love so much - and why is it taking off?

Experts reckon that the crustaceancore theme plays nicely on our feelings of nostalgia. Dayna Isom Johnson trend expert at Etsy explains 'Reminiscent of seaside memories the crustacean trend is becoming a mainstay amongst shoppers this summer.'

It’s also just fun and colourful - and who doesn’t need an injection of that after the last two years? 'We like to think of it as coastal grandma’s bolder brighter younger sister. It allows shoppers to add pops of personality to their homes with everything from colourful crabs to prawn prints' Dayna said.

Plus it perfectly pairs with almost any home decor style be it 'minimalism maximalism or anything in between - making it easy to incorporate into any space' Danya said.

How to incorporate crustaceancore into your home

So how can you add the trend to your home? Don’t worry - you don’t have to go full crustacean!

Dayna told us 'A simple and inexpensive way to introduce crustaceancore into your home is to incorporate lobster or shrimp wall art crustacean-themed accent pillows or shell-shaped vases and serving ware.'

By adding it in small ways you won’t feel overwhelmed by the slightly out-there trend - and can instead embrace it in an easy way that suits your existing decor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdmVudHJ5dGVsZWdyYXBoLm5ldC9tdW0tcXVvdGVkLThrLWtpdGNoZW4tbWFrZW92ZXItMjQzMTMzMzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mum quoted £8k for kitchen makeover goes DIY and does it for £350,"Our free email updates are the best way to get headlines direct to your inbox

A mum revealed how she gave her old-fashioned kitchen a chic makeover for just £350 after being quoted £8000 and said it inspired her to do more DIY. Stephanie McCormick 33 was quoted thousands of pounds for a new kitchen but decided to do the renovation herself with products bought from the high street.

Mum-of-two Stephanie from Clovenfords Scottish Borders bought the three-bedroom bungalow with her partner in October last year. But she said it needed a spruce and she wanted to stamp her own style on it so decided to do the work herself.

In just two weeks she transformed the kitchen into a modern space with sleek copper geometric shapes and charcoal grey cupboards – for £350. Stephanie who works as a complex needs assistant sanded and painted 23 cupboard doors scrubbed her floor tiles and painted her walls.

She accessorised by hanging bright copper utensils over the hob and trailing plants around the room. Stephanie said: “The house was in good order and it had been well maintained by the previous owners.

""But we wanted to put our own stamp on it. It hadn’t been updated since it was built 15 years ago and was of the older generation so it needed dragged into this year and given a bit of a spruce.

“I have always been a keen crafter and pretty creative so I thought I could give it a go myself. There was no way we could have afford £8000 for a new kitchen we just didn’t have that sort of money lying around.

“I wanted to go for an industrial chic look with a warehouse feel which is why we went for the copper – that was the inspiration. I took all 23 doors off in the kitchen and numbered them so we knew exactly where they would fit back.

“I scrubbed all the old grease and marks off them and then sanded everything down before I started painting. I used Frenchic Paint which was lovely to work with.

“I applied it with a brush rather than a roller - it doesn’t need any finishes and it’s waterproof. The paint has held so well I thought I would have to be touching it up all the time but I haven’t.

“I got the accessories from Dunelm Ikea The Range and Studio. I painted the geometric planters the same colour to fit in with the units.”

And after seeing how well it turned it Stephanie was spurred on to renovate her bathroom – which she did in just four days for less than £400. She got a new floor for £160 and bought accessories from Matalan and Etsy to finish off the space.

Stephanie now has plans to tackle the hallway next which she hopes to panel. She said: “I got inspired to do our bathroom after seeing how well the kitchen turned out.

“There was nothing wrong with the suit and I didn’t see any sense in spending money on a new one and putting perfectly good stuff to landfill. We did it in four days over a long weekend and the whole room cost less than £400.

“The floors were changed to a textile backed vinyl which only cost £160 to buy and fit. I got some new units from Argos and used paint from Dunelm which was only £13 for 2.5l tub – it was amazing and gave great coverage.

“I hung shelves from Matalan that I got in the sale and some wall art from Etsy. The matt black finishes like the toilet roll holder and the towel rail were from B&Q.

“I tried to embrace the dark moodiness of the room. It has inspired me to do the rest of the house seeing how well those two rooms have turned out really spurred me on.

“I am hoping to do the hallway next with some panelling.”"

(Getty)

KANSAS CITY Mo. (WDAF) — It is officially summer which means the hot temperatures are officially here too.

Power companies are asking people to conserve energy when possible during the heat wave. It will help utilities keep up with demand and also help keep bills as low as possible.

Evergy a Kansas-based utility company suggests customers utilize ceiling fans as much as possible. The fan will help circulate cooler air while providing your A/C with a little bit of a break.

But do you know which way your fan blades should rotate during the summer?

Evergy said to make sure ceiling fan blades are rotating in a counter-clockwise direction. The motion will circulate the cool air during the summer.

During the winter you’ll want to switch directions and have your fan blades rotate clockwise. That will help spread the warm air throughout your house or apartment.

Much of the U.S. was blanketed by a heat dome earlier this week sending temperatures into the 90s and 100s for many.

Amid the widespread heat residents in a number of states have already been warned that they could be impacted by power blackouts.",,,,,,,,,,,,

By Ronni Newton

Eversource announced Thursday that a new data-driven approach to vegetation management has been launched in 13 communities throughout the state looking to improve electrical resiliency in the areas that are traditionally hardest hit with storm-related outages.

Based on analysis of 10 years of outage data West Hartford is among the 13 communities with a vulnerable circuit specifically a 0.3-mile segment in the Lockwood Terrace area located just north of Park Road in the eastern end of town.

The program which is a collaborative approach between Eversource arborists towns and property owners will focus on the planting of “appropriate utility-compatible trees” as well as pollinator plants in place of existing trees in the “fall zone” to help strengthen the grid by preventing limbs or entire trees from falling onto the wires. According to Eversource 90% of outages that occur during storms are the result of tree damage and severe weather has become more commonplace.

“We’ve already met with the town and we plan to go door-to-door and work directly with about 50 customers to get the tree work done” Kate Rayner an Eversource spokesperson said of the forthcoming work in the Lockwood Terrace area. “The critical device – a fuse has had three outages caused by trees in the past five years totaling more than 1 million minutes of outage time for West Hartford residents.”

Statewide there are 15 segments in 13 communities that have been identified. In addition to West Hartford the other communities involved in the program include Chester Clinton Guilford Mansfield Middletown Naugatuck Newtown Redding Sharon Windham and Woodstock.

“Our goal is to find a collaborative solution with our customers and communities that has the potential to significantly reduce tree-related outages during storms” Eversource Vice President of Operation Services Steve Driscoll said in a statement. “We have the data that shows how and where trees are impacting service to our customers and we’re looking to develop new ways to turn the worst performing lines into the most reliable circuits in our state while planting appropriate trees to maintain the state’s character.”

According to Eversource the total length of the segments is approximately 20 miles – “a relatively small area in comparison to the roughly 4000 miles the energy company trims across the state each year and more than 16000 miles on the system” but will protect the infrastructure for more than 8200 customers as well as public safety and other critical facilities.

The program has already launched in Redding.

“Connecticut has a tree problem” Driscoll said. “Drought invasive insects and overall age are taking a toll on the state’s trees. We’d like to do something about it and at the same time improve reliability for our customers. Our goal is to collaborate with the communities and customers to educate them on the tree risks and the tree work that can have a positive impact on day-to-day reliability and resiliency during storms.”

The package was composed entirely of an enormous stock grant tied to the company’s performance. As Tesla has sold enough electric vehicles to become the most valuable automaker on the planet Mr. Musk has so far received shares worth nearly $60 billion now — helping to make him the world’s richest person.

Compensation experts say they see the influence of Mr. Musk’s deal everywhere.

“There’s a lot of companies out there that saw that award and its structure” said Brian Johnson executive director with ISS Corporate Solutions which advises businesses on executive pay and other practices. “They think it’s a good way to incentivize performance.”

A new survey conducted by Equilar a compensation consulting firm for The New York Times shows that many of last year’s highest-paid executives got packages that like Mr. Musk’s could pay out the sort of sums that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. And even as the gap between what executives and workers earn continued to widen during the pandemic companies opened the floodgates for what they paid their leaders in 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The oil giant is predicting that by 2040 every new passenger car sold in the world will be electric CEO Darren Woods told CNBC's David Faber in an interview. In 2021 just 9% of all passenger car sales were electric vehicles including plug-in hybrids according to market research company Canalys. That number is up 109% from 2020 says Canalys.

In light of its modeling Woods said Exxon Mobil is evaluating how the decline in gasoline sales could impact its business. Exxon Mobil is one of the largest publicly traded international gas companies and a leader in the industry. Its website boasts that it is the largest ""refiner and marketer of petroleum products"" as well as a chemicals company.

Woods who spent a part of his career on the chemical side of the company's operations says chemicals will be key to keeping the company profitable during the clean energy transition. The plastics that Exxon Mobil produces can be used in the manufacturing of electric vehicles.

ExxonMobil's calculations predicted that oil demand in 2040 would be equivalent to what the world needed in 2013 or 2014. Woods explained to CNBC that the company was still profitable at that time.

Woods seemed unfazed by the prediction saying ""that change will not make or break this business or this industry quite frankly.""

The reality however couldn’t be more different. ExxonMobil’s CEO tells us why the transition to zero-emission vehicles is inevitable while also hinting at what the future has in store for drivers and the shipping industry. Here’s what he has to say and why the executive is confident his company will survive.

Are oil companies bleeding us dry on purpose almost everywhere in the world? The national average price for fuel has dropped from $5 to $4.9 a gallon but it remains unnervingly high in some places from California Alaska and Idaho. There’s a clear explanation for this and we already told you what can be done to lower the price of gas. Unfortunately nothing relevant has happened in the last couple of weeks in this respect. We’re still paying a lot more than we would’ve liked to.Keeping in mind the scenario we’re currently living ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods says in a CNBC interview published on YouTube that electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Rivian Lucid Ford BMW or GM are the future. The executive even anticipates that until we reach the year 2040 every car van or truck that reaches the consumer will be zero-emission.The representative of the company that has lied about global warming for 40 years says they projected that oil demand will constantly fall and that won’t mean refining oil is going to be a thing of the past. Wood is convinced ExxonMobil will thrive even after all vehicles switch to electric propulsion.“Chemical products play a really important role in people’s lives today. As you move forward into the future (…) chemicals are going to continue to play a really important role. That’s driving a lot of what we do and is a part of the reason why we’ve invested in this plant in Corpus Christi. The other big driver is industrial fuels transportation fuels… Heavy duty! (…) Those tend to be a bigger piece of what we do in terms of delivering value” said ExxonMobil’s CEO.The executive also says that the facilities that are in use today will remain relevant thanks to their biofuels producing capabilities. He also thinks ExxonMobil is flexible enough to survive everything that’s to come especially as nobody can predict what the transition to EVs will eventually look like.""We don't view ourselves as being in the gasoline business or the diesel business"" pointed out the CEO.Darren Wood worked for ExxonMobil as a chemical engineer before being appointed CEO of the oil company. His expertise might be the one that leads the entity beyond the need for fossil fuels. ExxonMobil might remain a key player in manufacturing derivates from oil. Today there are over 6000 products made from petroleum. Crude oil isn’t turned into just gas or diesel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9leHhvbi1uby1uZXctZ2FzLWNhcnMtYnktMjA0MC13b2xmLWluLXNoZWVwcy1jbG90aGluZy1jbzIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon CEO says no new gas cars globally by 2040 goes wolf in sheep's clothing about CO2,"Every new passenger car sold in the world will be electric by 2040 according to Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods in an interview aired this weekend by CNBC.

The interview also covered the company’s climate ambitions putting a flashy coat of paint on an organization that is the world’s fifth-largest historical polluter and has pushed climate denial at a high level for half a century.

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods sat down with CNBC’s David Faber for a long interview about climate change. The full interview is 35 minutes long (on top of a previous hour-long interview) and mostly discusses climate change and Exxon’s carbon capture and storage desires.

The interview sounds at first glance surprisingly reasonable and candid. Woods does not deny the scientific reality of climate change calls for carbon reductions and a higher global carbon price and recognizes that electric cars are coming.

But in view of Exxon’s history Woods looks more like a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

No new gas cars by 2040

Of particular note is that he seems to think that sales of new gas-powered passenger vehicles will end in 2040 globally – before even many governments do. Some governments have set a target earlier than that – for example 2035 in California and Europe (some European countries will go even earlier); 2030(-ish) in Washington; and the gold standard 2025 in Norway. But there are others that have either set no target or that have set later targets like China’s and Japan’s 2035 targets that still allow gas cars and the US which currently has no target but the earliest nationwide proposal is for 2045.

We’ve written before about how many of these targets will likely be exceeded (and also why post-2035 ambitions are pathetic) but the notion that Exxon also sees these targets being exceeded is quite interesting. Particularly given that not long ago Saudi Aramco the world’s largest oil company said that it expects 90% of vehicles to still be driven by internal combustion engines in “mid-century” and industry analyst IHS Markit thinks only 30% of new cars in “key automotive markets” (i.e. not globally) will be electric in 2040.

So Exxon is a big outlier here and is predicting a much earlier end to gas vehicles than most other groups.

However Woods still claimed this isn’t a threat to Exxon’s business. He said that even if all new cars were electric by 2040 that would only drop oil demand back down to 2013-2014 levels by Exxon’s calculations. Since the company was profitable then he sees a future where it can remain profitable even with that level of demand.

A much larger part of the interview is devoted to Exxon’s plans for carbon capture which it is clear that Woods sees as a potential future revenue stream that Exxon can leverage.

Carbon Capture as another revenue stream

Woods paints a rosy picture of Exxon’s potential for contribution but it’s easy to see the dollar signs in his eyes while he does so.

He claimed that Exxon is responsible for more carbon capture than any other company in the world (by capturing CO2 from its facilities “some” of which it stores and the rest which it uses in operations…to help drill for more oil) and he thinks that Exxon can be a leader in “direct air capture” in the future.

Direct air capture is the idea that carbon can be taken directly out of the air and then sequestered in some way to make sure it stays out of the atmosphere. Environmentalists have questioned whether it is a valuable goal or if it risks delaying climate action or simply works to serve oil industry profits.

Currently it is very costly as Woods pointed out in the interview stating that it is “too expensive” to consider right now. (Would this excuse work if you threw your trash in the street and told your neighbors/city it’s “too expensive” to pay taxes for trash pickup? try it out and report back in the comments.) And the least expensive carbon storage would be to leave that carbon in the ground where it currently is in the first place.

On this tack Exxon has recently asked for a higher carbon price because this would help incentivize companies to develop carbon capture technology which is true – if Exxon or some other company could eventually capture carbon at a cost of $80 a ton and the carbon price is $100 a ton. Then it could profit by removing carbon from the air and this will incentivize cleanup while disincentivizing pollution.

But we’ve heard this carbon pricing story before from Exxon. Last year Exxon lobbyist Keith McCoy was caught on tape by Greenpeace revealing the company’s reason for publicly supporting carbon pricing. The lobbyist said that Exxon felt it was politically safe to advocate for carbon pricing because it makes the company look good (known as “greenwashing“) but that “a carbon tax is not going to happen” so Exxon benefits from goodwill but gets to continue benefiting from massive subsidies.

It is possible that Exxon has now earnestly changed its position only one year later but even if it has it certainly feels like Exxon may have only changed that position because it sees potential for profit. And given Exxon’s history on climate the wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing theory is quite persuasive.

The mess is Exxon’s – why should it profit from cleanup?

In the interview Woods completely failed to take responsibility for Exxon’s tremendous contributions to climate change. When Faber asked whether there is any question that climate change is human-made Woods stated that there’s no question it is and that “it was always understood that CO2 in the atmosphere had potential for warming.”

This statement is true; scientists have known for a long time that CO2 increases warming and that humans are causing this. But Woods blatantly ignored a half-century of Exxon’s efforts to cast doubt on climate science which it is currently being tried in court over and which McCoy admitted to in Greenpeace’s investigation. Exxon knew climate change was happening and lied about it and Woods not only doesn’t acknowledge those lies but claims Exxon never told those lies – which is itself another lie.

And while Exxon plans to lower its carbon emissions and become carbon neutral by 2050 that only accounts for its “scope 1 and 2” carbon emissions. This only counts company-owned facilities and vehicles and the energy they use but it does not account for the impact of various impacts like distribution leased assets employee travel and most importantly Exxon’s products which account for the vast majority of any fossil fuel company’s “scope 3” emissions (for Exxon about 85% of its emissions are scope 3).

Exxon has not committed to carbon neutrality for scope 3 emissions so its “carbon neutral” commitment means it will offset 100%… of 15% of its emissions.

Part of Woods’ plan includes other ways to leverage Exxon’s vast store of hydrocarbons and its existing infrastructure into cleaner-burning fuels. Rather than eliminating petrochemicals from our energy supply which is necessary for the climate Woods wants blue hydrogen (cracked from methane rather than green hydrogen which is generated through electrolysis of water) biofuels and ammonia to play a part in the conversation. He is sure to point out the “challenges” of solar wind and battery storage – three products his company isn’t involved in. And he explained how LNG could fix Europe’s heating issues rather than geothermal heat pumps electric heating or other less-polluting or more efficient solutions. Weird – almost like he’s selling us something.

Despite that Exxon a single company has sold products responsible for almost 3% of all of humanity’s historical carbon emissions Woods claims that Exxon can be a large part of the cleanup which seems appropriate since Exxon made the mess in the first place.

And at the $100/ton price that Exxon seems to favor it would cost several trillion dollars to make up for its historical contribution to carbon emissions and at least $65 billion for its scope 3 emissions for the year 2020. Exxon made $181 billion in revenue and $30 billion in profit in 2020.

But rather than spending the $65 billion a year it needs to clean up its scope 3 CO2 at the price it favors Exxon has announced a plan to spend just $15 billion over 6 years ($2.5 billion per year) on its scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction plan.

The emissions blame game

Woods plays the blame game which is so common with every entity these days with respect to climate change. In this game everyone stands around pointing fingers blaming some other entity for climate change absolving themselves as only responding to market forces and claiming that action can only happen once some other entity takes action first.

Exxon in this case was only responding to “consumer demand” and still responds to consumer demand selling oil because there are buyers for it. Woods foresees continuing to meet that demand and considers Exxon the savior for people around the world who are “living in energy poverty.” But a large majority of currently proven oil reserves must stay in the ground if we want to avoid catastrophe and that catastrophe will disproportionately affect those people living in poverty. He also blames government for not crafting consistent and efficient regulation after Exxon has lobbied against action for decades.

Meanwhile consumers point out Exxon’s contribution to climate change – the 2.6% of scope 3 carbon emissions the company’s products are responsible for – and claim there is a lack of nonpolluting options. Then blame government for not acting to pass climate legislation while also complaining about high prices for a fuel that needs to stay in the ground anyway and basing their votes on whichever candidate “seems more fun to have a beer with” rather than which one will keep our only home from burning.

And governments stand by in a cowardly manner because of fear that voters will blame them for any disruption of the energy industry and that companies will leverage their power toward unseating any representative who affects the profits of established polluting firms (rather than funding them as those firms currently do).

This behavior is echoed on a worldwide level as governments and citizens wonder why they should act when that other country over there “isn’t doing enough” – a common excuse used by the world’s climate criminals.

So everybody points the finger at everybody else and uses this to absolve themselves of blame and to justify inaction.

And the worst part is that everyone is partially right. Nobody is doing enough. Everyone can do more.

But the “wait and see” approach (or worse Exxon’s “propose solutions you think are too unpopular or not technologically or politically viable enough to happen” approach) doesn’t solve any problems. We can’t all stand around pointing fingers and loudly proclaiming our innocence while the boat sinks. We have to grab a pail and start bailing and the more powerful entities like perhaps the 16th largest company by market cap in the world have to leverage that power to bail harder.

Exxon mustn’t wait for the carbon prices to incentivize cleanup – it needs to clean up its mess now and make up for the century of messes it has caused and the lies it continues to tell. Consumers have to stop making excuses for sticking to the status quo and need to demand more action from governments and from themselves because everyone’s life is going to have to change somehow or another to fix the biggest problem humanity has ever faced (and caused). And governments need to take courageous and bold action and call Exxon’s bluff on carbon pricing – which a majority of Americans in every congressional district support.

And if we do all that maybe we’ll even beat Exxon Mobil’s 2040 all-EV target.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZWxldHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy5jb20vZXZzL2V4eG9uLW1vYmlsLWNlby1zYXlzLWV2ZXJ5LW5ldy12ZWhpY2xlLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC13aWxsLWJlLWVsZWN0cmljLWJ5LTIwNDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon Mobil CEO says every new vehicle in the world will be electric by 2040,"Written by Cláudio Afonso | info@claudio-afonso.com | LinkedIn | Twitter

Wood added that the company projected that by then the oil demand “will be what it was back in 2013 – 2014” and that Exxon Mobil was “pretty successful” during those years. The CEO said that the company knew that the “change would come at some pace” adding that it is “not going to break the business and the industry”.

Recently the European Parliament voted for an effective EU ban on the sale of new combustion engine cars from 2035. The proposal passed by 339 votes to 249 with 24 abstentions at a session in France. In the European Union vehicles are responsible for 12 percent of all CO2 emissions.

The automakers will now have to cut carbon-dioxide emissions by 100 percent by the middle of the next decade and also a 55 percent reduction in CO2 from automobiles in 2030 compared with 2021.

Civil society activist Yog Mahadeo says the 2016 oil agreement between the government and ExxonMobil is like the proverbial knee on the necks of Guyanese and the group he is part of has the right to advocate on matters of public interest in line with Article 13 of the Constitution.

In an interview with the Sunday Stabroek Mahadeo said that since its formation last year Article 13 has addressed a broad range of subjects including the need for the appointment of the procurement commission and other constitutional bodies the absence of confirmed appointees at the top of the judiciary and the need to renegotiate the controversial 2016 Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) with ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL).

Mahadeo said that the group of civic-minded citizens who now constitute Article 13 have been speaking out on numerous transgressions over the 15 years by governments and political figures and are mostly independents who were also outspoken during the five months of the 2020 general and regional elections impasse.

“As individuals we saw the elections impasse as something we needed to stand up and speak about. We took a lot of blows threats and personal attacks but we stood our grounds. It wasn’t the PPP/C alone that fought for an end to that elections impasse. The independent media including Stabroek News and people like ourselves were outspoken. Post 2020 swearing in myself and others included gave the government some time to get their act together” Mahadeo said.

The individuals came together in late July 2021 concerned that a year after the new government took office good governance and democracy were not going the way they should and that the government was quickly squandering the opportunity conferred by the elections and sweeping aside independent thinking Mahadeo said.

He added the name Article 13 proposed by chartered accountant Christopher Ram was agreed to because it speaks to an inclusionary democracy and when things go wrong anywhere people call the media or those who they think will represent them.

“We decided Article 13 of the constitution was the basis on which we would be proactive engage government the private sector civil society the diplomatic community among others and it gives us the constitutional platform to speak on behalf of the people” he stated.

Article 13 of the constitution says: “The principal objective of the political system of the State is to establish an inclusionary democracy by providing increasing opportunities for the participation of citizens and their organisations in the management and decision making processes of the State withparticular emphasis on those areas of decision-making that directly affect their well-being”.

From the inception Article 13 declared it was not a political party. “We wanted the people’s voice represented and heard by the government the legislature and the judiciary.”

On Article 13’s legitimacy Mahadeo said “We are here. Our application for formal registration is in place. We have not collected monies or solicited donations in any way and while we do not solicit membership we have gotten signed membership across the country. Wherever we visited people are interested and want to become members and supporters of Article 13.”

Noting that Article 13 recently represented Guyana’s civil society at the Summit of the Americas he said “No one can question our legitimacy which was given to us as a birthright by our Constitution. It is a fundamental right to associate to get together and no one can take that away from us. Legal standing or not the fact that we are Article 13 alone gives us the ability and the freedom to represent and speak on behalf of our people.”

Somehow it appears he said that anybody who speaks out wants political power or has something against the PPP or against the PNC. “People just want the right things to happen regardless of what government is in place.”

Critically supportive

Article 13 he said also sees one of its roles as being critically supportive of the government. “Our aim is to make Guyana a better a better place. We are not going to be better under the current oil contract with ExxonMobil or the current swath of corruption taking place here.”

Article 13 in a release had brought to the public’s attention to the fact that a year had passed with the PPP/C in government and it had not put in place a Public Procurement Commission (PPC) and several other constitutional bodies while government was “busy signing on and giving away contracts without the mandatory bodies in place.”

While the members of the PPC have been identified by parliament they are yet to be sworn in by President Irfaan Ali.

Article 13 also called on the government the opposition and others to look at judicial appointments. “We feel it’s a shame the judiciary of Guyana keeps on being trampled by acting appointments. Justices Carl Singh and Ian Chang retired in acting positions”

The current administration he said started to make some noise about the appointment of Justices Roxane George Yonette Cummings-Edwards and Rishi Persaud.

“Suddenly we hear they are thinking about one but not the others because of decisions made. Our position is government is holding back because they want to control the judges’ decisions. Not agreeing with a judge’s decision is a mere state of play because a higher court will rule for or against a lower court’s decision as was proven during the elections fiasco. You cannot say you will appoint one but not the other. By doing that you are telling the other you better behave yourself because we are going to appoint you. That is bad in character in principle and in practice.”

The opposition not recognizing the government he said should not have affected consultations for appointments because the opposition filling the seats in Parliament meant recognition. “I don’t feel it was because of the byplay between the opposition and government. I suspect they were just happy to go along with the flow until they found their own people to put in these bodies.”

Other areas Article 13 is currently looking at include the local content policy and equal pay in the extractive sector.

Man up

Article 13 on Tuesday protested outside of the Ministry of Natural Resources against the 2016 PSA that former natural resources minister Raphael Trotman signed.

“That contract is the proverbial knee on the necks of all Guyanese…It is so bad President Irfaan Ali and Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo (included) renegotiation in their last elections campaign promises. Jagdeo said similar contracts were changed in other countries because the people demanded it. We are saying man up and fulfill your promise. It was bad then. It is bad now. It will be worse in the future.”

Mahadeo believes that Ali and Jagdeo would like to renegotiate the contract but they may not do so voluntarily. He argued that if Guyanese collectively demand a change they will have to act.

Last week some financials were coming out he noted. “ExxonMobil and partners make $320 billion. Guyana gets $85 billion but Guyana gives $79 billion in tax credit to ExxonMobil (and partners) … That is how horrible this contract is.”

No country would give an investor a tax certificate for zero sums of taxes paid he said. “We need to take this matter up to the New York Stock Exchange. We have an oil company that didn’t pay taxes but in its books to its investors on the stock exchange it is going show that they paid taxes because they received a tax certificate from Guyana.”

Everyone rightfully blames the APNU+AFC government for the contract but a new government is in place and they must change the contract he said.

While everyone speaks on the sanctity of the contract he said Guyana has had a history of breaking contracts. “Burnham nationalised everybody. The PPP liberalised telecoms. Why are we now like saints talking about the sanctity of contracts? The stability clause in the oil contract is a noose squeezing the breath out of us. The contract has basically said the National Assembly is powerless and cannot make any laws that can change it. You have taken the power away from the voters and removed their ability to vote for a government that can pass laws on their behalf” Mahadeo argued.

Corruption

Since this government took office Mahadeo noted they have given out cash in public assistance in the forms of Covid-19 relief to households flood relief relief to fishermen sugar workers among others.

“Show me one audit. It is really being seen as a payoff to supporters. It is no less than an early election’s campaign government has started. All of the cash handouts must be audited and full reports disclosed publicly” he asserted.

Noting that Article 13 protests once a week he said last week they joined the General Workers Union in calling for an increase in the minimum wage in the private sector. Government subsequently announced a $60000 a month minimum wage after initially saying that a study was needed. “We believe it should have been no less than $75000-minimum wage as in the public sector.”

The government also announced a part-time employment scheme which has raised the minimum wage to $4000 a day while ignoring the public and private sectors’ minimum wage. “They are being paid $40000 for ten days of work. It is good to create employment opportunities but again you are creating a nightmare for the rest of Guyana” Mahadeo said.

Emerging country of concern

Article 13’s participation as a civil society representative in the Summit of the Americas was based on public invitations for civil society’s participation and public presentations. Article 13 signed up for participation in the areas of democratic governance and a green future. This included taking part in thematic working groups online and summarised presentations to the heads of government during the latter half of the summit. At the summit they were engaged in three days of working sessions with other civil society groups including from Cuba and Nicaragua whose governments were not invited because of their non-democratic posture.

Mahadeo who represented Article 13 in the democratic governance group said he spoke about what happened over the past ten years and what is happening currently and the need to evaluate Guyana as an emerging country of concern in the region in terms of democracy and corruption.

In the presentation to the green futures group he said Guyana has significant issues where the environment is concerned.

“We have an Environmental Protection Agency that waives any need for an environmental impact assessment where oil and gas projects are concerned or if it does call for one ExxonMobil does it.”

He added that there is no ongoing evaluation on what is happening with the waste and byproducts offshore and of the millions of cubic feet of gas that is being flared every day.

On senior government officials lambasting civil society Mahadeo said “Not only did they attack Article 13 or civil society but they became personal. Because I am a prime person in Article 13 I was deemed as someone who didn’t get what I wanted and now I am the loudest critic of the government.”

Article 13 took the attacks to mean they were making an impact. “The attacks literally took the covering off. People who never heard of Article 13 before started to focus. It might have caused a little upset targeting my family but it provided an impetus for us to continue.”

One of the things Article 13 achieved from the attacks was making young people aware that they can stand up and speak up he said. “People are fearful of repercussions fearful of losing their jobs fearful for their family. People speak in hushed whispers and tones because of these attacks. When the government attack people like me they are sending a message to others. We have no less than 60 or 70 persons who have signed on to us ticking out that block in our form their wish to remain confidential. We have to respect that because it is their right. The attacks will continue.”"

June 26 2022—FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) and Direct Relief continue to support those affected by the conflict in Ukraine. On Sunday June 26 FedEx Express safely delivered 52 tons of critical medical aid to Poland from the United States via a FedEx humanitarian relief flight. This follows FedEx and Direct Relief’s first charter flight of aid for Ukrainian refugees in March and is the latest in a continuous series of shipments from Direct Relief.

Aid aboard the FedEx Express Boeing 777 cargo aircraft included substantial quantities of emergency medicines and supplies including health kits trauma and wound care items chronic disease and chemical exposure medications and antibiotics. All items were provided at the request of and approved by Ukraine’s Ministry of Health and local Ukrainian organizations. Direct Relief team members were on site for the offload and the aid will be distributed to health facilities within Ukraine.

“As the war enters its fourth month Direct Relief’s support and solidarity remain steadfastly with the people of Ukraine” said Thomas Tighe Direct Relief President and CEO. “In addition to the heartbreaking loss of life and human toll the war has had a devastating impact on health services in the country and Direct Relief is committed to bolstering care with a continuous supply of medical aid. FedEx has created a powerful force multiplier for good with this most recent charter and it’s an incredible example of what’s needed to address this crisis.”

Since February 24 Direct Relief has provided more than 750 tons of medical aid in response to the crisis from field medic packs — which contain items to address trauma including tourniquets and wound dressings — to diabetes and cancer medications.

“It is gratifying to be able use our global network to support these critical missions and with this charter flight we hope to make a small contribution to what is still a major humanitarian situation.” said Karen Reddington regional president of Europe FedEx Express.

Tom Tunney.City officials expect the parade to be bigger than ever with over a million people expected at the celebration in the Lakeview and Uptown neighborhoods including the LGBTQ enclave popularly known as 'Boystown.'The parade starts at 12 Noon at the corner of Broadway and Montrose. The parade featuring 154 colorful entries will then travel the 21-block parade route south on Broadway; then south on Halsted; then east on Belmont; then south on Broadway; then east on Diversey to Cannon Drive.There will be ten cross-over streets along the parade route: Montrose at Broadway Irving Park at Broadway Wellington at Broadway Barry at Broadway Oakdale at Broadway Addison at Halsted Grace at Halsted Roscoe at Halsted Aldine at Halsted and Cornelia at Halsted.Security will be tight again this year. Open container rules will continue to be strictly enforced with 170 private security workers patrolling the parade and police on every corner. Penalties include but are not limited to $1000+ tickets being issued and you could have to throw out your booze.Street closures should start at 8 a.m. for staging areas with parade route closures beginning at 9:30 a.m. or as the crowd dictates for safety issues. Closures include Montrose Irving Park and Wellington at Broadway as well as Addison Grace and Roscoe at Halsted. Streets should reopen by 8 p.m. or when deemed safe to do so.Public transportation is highly recommended. The CTA will be providing extra service and longer trains on the L and several buses will be re-routed on parade day. Bicycles will not be permitted on CTA trains for most of the day and strollers and carts must be folded before boarding all CTA buses and trains.The nearest L stops are: Wilson Sheridan Addison or Belmont on the Red Line and Southport Belmont Wellington or Diversey on the Brown Line. Bus lines are 8 22 36 80 or 152.The CTA encourages riders to avoid the Belmont station which will likely be crowded.Metra will provide extra trains on the BNSF UP North UP Northwest and UP West Lines. Other lines that operate on Sundays will offer extra seating capacity.There won't be much street parking available near the assembly or parade routes so if you're driving be prepared to park outside of the immediate area. Watch for temporary no parking signs.Sunday's forecast calls for sunny skies with a high temperature around 80 degrees according to the National Weather Service.Cooling busses will be located on Halsted south of Belmont; Addison west of Halsted; Belmont east of Broadway; Wilton north of Belmont; Buena west of Broadway.The Belmont and Addison stations (and the surrounding area) tend to become the most crowded so you are encouraged to consider watching the parade from the other parts of the route including areas toward the start of the route—such as Broadway south of Montrose—which are served by both the nearby Wilson and Sheridan stations on the Red Line.If you need first aid the Chicago Fire Department has first aid stations at 901 W. Addison St. 765 W. Roscoe St. 3165 N. Halsted St. 561 W. Surf St. and 802 W. Roscoe St. There will also be a public safety command center on Belmont Avenue between Clark and Halsted.Portable restrooms will be stationed along both the parade line-up street and the parade route. For seniors or those who need wheelchair accessible sites head near 600 W. Diversey. It's towards the end of the parade route and typically is less crowded than other streets. Many arrive early to set up chairs and claim their spots. This area also has bathrooms for those with special needs.Pride Parades commemorate the Stonewall rebellion that took place on June 281969 when patrons of a New York City gay bar the Stonewall Inn fought back during a raid by police. At that time gay bars were frequently raided across the country. That night patrons fought back and street demonstrations continued for several days. During that week gay liberation groups were formed thus giving birth to the modern-day LGBTQ+ rights movement.Pride Parades are staged in over 200+ cities worldwide in more than 125+ cities in the United States with at least 12 taking place on the last weekend in June every year. In recent years many are staged in small towns across the country and recently in various suburbs of Chicago including Buffalo Grove and Aurora Illinois.The annual Chicago Pride Parade is coordinated by PRIDEChicago under the direction of Tim Frye. This year's 51st annual Chicago Pride Parade is dedicated to Frye's late husband Richard Pfeiffer who coordinated the parade since 1974. Pfeiffer passed away in October 2019 1.

FSLR,First Solar,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vbXltb2Rlcm5tZXQuY29tL2xpZ2h0eWVhci1zb2xhci1jYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World's First Solar-Powered Car Is Ready To Hit the Road,"As electric vehicles become more common there are innovators looking to improve the technology. This includes Lex Hoefsloot CEO of Lightyear. After six years in development the company has just released Lightyear 0 the world's first solar vehicle. Without the need for a charging station this sleek electric vehicle can keep you on the road for seven months thanks to integrated solar panels.

Currently most electric cars maximize their mileage by having a battery which means that they're able to spend less time at charging stations and more time driving. However these batteries not only increase the cars' carbon footprint during production but they add weight and tie them to high-powered charging stations.

Lightyear 0 skirts this issue by ditching the battery. Instead the car features curved solar arrays that keep it charged whether drivers are commuting to work or are simply parked outdoors. The company estimates that in optimal conditions the car can power itself with 43 miles (70 km) of range per day. This means that drivers with a daily commute of 22 miles (35 km) could drive for months during the summer without needing to plug in.

In fact they estimate that drivers in sunny areas could go for seven months without having to charge via a plug. If you live in an overcast environment you'll still get two months of drive time. But what if you do need to plug in? This is where Lightyear continues to innovate. They claim that there's no need for a high-powered charging station and that the car will still charge at a rate of 20 miles (32 km) of range per hour with a regular plug and socket.

Lightyear's dedication to sustainability doesn't end with its solar panels. The entire design is meticulous in its use of recycled and sustainable materials. This includes an interior with plant-based leather and fabrics made from recycled PET bottles as well as outer panels made from reclaimed carbon and residual carbon materials.

Now road legal Lightyear 0 is arriving to consumers in Europe in November 2022. It will be produced in limited quantities with a price tag of $263126 (€250000). The goal is to then work toward a model aimed at high production with an accessible price point of $31575 (€30000). Lightyear estimates production on that model will start in late 2024 or early 2025.

Lightyear 0 is the world's first solar vehicle.

Integrated solar arrays allow for efficient charging even when parked.

And if need be any household plug can top up the car's range.

The contemporary interior uses sustainable materials.

The road-legal vehicle will be available to consumers in Europe in November 2022.

The car continued to barrel down the open stretch of road its speed dipping only slightly. “It keeps on going” said Grooten the lead engineer for the Dutch car company Lightyear as we whizzed through the lunar-like landscape. “What you feel is nothing holding you back. You feel the aerodynamics you feel the low-rolling resistance of the tyres of the bearings and the motor.”

It is this streamlined design that the company credits for allowing it to muscle its way into a space long overlooked by most car manufacturers. As early as November the company will start delivery of what it describes as the “world’s first production-ready solar car” – the Lightyear 0 a €250000 (£215000) sedan draped in 5 sq metres of curved solar panels that top up the electric battery while the car is driving or parked outdoors.

“If we would have the same amount of energy that we harvest on these panels on any other car that uses three times the amount of energy to drive it becomes useless. It becomes a very expensive gimmick” said Grooten. “You have to build this car from the ground up to make it as efficient as possible to make it this feasible.”

In optimal conditions the solar panels can add up to 44 miles a day to the 388-mile range the car gets between charges according to the company. Tests carried out by Lightyear suggest people with a daily commute of less than 22 miles could drive for two months in the Netherlands without needing to plug in while those in sunnier climes such as Portugal or Spain could go as long as seven months.

But whether the company’s gamble on solar will pay off remains to be seen said Jim Saker professor emeritus at Loughborough University and president of the Institute of the Motor Industry.

“You’re having to pay an awful lot of money and have solar panels stuck on the car for just 44 additional miles. The question mark at the moment is the fact that in reality is that actually worth it? The actual concept isn’t bad. It’s just whether the technology is actually viable to make it economically sustainable for anybody wanting to do this.”

Sales of the Lightyear 0 would probably be limited to a handful of early adopters he added. “But in reality it’s not a commercial proposition at the moment.”

Others questioned the idea of a car being touted as a salve to the ever deepening climate crisis. “The most sustainable way to approach car ownership is actually to avoid it entirely if you can at all” said Vera O’Riordan a PhD student focusing on low-carbon pathways and policies for passenger transport at University College Cork in Ireland.

While electric vehicles may have a limited role to play in rural areas that lack public transport she cited research suggesting these vehicles are often sold to high-income households in urban areas. “So you have to ask yourself the question: are you serving this individualised very inefficient very harmful and traffic-inducing transport in urban areas where it could otherwise be perfectly met by public transport and walking and cycling?”

The need to move away from cars to tackle the climate emergency is – perhaps surprisingly – echoed by Lex Hoefsloot the 31-year-old chief executive of Lightyear who has raised about €150m in investment to get it running.

“It would be great I fully agree” he said. “But I think we’re not going to change our lives too much. Perhaps when we’re really panicking in 20 years we might. But in the meantime we have to work around that.”

Since 2016 the company has championed solar energy as a key part of this work-around envisioning solar cars capable of running on clean energy and accelerating the transition away from polluting fossil fuels. “People were saying it wasn’t possible mostly because of the limited amount of solar power you could get on a car” said Hoefsloot.

His own experience however suggested otherwise. The Lightyear 0 – a sleek four-wheel drive – traces its roots to a squat box-on-wheels that ferried four helmet-clad university students across the Australian outback to win in its class in the 2013 world solar challenge.

“If it works in Australia then it works everywhere. That was the thinking” said Hoefsloot who founded Lightyear with four other members of the solar challenge team. “Early days I must admit there was a hesitation whether we should go full car manufacturing because we all know it’s not the easiest thing. But there was nobody else out there that was really willing to or doing something similar.”

In recent years there has been an upswell of interest in integrating solar panels into cars: Mercedes-Benz recently revealed plans to outfit an upcoming electric car with rooftop solar panels while Toyota has at times offered limited-capacity solar panels as an add-on to its Prius hybrid.

Next year Munich-based Sono Motors plans to roll out a €28500 solar-assisted family car while the California-based startup Aptera Motors said in 2020 that preorders for its futuristic three-wheeled solar electric vehicle sold out in less than 24 hours.

With months left before the Lightyear 0’s production run there are still kinks to be worked out from a stiff steering wheel to the buzz that at times fills the car when the air conditioning kicks in.

Once you are in the car there is little about the driving experience that feels different from other electric cars – “That’s a huge compliment that’s what we’re aiming for” one staff member tells me – save for a smattering of reminders about the constant drip feed of solar energy. One screen shows exactly what cells are feeding off the sun at any given moment while another quantifies how much solar energy is being absorbed.

In an effort to use as much of this solar energy as possible the windswept design eschews side-view mirrors for cameras and runs off lightweight electric motors tucked into its wheels. The body panels are crafted from reclaimed carbon fibre and the interiors are fashioned from vegan plant-based leather with fabrics made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate bottles.

The 20-minute test run is probably the only time I will sit at the wheel of the Lightyear 0. With its hefty price tag – ideally paid by those who have an outdoor parking space to maximise the car’s gain from the sun – it is not a car for the masses.

Instead the company envisions the production run which will offer up to 946 vehicles for delivery across Europe and the UK as a beginning of sorts. “This is a small scale to validate to the world that we can produce a car” said Telian Franken the prototype team lead.

From there the company will shift its focus to a second solar-assisted electric car it is aiming to sell for about €30000 as early as 2025. “We’re trying to make the difference not for the millionaire who can afford a €250000 car but to get us to the point where the average person can get off grid – get a reliable sustainable vehicle that beats toe-for-toe any econo-box you can get at the time” said Franken citing the Toyota Corolla or Honda Accord as examples. “That’s what we’re trying to beat – and replace – because it’s not sustainable.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU5NDM3NS9saWdodHllYXItemVyby1maXJzdC1sb29rL9IBQGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU5NDM3NS9saWdodHllYXItemVyby1maXJzdC1sb29rL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video: Lightyear 0 Solar Electric Car First Look,"Dutch startup Lightyear recently revealed the production version of its solar-powered EV the 0. A rarity in the auto industry the only other major SEV (Solar Electric Vehicle) manufacturer is Aptera.

The Lightyear 0 is powered by a 60 kWh battery. The SEV is capable of up to 388 miles per charge. The 0 can also drive up to 44 miles per day on solar power alone more than enough for most daily needs. That is in ""ideal conditions"" however - expect significantly less solar range in cloudier climates.

The 0 is not a particularly fast car. 0-62 mph takes 10 seconds meanwhile total power output is a mere 174 hp. Top speed is 100 mph. Also unlike the more affordable Aptera Lightyear's Zero is far from accessible for most people - just 946 will be made with prices starting at $263000. Hence the 0 is more of a collector's item than an actual alternative to a Mercedes EQS Lucid Air or Tesla Model S.

Jordan from Out Of Spec Reviews recently traveled to Spain to get a quick drive in a Zero. He was very impressed with its build quality and also had a lot of praise for its efficiency. For his full thoughts check out the above video.

Photo credit: WHO Somalia.

Mogadishu 26 June 2022– From 13 to 17 June 2022 the Federal Ministry of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization (WHO) country office for Somalia hosted a technical mission from WHO headquarters and Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean comprising experts from the new Innovation Hub team as well as the Environment Climate Change and Health team. The mission aimed to bring together key partners including United Nations agencies nongovernmental organizations and donors to explore and advocate for ways to reinforce the Somali health system using climate-friendly solutions such as the use of solar power for delivering oxygen and electrifying health facilities especially in remote and hard-to-reach locations.

The global climate crisis identified as the single largest health crisis facing humanity today has resulted in an extreme phenomenon of droughts and floods occurring on an annual basis in Somalia. Meanwhile the ongoing drought has left Somalia on the brink of famine with a sobering 6.1 million people food insecure and 1.7 million people suffering from extreme levels of hunger.

Coupled with high rates of indoor air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels in households and air temperatures which are estimated to be rising every year these conditions are brewing an inescapable health storm in an already fragile country.

WHO has installed 3 solar-powered medical oxygen systems in Dhushamareb Baidoa and Kismayo. The first plant set up early in 2021 in Dhushamareb paved the way for replication and possible expansion as there was a survival rate of 96% in children who were admitted in this hospital with birth asphyxia pneumonia and other medical conditions that required immediate oxygen therapy. These children may have otherwise lost their lives without access to high-grade medical oxygen provided by this innovative system.

“During our innovative journey to improve medical oxygen access we discovered that the necessity for a reliable source of electricity can be met using solar power. Innovation can make this feasible and sustainable in Somalia. Therefore we are now considering the possibility of using solar power to provide enough electricity to power entire health facilities – from medical oxygen and refrigerators for vaccines to incubators lighting and operating theatres” said HE Dr Fawziya Abikar Nur the Minister of Health and Human Services the Federal Government of Somalia.

After a visit to the solar-powered oxygen plant in the Hanano Hospital in Dhushamareb the Director a.i. Department for Digital Health and Innovation and Unit Head at the WHO Innovation Hub Louise Agersnap urged partners to reflect on the situation in Somalia. “What makes a pregnant woman travel for hundreds of miles to deliver a baby that she can hold? It is that “lighthouse” of a hospital that has reliable solar-powered electricity that can secure a safe birth” she said. “Innovation is a tool to solve problems and in this case we solved many in one shot. Somalia is leading the way and we at the WHO Innovation Hub are proud to collaborate with the Government and WHO country team. Their innovative use of solar power is bringing multiple wins to the country – it is saving lives; saving health care costs; and saving the environment as it uses green renewable energy.”

“Delaying action would be denying action” said Salvatore Vinci WHO Sustainable Energy Advisor. “We must act now to support more health facilities to access power through solar energy. Somalia makes the best case for investment in solar energy in health centres ─ with hours of sunshine limited and expensive electricity as well as hospitals without reliable power.""

While explaining how the electrification of facilities could be useful WHO’s Technical Lead and Unit Head of Air Quality Energy and Health Heather Adair-Rohani said “Electrifying health care facilities with solar energy can ensure access to quality essential services for women and children promote the uptake of health care services cut health care costs all the while protecting our climate.”

Dr Mamunur Rahman Malik WHO Representative to Somalia and Head of Mission emphasized ""There is no alternative for oxygen. Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of child deaths in Somalia. Every child and every human have the right to breathe clean air drink clean water and access good-quality health services. It is incumbent on us all to ensure every Somali has access to these basic human rights using innovative and climate-friendly solutions.”

English view video Stephen A. Smith's NFL Playoffs Predictions

The Wall Street Journal first reported the possible suspension on Saturday evening. If such a suspension is handed down and survives any appeal by Watson and the NFL Players Association—the union representing NFL players—it would mean that by the time Watson suits up for a game it would have been more than two years after the last time he took a snap. He last played in January 2021 for the Houston Texans in their final regular season game against the Tennessee Titans. He sat out the following season in a dispute with ownership over whether he would be traded.

As that dispute played out multiple women came forward accusing Watson of sexually assaulting or harassing them during massage sessions he booked in the Houston area. Ultimately Watson was investigated criminally but two grand juries declined to indict him. He faced civil lawsuits from 24 women though a New York Times investigation published in May found that there were more accusers who didn’t file lawsuits while other women said they gave him massages without any issue.



On June 21 the attorney representing all 24 plaintiffs Tony Buzbee announced that 20 of the cases had reached confidential settlements. He said he expected the same thing for the other four lawsuits soon.



But Watson who was traded to Cleveland in March has participated in the Browns’ offseason practices under the cloud of impending discipline from the NFL which has a conduct policy for players that allows for suspensions fines or both even if players are never charged with a crime or held liable in civil court. Other players notably former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger have been suspended after facing sexual assault allegations. But his ban was under a previous version of the league’s policy.

The Wall Street Journal quoted unnamed sources familiar with the NFL’s investigation describing how they expect it will be resolved.

The people familiar with the case anticipate an outcome the week of July 4 although there remains a chance of it coming sooner. His arbitration hearing is scheduled to begin this upcoming week. The NFL Players Association and Watson’s lawyers meanwhile are preparing to vigorously fight such a tough ban of the embattled Cleveland Browns quarterback...Watson’s is the first case under the NFL’s new collectively bargained personal conduct policy which places the initial ruling in the hands of a neutral arbitrator.

“There were cheers throughout City Hall Friday afternoon (June 17)” Mayor Ed Orcutt told cleveland.com. “I couldn’t be more excited for transitioning the property into the Forward Innovation Center. This grant was the result of excellent teamwork.”

Brook Park’s brownfield remediation project was one of 112 throughout the state to receive a financial boost. The state awarded more than $190 million for projects located in 41 Ohio counties.

A press release from the governor’s office indicated “all but one building on the (Brook Park) site has been demolished but concrete slabs and demolition debris remain.”

“Remediation activities include abatement and removal of hazardous waste soil remediation and installation of a vapor mitigation system” the press release said. “After cleanup the property will be redeveloped as the Forward Innovation Center a manufacturing and distribution hub of 12 buildings totaling 3 million square feet of office warehouse and industrial space.”

Orcutt told City Council at its June 21 meeting the city will learn in the coming weeks how the grant money will be distributed.

“The intentions for these funds will be for public utilities water and sanitary sewer (infrastructure) and also for environmental cleanup and demolition” Orcutt said. “This grant will also provide huge assistance for the economic development of that land.

“This was a very big win for the city of Brook Park and we’re very proud of that.”

In doing so he built the idea of vertical integration and supply chains.

He didn't worry about rewarding shareholders with profits through dividends or higher stock prices according to an analysis by the New York Times on what today's manufacturers could learn from Ford.

In a fundamental sense that aspect of Ford's legacy has been lost. Shareholder value is accepted as the principal value of publicly owned markets. Also just-in-time manufacturing with its focus on leveraging efficiency to perpetually reduce the ""buffer"" in a company's supply chain has dominated industry for decades.

Lastly vertical integration the way Ford envisioned it — with a giant company owning the production of all the materials in its supply chain to ensure availability and reliability — has long dissipated in favor of a focus on corporate core competencies where companies outsource everything else to global business partners.

And yet current events force us to revisit the balance between long-term resiliency and short-term profitability. In the example of Ford Motor Co. thousands of cars currently still sit unfinished at manufacturing plants in Detroit because of a supply-chain crunch for semiconductor chips manufactured by a single company in Taiwan.

Interestingly as described in the Times article Ford has shown ""greater inclination"" to limit dividends and preserve capital. The chip companies though are limiting capacity to maintain high prices.

So what's the bottom line? Shareholder value just-in-time supply chains and outsourcing are not going to go away. They have been proven over time to be the most efficient way to manage large corporations.

But the lessons of Warren Buffett (a financier not a builder of new businesses) have value here. Buffett long ago posed the following hypothetical to goad businesses to focus on long-term resiliency to ensure long-term profitability: If you owned 100% of a company as opposed to a massively diversified portfolio what decisions would you make to increase the chances of its long-term survival and success?

Applying Buffett's question to Ford's current chip gap you would almost certainly choose to diversify your sources of key semiconductors rather than the short-term lowest cost option of having a single provider in a location as fraught with uncertainties as Taiwan.

Lance Woolridge and Elvéne Vonk qualified third on Friday but unfortunately retired on Saturday after picking up engine trouble

Christo Rose and Arno Olivier scored second consecutive third-place finish in Class T in their privateer NWM Ford Ranger V8

UPINGTON South Africa 26 June 2022 – The Neil Woolridge Motorsport (NWM) Ford Castrol Team endured a tough Desert Race in Upington this weekend with tenacity and a never-say-die attitude producing a determined drive to fifth place in Class FIA T1+ and 10th overall for Gareth Woolridge and Boyd Dreyer (277)*.

Team-mates Lance Woolridge and Elvéne Vonk (234) were unfortunately forced to retire after encountering engine trouble on Saturday morning.

The team had hoped for a strong showing at the Toyota Gazoo Racing 1000 Desert Race round two of the 2022 South African Cross Country Series (SARRC). As a marathon three-day event covering almost 1 000km and with 1.5-times the normal points haul up for grabs it’s an important race for the championship.

Friday’s action seemed on track to deliver an exciting battle for the podium as Lance and Elvéne set the third-fastest time in the 43km qualifying loop in their EcoBoost-powered NWM Castrol Ford Ranger just 7 seconds off the Toyotas of Giniel de Villers/Dennis Murphy and Guy Botterill/Simon Vacy-Lyle who posted identical times.

Intensifying the battle at the front Gareth and Boyd were a mere 2 seconds off their team-mates in the second NWM Ranger in qualifying – but their progress was halted as an oil cooler split just 10km into the opening race loop. The young pair used their mechanical know-how to bypass the cooler and soldiered on at a cautious pace having already lost 1 hour and 16 minutes which pushed them to the back of the field.

In contrast Lance and Elvéne were flying and were running in second place for much of the 171km opening loop. However they were caught out by some tricky navigation at the end of the stage which cost them around four minutes dropping them to fourth place in the overnight standings.

The competitors repeated the same 171km loop twice on Saturday. Unfortunately Lance and Elvéne’s hopes of recovering from a non-finish at the opening round in Dullstroom in March came to nothing as they were brought to a halt halfway through the day’s first loop with engine trouble forcing them to retire from the race.

“It was extremely disappointing for us as we were going really well and definitely had the pace to challenge for a podium finish” Lance said. “It’s also a heavy blow for us in the championship but we will come back fighting at the next race.”

Meanwhile Gareth and Boyd threw caution to the wind on Saturday and had impressively worked their way from 32nd place to 17th overall and 5th in T1+ when the day’s racing drew to a close. Their objective going into Sunday’s two new loops of 170km each were for a top 10 finish – and they achieved their goal with a determined and faultless drive. They had clawed back four places by the end of the first loop and secured the top result in the final stint ultimately finishing 10th overall and securing fifth in class.

“This was certainly not the result we had hoped for coming into the Desert Race but having started at the back of the field on Saturday it’s the best we could have hoped for considering our bad luck on Friday and the time we lost” Gareth said. “Fifth place in T1+ gives us some crucial points for the championship so it was worth pushing hard right through to the finish.”

Team principal Neil Woolridge added: “It was a challenging weekend for the team. Both crews drove really well and it’s unfortunate that they encountered trouble. Nevertheless it’s encouraging that Lance and Elvéne were very close to the pace of the leaders throughout Friday and Gareth and Boyd did an exceptional job fighting their way through the field on Saturday and Sunday.

“We’re still working on finding some additional pace for our cars to ensure we are competitive for the remainder of the season” Neil said. “We are going straight into a three-day test here in Upington this week with our new partners M-Sport. With this intensive test session I’m confident that we will make significant progress with the setup of our Rangers giving us a strong platform to challenge for the second half of the season.”

NWM-supported privateers

In Class T NWM Ranger V8 privateers Christo Rose and Arno Olivier (T58) battled through a challenging weekend to finish third despite losing two hours in Saturday’s afternoon loop untangling wire that had wrapped around the propshaft and dealing with a radiator issue on Sunday. Reward came in achieving their second consecutive podium finish of the season.

The next race is the Bronkhorstspruit 400 on 19 and 20 August 2022.

(Arizona’s Family/Gray News) - Police in Arizona say a baby who nearly drowned earlier this month in a bathtub has died and his babysitter was arrested.

Arizona’s Family initially reported that Cynthia Gaddy 49 was charged with child neglect after a 1-year-old baby she was watching had to be rushed to the hospital in critical condition after nearly drowning in the bathtub on June 16.

The El Mirage Police Department said Gaddy reportedly told police she left two children alone in the bathtub with the water running to attend to a smelly diaper.

According to police while Gabby was gone she heard a timer go off in the kitchen for something she was baking. When she returned to the bathroom she found the tub overflowing and the baby face down in the water.

Officers said the babysitter called 911 and first responders were able to revive the child. He was then taken to a hospital in critical condition.

El Mirage police updated the baby’s condition this week and said the boy died Friday night.

Authorities said their investigation continues and are working with the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office regarding the case with this week’s updates.

(WSMV/Gray News) - Police are investigating a man who allegedly was using a cashback scheme at multiple grocery stores.

The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department reports that 24-year-old Austin Chase Hooper was arrested for committing fraud at self-checkout kiosks at Kroger supermarkets.

According to an arrest affidavit Hooper would purchase a small item using the cashback option with a card at self-checkouts at Kroger stores as reported by WSMV.

Before the money could dispense Hooper allegedly placed a bag over the cash dispenser and concealed the funds the kiosk provided.

Authorities said he would quickly pocket the cash call a Kroger attendant and tell the worker that the machine did not dispense any money.

On Aug. 22 2021 Steve Woodwall with Kroger Loss Prevention reportedly spotted Hooper’s connection with these incidents and banned him from all Kroger locations.

The 24-year-old was later indicted for theft and burglary according to authorities.

The affidavit stated that 21 incidents involved Hooper attempting his cashback scheme at Kroger stores in the area.

Ed Hill visited the company’s Electronic Systems division in Rochester to see its unveiling.

Head-up display (HUD) systems have a long history in the world of military aircraft but are a more recent development in the field of commercial aviation. Designed to display important information for the pilot directly within their line of sight without having to continually refer to dials or screens mounted lower down in the cockpit the technology helps to improve a pilot’s overall situational awareness reduce workload and fatigue and provide instant flying data such as heading altitude airspeed and an artificial horizon while the pilot can still look ahead out of the window.

Now BAE Systems has launched a revolutionary new ‘LiteWave’ HUD intended for installation in commercial and military aircraft in platforms ranging from long range commercial jets and transporters to regional aircraft business jets and even smaller.

Born out of the Open Flight Deck Project a consortium-led initiative involving industrial and academic partners – BAE Systems Rolls-Royce GE Aviation and the universities of Coventry and Southampton – to create an advanced more universal and upgradable pilot/aircraft interface LiteWave is the latest application of BAE Systems’ patented digital Waveguide technology – initially developed for its military LiteHUD variant – that dispenses with much of the optics (lenses mirrors and prisms) and electronics of a traditional HUD to produce a system not much bigger than a laptop that can be mounted above the pilot’s head in a broad range of cockpit settings.

“Our engineers have created a digital display that is smaller lighter and uses less power than any other head-up display” explains Lee Tomlinson director of HUD products at BAE Systems’ Electronic Systems. “It has the potential to revolutionise the market and make HUD technology far more accessible.”

In a traditional HUD images are projected and enlarged onto a sheet of glass or ‘combiner’ by using complicated optics and electronics in a large assembly mounted on the cockpit dashboard. With LiteWave the image is projected within the laminated screen stretched vertically and horizontally and reflected back to the pilot as easily viewable heads-up information.

“LiteWave represents a 70% reduction in size and weight of this kind of product compared to conventional HUDs meaning it can be installed in cockpits where previously there would not have been the space” adds Tomlinson.

BAE Systems has also patented a special overhead mounting assembly for LiteWave which means it can be installed without the use of time-consuming adhesives. What would normally take a whole day while the adhesives cure can now be achieved in around four hours.

“We consulted with the OEMs and airlines who were frustrated at how long it can take to install a HUD system. Our mounting mechanism means that from end to end the LiteWave including levelling only takes around four hours to install. That’s an 80% reduction in the time needed to fit a head-up display” Tomlinson affirms.

A legacy of light

BAE Systems has a peerless history when it comes to developing HUD technology. Its site at Rochester Kent has been producing systems since the early 1960s. In fact the facility developed the first such system for the Royal Navy’s Blackburn Buccaneer fighter aircraft. Since then it has produced more than 15000 HUDs that are in service in more than 50 countries globally. The systems are employed on some of the most advanced modern military aircraft including the Eurofighter Typhoon F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor.

In the superfast environment of a jet fighter HUD benefits seem obvious but they are also wide ranging in the commercial environment especially as aircraft avionics become more complex flight times longer and skies and airports more congested.

Aside from the basic flying telemetry the system can be used to project visual information from sensors in reduced visibility – an obvious benefit when taking off or landing – warning messages air traffic control information and also importantly guidance when negotiating and taxiing busy airports.

“One of the applications we’ve developed is to help give guidance to pilots when they are taxiing in the fog” states Tomlinson. “In that situation you can display guide information for the pilot that can prevent an aircraft leaving the runway and going onto the grass or soft ground which can be a very disruptive event at an airport.”

Stewart Penney business development manager at BAE Systems Electronic Systems adds: “Commercial pilots fly to many different airports. Some may be simple on the ground but others such as Paris Charles de Gaulle are very complicated or pilots may be flying to a busy airport for the first time. Pilots getting lost at airports in situations like this are quite common and can cause major disruption to the network and flight schedules. It’s a problem the industry is aware of so projected guidance from a system like LiteWave can be extremely beneficial to pilots in those circumstances.”

Eyes wide open

Tomlinson also explains that the LiteWave has improved clarity and the widest ‘Eye Motion Box’ on the market meaning the pilot can make greater head and body movements away from the screen before they lose sight of the information. The developers have also significantly reduced the number of components in the system not only reducing weight but also leading to greater reliability.

“We’ve managed an incredibly efficient use of componentry in order to achieve the LiteWave product” Tomlinson asserts. “The clarity is fantastic compared to comparable systems on the market and the reduction in component count makes it very efficient and reliable. In effect there is less to go wrong and that means the mean time between failure (MTBF) rate is greatly improved to 15000 hours.”

BAE Systems estimates the LiteWave will be approximately 20% cheaper than competitor HUD systems - not just due to the initial acquisition cost but also the through life maintainability and ease of installation. A further benefit is that the system has an open architecture thanks to its links with the Open Flight Deck programme.

“Some HUD vendors have devised bespoke interfaces which means their HUD systems will only work with other elements of their equipment such as the display computers or sensors” says Tomlinson. “Having an open architecture means the system is compatible with anything else on the marketplace that uses those common interfaces.”

So it seems with the development of LiteWave head-up displays will be a much more common sight in cockpits around the world.

“We undertook flight safety testing at the end of last year which was very successful and we are now at the stage of taking it through to flight certification” Tomlinson concludes. “We have enough data to be able to go to potential customers ask them to try LiteWave on their platform and if it performs as expected continue to full certification.”

Located in Barnoldswick Pennine Tools Aerospace has a proud and diverse manufacturing history. Over the past 48 years the family-run business has serviced a number of industrial subsectors including general subcontracting medical and furnishings before firmly establishing itself as one of the region’s leading tier one aerospace suppliers throughout the past decade.

“We’ve grown from a single unit with two employees to a multi-area facility with over 50 fulltime employees” begins Pennine Tools’ general manager Richard Craddock. “However it’s really over the past 10 years that things have really started to take off.”

Working directly for a series of multinational OEMs throughout both the civil and defence aerospace sectors including Airbus BAE Systems GE Aviation GKN and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) Pennine Tools has a suite of over 800 contracted parts that can be made to order.

“We specialise in ‘aircraft on ground’ and ‘urgent operation requirement’ work which means we have work to extremely demanding timescales” continues Craddock. “Ultimately if a plane lands and there’s a problem it will be grounded until we can manufacture a new component. As such we have to have utmost faith in our production equipment to ensure we can produce the required component right first time.”

Pennine Tools’ ability to work to such tight timescales stems in part from its long-term partnership with machine tool manufacturer Yamazaki Mazak. Within excess of 20 machines installed at its Lancashire manufacturing facility including models from its Variaxis VCN VTC Nexus and Quick Turn series Mazak has been a mainstay for Pennine Tools for over the past 26 years.

“When I joined the company we were already a number of years into our journey with Mazak” states Craddock. “One of the reasons the partnership has been so successful is the uniformity of the Mazatrol CNC across our entire machine tool portfolio.”

“We have consciously adopted a multi-process function within our workforce whereby any engineer should be able to program and operate any machine tool within the production facility. The challenges of sourcing and retaining talent within the engineering industry are well known so having a common control protocol certainly helps from a training and operation perspective.”

Done in one

With order books growing in line with aircraft build rates in 2016 Pennine Tools invested in its first twin pallet automation system to accompany the purchase of a new Variaxis i-700 multi-tasking machining centre.

Combining 5-axis milling and turning in a single set-up the Variaxis i-700 is able to offer ‘done-in-one’ processing of complex workpieces up Ø850mm. With a large machining envelope and a Ø700mm table it is perfectly aligned to deliver high-accuracy high-speed multi-surface machining from a compact footprint.

“Twin pallet loading allowed us to keep pace with demand by ultimately increasing our output from the same resource” notes Craddock. “It proved so successful that we purchased three more Variaxis machines with twin pallet loading systems over the subsequent three years.

“The Variaxis i-700s really opened a new door for us in terms of capacity to process larger workpieces and having the twin pallet functionality also enabled us to free up more machining time on our VTC-800/30SR vertical machining centres.”

However much like the rest of civil aviation sector Pennine Tools has felt the full force of the Covid-19 pandemic which ground civil aviation work to a halt.

“After the initial lockdowns in March 2020 we didn’t know where we were going to be initially” adds Craddock. “However quite early on we were in contact with the MoD who asked us to ensure we could continue to provide support under any circumstances. This was a challenge in itself let alone in the early stages of a pandemic. However our early adoption of automation systems proved to stand us in very good stead as advice on social distancing continued to change throughout 2020 and 2021.”

Given the size of the company’s 3200m2 machine shop Pennine Tools was quickly able to implement a series of safe and controlled working systems to keep all employees socially distanced throughout lockdown periods.

A multi-manning operation was initiated which resulted in one operator running two machines within a dedicated factory zone with only a limited number of personal being given pre-approved multi-zone access. However the versatility of the four twin pallet machines ensured production levels could keep pace with the levels demanded by the MoD while also keeping the volume of staff on site to a minimum.

“The last two years have undoubtedly been very challenging however the workforce has been and stuck rigidly to the systems we put in place so we’ve been manufacturing uninterrupted throughout” says Craddock. “Ultimately we were very grateful to be able to assist the MoD as that very much kept us operational.”

Working all hours

Pennine Tools’ success navigating this challenging business landscape has been self-evident with the company investing in a further HCN-5000 machining centre in October 2021. Purchased with expansion in mind the new unit’s 15-16-hour running times allows for out-of-hours running further increasing the company’s machining capacity.

Looking to the future Craddock remains pragmatic. “Civil aviation is still recovering from the shutdowns caused by the pandemic and the industry is still not fully back up to speed yet. However there are positive signs on the horizon – during this period we have installed a new NDT treatment and paint facility alongside an additional machining centre the HCN-5000. We have a strong desire to grow further as the market recovers and these actions have allowed us to broaden the range of services we can offer our customers.”

He concludes: “While we are all looking forward it is nice to reflect on our past decisions to automate early. In that regard we very much feel vindicated given how heavily we relied on it during the extended periods of enforced social distancing at our facility. Indeed though technologies such as anti-collision software and offline programming were implemented in response to the pandemic they have become permanent fixtures and will be vital to our continued success as things return to normal.”

Researchers led by Dr. Faheemullah Khan from Aga Khan University Hospital in Pakistan authored the editorial which outlined current scientific knowledge of trans people in breast cancer screening as well as socioeconomic barriers preventing more widespread screening in this community. They also detailed specific concerns about trans breast cancer screening in Pakistan.

""The pervasive stigma about the transgender community is deeply rooted around the globe in all spheres of public life"" Khan et al wrote. ""Health as a fundamental human right was enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 Article 25. However even after more than 70 years communities such as transgenders face the worst form of discrimination while seeking healthcare.""

Less than 1% of the U.S. identifies as being trans though researchers have pointed out that this may be an underestimate due to social stigmas. A majority of trans women use gender-affirming hormones which were found in a 2019 study to increase breast cancer risk by 43 per 100000 person-years. The same study also found that trans women have 46 times higher breast cancer risk than cisgender men and that breast cancer follows a rapid course after a latent period of 18 years of hormone use.

Current guidelines suggest that trans people who have used gender-affirming hormones for over five years should receive mammograms every other year. However screening is not advised for trans people over 50 years old unless they have a history of gender-affirming hormone use. Previous research has shown that screening before 50 has no proven benefit.

Guidelines also suggest that oncologic follow-up is needed if BRCA mutations are found in trans women using gender-affirming hormones. Known cases of BRCA mutation or with a family history of breast cancer require genetic counseling and screening.

Previous research suggests that trans men who have not undergone bilateral mastectomy or who have only undergone breast reduction should still have screening done.

The editorial authors wrote that raising awareness among both clinicians and trans patients is more important than initiating screening at a younger age or enhancing available screening. Studies have shown that trans patients are less likely to seek breast cancer screening than their cisgender counterparts.

They also wrote that mammograms have ""never"" been performed on trans women in Pakistan based on administrative information from major Pakistani hospitals.

""This represents the lack of uniformity in the health care setting resulting in an increase in undiagnosed occurrences of breast cancer among transgenders"" they added.

The authors added that culturally sensitive healthcare tailored to trans people is ""vital"" and gave examples such as the World Health Organization (WHO) supporting incorporating trans health into the standard medical curriculum. A 2022 study the team cited found that healthcare education systems using audits can help drive LGBTQIA+ inclusion and participation in academic settings.

They emphasized that breast cancer is a serious concern in trans people.

""In countries such as Pakistan health care is on the brink therefore caring for transgenders would require revolutionary measures"" the authors wrote. ""It is high time that important steps for breast cancer screening in transgenders are considered.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2Jvc3Rvbi9uZXdzL2RpY2tzLXN0YXJidWNrcy1hbW9uZy1jb21wYW5pZXMtdG8tY292ZXItZW1wbG95ZWVzLWFib3J0aW9uLXJlbGF0ZWQtdHJhdmVsL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9ib3N0b24vbmV3cy9kaWNrcy1zdGFyYnVja3MtYW1vbmctY29tcGFuaWVzLXRvLWNvdmVyLWVtcGxveWVlcy1hYm9ydGlvbi1yZWxhdGVkLXRyYXZlbC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dick's Starbucks among companies to cover employees' abortion-related travel,"BOSTON - After the Supreme Court ruled on Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees — and in some cases their dependents — seeking abortions in states that outlaw the procedure.

The court's decision to roll back the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling which protected the federal constitutional right to an abortion is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America leaving abortion policy up to individual states and paving the way for numerous states to pass new abortion restrictions. As of Friday afternoon state officials in at least seven states said that new abortion bans can now be enforced.

Millions of people seeking abortions could soon be forced to travel across state lines to access the procedure adding to the cost of an already often expensive healthcare service. For many employers' benefit packages may be the only way they can afford an abortion.

In response corporations some with headquarters or offices in Republican-controlled states are taking action. Companies such as Citigroup Salesforce and Match Group first promised financial support to employees seeking abortions in affected states after a draft version of the opinion leaked in May. Many more followed suit on Friday. Some including Bumble and Lyft also previously said they would donate to organizations that support women's rights such as Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice.

Corporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent and worry about the impact these states' anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.

Here are some of the prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.

Microsoft

Microsoft extended its financial support for ""critical healthcare"" including abortions and gender-affirming care to include coverage for travel expenses for such services after the draft opinion overturning Roe was first leaked.

Apple

The company's existing benefits package allows employees to travel out of state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state according to an Apple spokesperson.

Meta

The tech giant intends to offer travel expense reimbursement ""to the extent permitted by law"" for employees seeking out-of-state health care and reproductive services according to a spokesperson. ""We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved"" the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

Yelp

Yelp's existing healthcare plan for U.S. employees pays for women family members and partners to travel out of states with strict abortion laws such as Texas and Oklahoma which ban abortions after 6 weeks.

""This ruling puts women's health in jeopardy denies them their human rights and threatens to dismantle the progress we've made toward gender equality in the workplaces since Roe"" Jeremy Stoppelman co-founder of Yelp said in a statement Friday. ""Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.""

Disney

Disney employees who are unable to access medical care in one location will be given affordable coverage to access the same care in another location according to a company spokesperson. The benefit covers family planning and pregnancy-related decisions.

Uber

Uber's U.S. insurance plans already cover reproductive health benefits including abortion and travel expenses to access healthcare. The rideshare company will also reimburse any drivers sued under state law for providing transportation to a clinic through the app according to an Uber spokesperson.

Netflix

The streaming company offers travel reimbursement coverage for U.S. full-time employees and their dependents who need to travel for healthcare treatments including abortions and gender-affirming care a Netflix spokesperson told CNN. The company provides a lifetime allowance of $10000 per employee (or their dependents) per service.

Bumble

Bumble a female-driven dating app said Friday that it will support its employees' ability to access ""the healthcare services they need"" including abortion care. A Bumble spokesperson added that the company will donate to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

""Abortion is healthcare and healthcare is a human right. We are deeply troubled by the Supreme Court decision"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Match Group

Dating app company Match Group in October established a partnership with Planned Parenthood Los Angeles to provide abortion access for its Texas employees and their dependents. The company is currently considering expanding that benefit to all its U.S. staff including remote employees in states with trigger laws that may soon ban abortions according to a Match spokesperson. Match healthcare plans also help to cover travel and lodging costs for employees who need to travel to receive care the spokesperson said.

Box.com

Box.com will cover employee travel and medical expenses incurred by employees while seeking reproductive services.

Levi Strauss

The denim company said through The Levi Strauss Foundation that it is providing grants to the Center for Reproductive Rights Afiya Center and ARC-Southeast which provides direct assistance to women and communities in need of care. The company previously said that under its benefits plan employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren't included in the company's benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement it said.

Comcast-NBC Universal

Comcast has an existing healthcare travel benefit for all employees that covers up to $4000 per trip up to three trips per year with a maximum coverage cap of $10000 per year. The amount paid out depends on the type of health care procedure but abortion care is covered according to the company.

Warner Bros Discovery

Warner Brothers Discovery which owns CNN on Friday expanded healthcare benefits options to include expenses for employees and their covered family members who need to travel to access abortions and other reproductive care according to a company spokesperson.

Should you wait to buy?,"GPU prices are down to normal levels finally. Exhale take a step back; the GPU shortage is over. But don’t get comfortable for long. I don’t have a crystal ball but it’s a good idea to start planning now if you want one of the best graphics cards.

While prices are lower than they’ve been in nearly two years and next-gen GPUs are on the horizon another potential shortage could mean months more of waiting. And the last five years and two graphics card generations have shown that another boom in crypto could cause inflated prices again.

Isn’t there a better way?

You’d think that after five years and two catastrophic generations that AMD Nvidia and cryptominers would figure out a more elegant solution to mining than buying up a bunch of graphics cards. And they have but one problem causes another to spring up which is a big reason why GPU shortages may be less of an event and more of a cadence.

At the end of 2017 into 2018 the talk was all about Bitcoin. As I’ll dig into later the demand for graphics cards went up as the price of Bitcoin did. The reason? Well GPUs are much better than CPUs for mining which is why they’re often targeted. But Bitcoin miners have an even more efficient tool these days — ASICs or application-specific integrated circuits. As the name implies they are computers optimized for one purposes only — and in this case that’s cryptocurrency mining.

Although it’s easy to gawk at an aspiring miner buying up five or 10 graphics cards much higher prices and shortages come from industrial mining the kind that happens at scale. These miners are largely using ASICs to mine Bitcoin now as opposed to gobbling up graphics cards that offer a much lower return on investment.

Enter Ethereum a cryptocurrency that has joined the ranks of Bitcoin in name recognition. The GPU shortage of 2020 largely came from Ethereum which has the signature trait of being ASIC-resistant. That’s right Ethereum is specifically designed to resist working with ASICs. There are a number of reasons why for the crypto community — decentralization of computing power chief among them — but the important point is that Ethereum works best with GPUs while Bitcoin has largely moved on to ASICs.

And make no mistake: Ethereum was the driving force behind mining-related sales. Ethereum miners spent about $15 billion on GPUs over the past year and a half which is nearly 25% of all GPU sales. One report suggested that a quarter of GPU sales in the first half of 2021 went to miners too.

Regardless of what new cryptocurrencies become popular or if Ethereum ever moves to proof-of-stake it’s clear that graphics cards play a critical role in cryptocurrency mining — and they likely always will. The only way for GPU demand from cryptocurrency miners to go away is for cryptocurrency to go away and that’s not happening any time soon.

Supply chain solved?

The pandemic undoubtedly had an effect of prices but the rapid drop in GPU prices in early 2022 exposes what was supporting such high sustained prices. Just days before $800 billion in cryptocurrency value disappeared from the market in May GPUs dropped by around 15%. And a month later as crypto prices continued to drop GPU prices dropped another 15%.

It’s true that the supply chain issues worsened and prolonged the GPU shortage but we have historical context to see that it wasn’t the supply chain alone. Bitcoin when it was still being mined with GPUs went from around $7000 per coin in November 2017 to nearly $18000 at the beginning of 2018. And during that same period the prices of GPUs nearly doubled. You don’t even need to look that far back to see the correlation. The term “GPU prices” reached it highest-ever search volume (including during the latest GPU shortage) at the beginning of 2018.

And of course there wasn’t a pandemic at that time. The improving supply chain has helped GPU prices drop below MSRP but the mass drop-off in price largely came when Ethereum dropped. It’s been on a steady decline since the beginning of 2021 but it saw its largest dip in May (around 32%) right as GPUs became much more affordable.

Some estimates says the chip shortage won’t be fully over until 2024 and frankly supply chain issues don’t suddenly disappear within a month. The GPU shortages of 2017 and 2020 are complex and based a lot of different factors but the consistent thread between them is crypto and that’s important to keep in mind for next-gen GPUs.

Next-gen on the horizon

If Nvidia and AMD keep up their normal release cadences we expect RTX 40-series and RX 7000 GPUs later this year. Hopefully we won’t experience another GPU shortage but it’s going to come down to the demand from cryptocurrency miners.

Although the shortage in 2017 came on as fiercely as the one in 2020 it didn’t last nearly as long. GPU prices boomed over the course of about six months shortly before crypto flatlined. In 2020 the issues with the supply chain just compounded a similar situation stretching it out over the course of nearly two years.

The last two generations have been marked by distinctly high GPU prices as crypto soars and there’s no reason to think this generation will be any different. The good news is that although we may see higher prices as next-gen GPUs start to roll out we probably won’t find ourselves stuck in two years of GPU hell.

With 9 out of 10 people from Gen Z having a phone in America the countless hours teenagers spend on their phones every day means that teenagers are exposed to a lot more media influence than ever before according to the

.

Rates of depression anxiety and suicide have exploded among teens in recent decades and sleep patterns have also been disrupted. A 2018 Pew Research Study tied social media use to increased connectivity of people to their friends and other strangers but also put pressure on media users to “prove themselves” with comments likes and posts.

Instagram Tiktok and Facebook are some of the most popular social media apps among teens that contribute to these negative trends. According to Columbia Public Health adolescence is a time of growth and self-discovery for teenagers but using social media often twists your self-image and some teenagers begin to lose that sense of self in the impossible standards set by society as amplified by media.

In a Britain study of 84000 people two of the surveys tracked more than 17000 adolescents aged 10 to 21 showing how their social media usage and life satisfaction ratings changed from year to year. The study found that during children’s younger years heavy use of social media correlated to a lower life-satisfaction rating the next year. For girls this age period was between 11 to 13 while for boys it was between 14 and 15.

What’s even worse according to Illinois State University is the fact that on social media people only post the best versions of themselves for others to see which raises a lot of concern for teenagers who instantly set their appearance standards to be like those perfect pictures.

Engaging in photo-heavy activities on social media results in less body acceptance and a heavier obsession with appearance. It leads to many young teenage girls starving themselves and eventually developing an eating disorder simply because of social media’s portrayal of the “perfect” person as thin athletic and good-looking.

So what can we do to protect our younger generation’s future?

Parents and adolescents alike can take initiative and begin setting time restrictions on phone usage. Various software apps released in recent years allow parental control on children’s phones to set time limits on how much screen time is allowed in a day.

The Guardian says that many corporations acknowledge how harmful social media is but refuse to address that issue. Companies and users alike can protect the mental health of adolescent teens by raising awareness about the dangers and negative influences while working actively to address them together.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbW9wYXJpbnNpZGVycy5jb20vZGVzaWduLWEtbW9kZXJuLWRheS1maWZ0aC1nZW4tcmFtLTE1MDAtdHJ4LWJhc2VkLXdhcmxvY2stcGlja3VwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DESIGN: A Modern-Day Fifth-Gen Ram 1500 TRX-Based Warlock Pickup!,"During the late-1970s automakers released a number of marketing campaigns to attract buyers during a time of economic crisis steep gas prices and emission-plagued performance. The Dodge brand released a campaign called “Adult Toys from Dodge” which centered on their full-size truck and van lineups. While many people remember vehicles like the Lil’ Red Express and Macho Power Wagon there was one pickup that became an instant classic with fans at the time: the Warlock.

Originally introduced as a concept vehicle in 1976 the Warlock was aimed at the “urban cowboy” at the time. The concept featured wide tires bucket seats tinted windows chrome-plated running boards oak wood-lined bed oak wood sideboards above the box sides and gold-colored accents that featured pin striping that outline the wheel wells and body lines.

The truck was a big enough success on the auto show circuit that Dodge greenlit a limited production version for the 1976 model year. It then would go on to become a regular production option from 1977 to 1979.

Offered in a trio of colors (Dark Green Metallic Bright Red and Black) the production Warlock was based on the D100 Utiline Regular Cab pickup. It offered an all-black interior and featured even more gold accents on the dash and door panels. Black-painted Warlocks were a favorite among enthusiasts as they gave a large resemblance to that year’s hugely popular movie “Smokey and the Bandit“ as Burt Reynolds’ Bandit character drove a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am in a similar scheme. Warlock was printed in gold on the tailgate through 1978; the 1979 model instead had “Warlock II” printed.

With the introduction of today’s high-performance Ram 1500 TRX the four-door Baja-based off-roader features a 702-horsepower supercharged 6.2-liter HEMI HELLCAT V8 under the hood. While the truck is the pinnacle of performance in the full-size pickup market today the Dodge Truck brand (now called Ram) has focused on the off-road market leaving the street performance pickup market out in the wind (a segment they dominated in the mid-2000s).

While the Warlock name continues to live on as an off-road version of the popular Ram 1500 Classic one digital artist Jim Lord (@jlord8) decided to take inspiration from the original and blend it with the likes of the new TRX. Creating an amazing interpretation of the original even down to the original regular-cab configuration.

Absolutely a stunner it is something like this digital design that Dodge (err Ram) enthusiasts have been waiting for for some time. While it might seem unrealistic in today’s Crew Cab pickup market which is pushing towards electrification it is quite awesome to see what such a vehicle might look like if it was produced in today’s market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9mb3NzaWxfYW5ub3VuY2VzX2dlbl82X2h5YnJpZF9zbWFydHdhdGNoX3dpdGhfdHdvd2Vla19iYXR0ZXJ5X2FuZF9hbGV4YV9zdXBwb3J0LW5ld3MtNTQ4MDQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fossil announces Gen 6 Hybrid smartwatch with two-week battery and Alexa support,"Fossil has unveiled its next-generation Hybrid smartwatch for those who prefer a more classic look with some of the smart features of modern smartwatches.

""Listen I think that every single season you get to a juncture where you're like: 'How can we possibly get away with this?' And this season it became pretty apparent that everything was dialled up"" he said.

""There's more action more drama more heart. And I think it pushed all the departments. Like the makeup department they ran out of fake blood on episode 3 and sperm on episode 6. So it was a challenge for all involved.""

Urban also talked about the collaborative environment on set and how rewarding it is for him as an actor.

The Violent Femmes returned as hometown heroes for the headlining show Friday night at Summerfest on the Generac Power Stage. The alternative rock band known to never disappoint performed with the flair that has defined their showmanship for the past four decades. The audience was huge a mix of diehard fans who have followed the band’s journey and people with an appreciation for all the Femmes stand for and everyone tremendously happy to rock out to the legendary musicians.

Breaking barriers early in their career the show was full of their well-known energy edgy and rebellious. Funky and up-tempo bright and gritty the Violent Femmes brought their nostalgic groove back to the Summerfest stage. The feeling of new and revolutionary remains as strong now as it has throughout their career.

The Violent Femmes arguably the biggest band to come out of Milwaukee performed hits that have withstood the test of time. Enticing and nostalgic people swarmed to hear the songs that defined their generation. At 10 p.m. the cool air and the cool vibe created the perfect atmosphere and electric energy while a sea of Gen Xers jammed out to the music of their youth.

The Violent Femmes demonstrated tremendous versatility each member of the band switching instruments with ease moving through various different types of drums violin and banjo. The overwhelming amount of skill and personality shown through in every aspect of the performance.

Each song brought a choir of audience voices and eagerness to sing along to the well-known tunes. Witnessing the audience connect with the band and each other was nothing short of Milwaukee magic that can only happen at Summerfest. Despite the misstep during “I Danced” the Femmes were regarded with true admiration.

Ending with “Blister in the Sun” the melody of the popular song echoed well beyond the Generac Power Stage. Groovy and funky and playful the Violent Femmes demonstrated the greatness of the alternative rock genre.

Canley Christened at General Dynamics NASSCO San Diego,"Expeditionary sea base USNS John L. Canley (ESB-6) Military Sealift Command’s newest ship was christened during a ceremony at the General Dynamics NASSCO shipyard in San Diego Calif. today.



The event was attended by VIP guests including the Honorable Robert Thompson Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Installations Energy and Facilities; Lt. Gen. Michael Langley commander U.S. Marine Forces Command; Vice Adm. Ross Myers commander U.S. Fleet Cyber Command/10th Fleet; Sgt. Maj. David Wilson Command Sergeant Major 1st Marine Division; Thomas Kiss director Ship Management Military Sealift Command; Captain Austin Hanbury Canley’s civil service master; Jason Briggs Canley’s Chief Engineer the ship’s crew and Sailors from the ships pre-commissioning unit and five Medal of Honor recipients.



The 784 foot ship honors Gunnery Sgt. John L. Canley a United States Marine who distinguished himself in battle during the Viet Nam war in January/February 1968 during the Battle of Huế with Company A 1st Battalion 1st Marines. Canley was originally awarded the Navy Cross but this was upgraded to the Medal of Honor fifty years after the battle making him the first living Black Marine to receive the nation’s highest military decoration for valor. The only previous Black recipients in the Marine Corps who received the medal posthumously.



“If we operate this great ship with a fraction of the skill tenacity and courage displayed by John Canley our naval service will be well-positioned to meet the challenges that lie ahead!” said Kiss during his remarks during the ceremony.



The official christening moment happened when the ship's sponsor Canley’s daughter Patricia Sargent broke a bottle of champagne over the ship’s bow with the words “For the United States of America I christen you the USNS John L. Canley. May God bless this ship and all who sail on her.”



“What we christen today is not just a ship” said Dave Carver president General Dynamics NASSCO. “It is the embodiment of American unity and purpose; a beacon of freedom that will carry John Canley’s legacy and the legacy of America to people all over the world.”



Canley is the sixth ship in the expeditionary mobile base platform build for MSC and the third expeditionary staging base model. When activated Canley will primarily support aviation mine countermeasure and special operations force missions. In addition to the flight deck the ship has a hangar with two aviation operating spots capable of handling MH-53E Sea Dragon-equivalent helicopters; accommodations work spaces and ordnance storage for embarked force; enhanced command control communications computers and intelligence to support embarked force mission planning and execution; and reconfigurable mission deck area to store embarked force equipment to include mine sleds and rigid hull inflatable boats.



“Navy forces are more important than ever in building global security projecting power deterring foes and rapidly responding to crisis that affect our national security. To do that we have to be forward engaged and ready” said Kiss. “This expeditionary sea base will do all those things and much more providing our leadership with options and maneuver space; and supporting the Joint Force through a unique combination of aviation support equipment staging command and control and most importantly a well-trained crew.”



Canley will be delivered to the MSC fleet later this year where it will undergo testing and qualifications in preparation for its support of a variety of maritime-based missions including Special Operations Forces and Airborne Mine Counter Measures support operations humanitarian and traditional military missions.

In 2020 Former Secretary of the Navy Kenneth J. Braithwaite declared that the fourth ship in the ESB program be named after Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. Maj. John L. Canley. Canley rescued more than 20 fellow Marines under enemy fire in Vietnam during the Battle of Huế City in 1968. In addition to the Medal of Honor the nation’s highest honor Canley also receive the Bronze Star with Combat “V” and the Purple Heart.

ESB ships are highly flexible platforms designed to support multiple maritime-based missions including Air Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) Special Operations Forces (SOF) and limited crisis response. Acting as a mobile sea base this 784-foot ship has a 52000 square-foot flight deck to support MH-53 MH-60 MV-22 tilt-rotor and H1 aircraft operations.

(Sandy Huffaker/TNS)

(Tribune News Service) — In February 1968 during a particularly vicious moment in the Vietnam War a virtually unknown Marine from Camp Pendleton did the unthinkable as enemy forces turned their guns his way.

John Canley who had snuck into the service years earlier at age 15 scrambled into the open scaled a wall and guided wounded Marines to safety as close-quarter fire echoed in everyone’s ears.

The gunnery sergeant then scaled the wall a second time saving additional Marines during the Battle of Hue City a blood bath that would lead many Americans to decide that the war in Vietnam was unwinnable.

Decades later Canley was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroics becoming the first living Black Marine to receive the highest medal the nation gives for extraordinary acts of bravery.

On Saturday five weeks after he passed away at 84 he was honored again. This time it was by the Navy which christened a massive vessel in Canley’s name at the General Dynamics-NASSCO shipyard in San Diego during a ceremony that also represented the evolution of the military.

Canley’s named was fixed to an Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) a new type of ship that will help the country deploy troops and equipment in regions where the US doesn’t have easy access to land bases and seaports.

The Navy originally intended a similar but more modest role for ESB’s which are about 2.5 times the length of a football field and weigh about 100000 tons. But the ships have since been cleared to more fully participate in armed conflict.

The vessels are essential to so-called Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) an effort by the Navy and Marines to more widely and wisely spread their forces around the globe including places like the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait where the US is having territorial disputes with China.

“A key part of what the Marines are doing is developing the sort of small forces that can operate in anti-access areas where the Chinese can threaten major military assets” said Professor Tai Ming Cheung a China expert at UC San Diego’s School for Global Policy & Strategy.

“There is this concern that access to allied bases has not been robust in the last decade or so especially in Southeast Asia.”

NASSCO has built four of the mobile sea bases which are designed to do everything from carry out Special Operations missions to airborne mine-countermine activity to manned and unmanned surveillance. It also can repair other ships.

The shipyard is at work on a fifth ESB which will bear the name of Medal of Honor recipient Robert Simanek. And it is likely to build a sixth ship which has yet to be named.

ESBs — which cost about $650 million — feature the third largest flight decks in the Navy. Their assets include V-22 Ospreys which carry amphibious assault troops and H-53E Super Stallions the primary heavy lift helicopter used by the Marines.

The ship’s capabilities were a talking point during Saturday’s christening which was attended by about 350 people including five Medal of Honor recipients. But the focus was on Canley a 6-foot four-inch 240 pound Arkansas native who was known as a quiet deliberate man who never swore.

In a story that has circulated widely over the years Canley joined the Marines in 1953 by using his brother’s credentials when he met with enlistment officers. He served in Japan and South Korea. Then he went to Vietnam where communist forces in the north along with some of its allies in the south fought the South Vietnamese government for political control of the country. U.S. forces supported the South Vietnamese.

The conflict reached a turning point in early 1968 when the North Vietnamese launched the Tet Offensive a broad series of attacks in the South many which caught people off guard because they occurred during the Lunar New Year holiday.

Canley was then a member of Marine Corps First Battalion First Marine Regiment — or Alpha 1/1 as it was called.

The unit composed mostly of teenagers was dispatched to repel invading forces in Hue City which had once been the nation’s imperial capital. Along the way Alpha Company’s captain Gordon Batcheller was killed in battle. Canley stepped in to take his place and risked his own life by exposing himself to gun fire to draw out enemy troops as his team moved toward Hue.

At one point Canley managed to climb up on an enemy stronghold where he dropped a large explosive satchel that went off leading some of the North Vietnamese troops to pull back. Two days later Canley twice scaled the walls at a hospital compound while he was under direct fire and rescued fellow Marines. Over a week he saved more than 20 of his comrades according to the Marines.

“His leadership is what kept us alive” said John Ligato of Jacksonville North Carolina who fought along side Canley in Hue City. “He was so calm self-assured. He never asked us to do anything that he wouldn’t do.”

Canley was awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism. Ligato who went on to become a special agent with the FBI never thought that was enough. It eventually led him and others to pressure the military to take a closer look at what happened at Hue which resulted in Canley getting the Medal of Honor in 2018.

Canley who rose to the rank of sergeant major drew special praise on Saturday from Marine Command Sgt. Major. David Wilson of Fifth Marine Division which operated out of Camp Pendleton until it was deactivated.

“He led from the front he pressed the attack against a determined enemy in fortified positions” Wilson said. “He was wounded. He refused evacuation. He ran across fire swept terrain to save his Marines over and over. He carried them on his back. He fired rounds. He threw satchel charges ... He did all of this in Hue City.”

The last person to speak Saturday was Patricia Sargent of Bend Oregon Canley’s daughter. She tied his service to that of the new ESB.

“To achieve success it comes down to one very simple thing — choice” Sargent said. “The choice we have to be positive. The choice we all have to focus. The choice we all have to have courage ...

“(My father’s) hope is that every crew member every captain that runs this ship makes that choice.”

What about future tanks? Certainly questions about composite materials heavy armor and mobility persist as the U.S. Army contemplates its approach to future armored platforms. At the moment the service seems deeply immersed in a two-pronged approach meaning it is both sustaining and upgrading its heavily armored platforms such as the Abrams tank while also exploring concepts for lighter-weight more mobile and expeditionary armored attack vehicles. There will likely be a place for both as militaries around the world seek to achieve the optimal balance.

The question is now getting a flurry of new attention following Rheinmetall's release of its new KF51 Panther tank a new vehicle deliberately named after the famous WWII German Panzers. The new tank unveiled recently at the well-known Eurosatory military trade show in France features a host of technologies now generating attention such as a larger 130mm cannon the ability to launch drones top-down protection and 360-degree sensors. The vehicle is reported to be lighter than the seventy-ton Abrams tank at fifty-nine tons and incorporates a crew of three with an autoloader for ammunition.

An interesting write-up in Popular Mechanics details many of the technologies built into the new Panther which also incorporates a new generation of digital computing active protection systems and composite materials. The Popular Mechanics article says the turret is “edgier” and more angled but that the main chassis is similar in configuration to the legacy German Leopard 2 tank.

Naturally many are likely to compare the modern Panther with the most current variants of the Abrams tank such as the M1A2 SEP v3 and v4. Does the new German Panther represent a paradigm-changing improvement above upgraded tanks such as the Abrams?

The Abrams could be called an “organic” platform meaning instead of being static in a certain technological position the platform can continuously be upgraded. Today the Abrams is almost an entirely new vehicle when compared to the original design which emerged in the 1980s. Like the German Panther the Abrams does have an autoloader for ammunition and General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) developers say future upgrades to the Abrams will be engineered with the ability to swap out or exchange its 120mm cannon for a 130mm cannon making it comparable in ability to the Panther.

“We may keep the Abrams forever” Mai. Gen. Ross Coffman director Next Generation Combat Vehicle Army Futures Command told The National Interest about ongoing upgrades to the Abrams. The platform has proven both combat capable and upgradeable.

It is not clear yet that the new German KF51 Panther would out-perform the U.S. Army’s M1A2 SEP v3 or emerging v4 variant. The M1A2 SEP v4 builds upon some of the innovations woven into the v3 including a third-generation forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor upgraded thermal sights meteorological sensors and advanced navigational technology such as mapping sensing and multi-node networking which have improved the tank’s ability to maneuver in urban environments. Should a bridge or narrow area present restrictions for an Abrams advanced networking location data and mapping might quickly calculate new alternative transport routes. The Abrams v3 is now operational with forward Army units senior service leaders say.

Public documents and comments from senior U.S. Army weapons developers explain that the next-generation Abrams tank incorporates several paradigm-changing technologies. For example U.S. Army and General Dynamics Land Systems weapons developers don’t say much about what kind of top-down protection the modern Abrams has for security reasons yet its technical composition is such that it can integrate cutting-edge active protection systems and launch drones. The technology for a “hemispheric” 360-APS system existed years ago and was explored for Future Combat Systems so it seems unrealistic that an equivalent would not exist today. Innovations related to APS have been ongoing for many years and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. One past system called QuickKill developed for the U.S. Army’s FCS incorporated 360-degree or hemispheric protections. The program did not continue yet the point is the technical capacity to integrate “surround” intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance has been here for years and is of course fundamental to the F-35 stealth fighter’s Distributed Aperture System.

Overall the kinds of technology used for APS have been on the Abrams for many years as GDLS developers were able to integrate the Trophy APS system into the Abrams network. This was made possible by common standards and open architecture engineering a trend that GDLS engineers have continued through the newest v4 Abrams variant. AI-enabled sensing fire control and intercept technology are some of the few technical areas that have progressed very quickly.

Now they must come equipped with complex communications systems radars lasers jammers and other electronic systems turning battlefield rides into mobile power stations.

European vehicle makers have been quick to jump on the business case for electric propulsion offering products that promise to satisfy militaries’ needs for more efficient energy storage quieter motors and lower thermal signatures. Last week they showed their latest and greatest tech on the floor of the biennial Eurosatory trade conference held outside Paris.

But while the civilian vehicle world has successfully deployed hybrid and electric cars onto city streets the defense sector — now able to take advantage of those civilian technological advances— is just getting started.

Industry leaders told Defense News how the rhetoric around hybrid and all-electric vehicles particularly tactical versions has shifted over the past few years as nations balance increasingly augmented energy needs against rising fuel prices while also tackling challenges brought on by climate change within their services.

Nexter has been working on hybrid technology for about 20 years said Sebastien Roy the company’s energy research and technology leader. The French firm developed an initial hybrid demonstrator from 2003 to 2004 — not in response to a specific requirement but merely to begin evaluating the technology Roy said in an interview at Nexter’s pavilion.

Since then the company has been able to take advantage of the new hybrid propulsion technologies under development in the civil vehicle industry some of which are more compact and capable especially when it comes to batteries. “It’s really those technological evolutions in the civil world that have allowed us to say: ‘OK we will soon be able to integrate them into military vehicles’ ” Roy said.

The rhetoric around electric and hybrid tactical vehicles at the convention center was much louder than what attendees heard at the same show four years ago. Demonstrators were spread across the corners of the show floor from Arquus’ Scarabee light armored vehicle with a fully hybrid powertrain to FFG’s bright-blue eight-wheel drive Genesis armored personnel carrier.

FFG developed the Genesis demonstrator purely to examine the possibilities of a hybrid system on a tank said Michael Moller the German company’s vice president for special technology.

Engineers wanted to “have the knowledge to be … a very early one on the market to know how to handle this technology high-voltage systems how to build it to maintain it” he told Defense News at the company’s booth. The Genesis was developed five years ago and debuted at an FFG event in 2021 he added.

French company Texelis displayed a full-scale model of its four-wheel drive MR400 armored vehicle at its booth which features a new in-wheel electric-hub drive developed jointly with U.K.-based QinetiQ. The MR400 is derived from Texelis’ vehicle design for the French Army’s VBMR Serval multirole vehicle program. Texelis — which was part of the Volvo Group until 2008 — and Nexter are co-prime contractors for the program.

When the Serval design was undergoing development four years ago Texelis was already thinking about integrating a hybrid propulsion system said Sebastien Guillon the company’s export sales director. While no one has requested that requirement talks are ongoing and Texelis is “already thinking about what the configuration will be” he told Defense News at the conference. “What we understood is that it should be something very quick” to integrate and install onto a future Serval vehicle he added.

Meanwhile General Dynamics European Land Systems introduced a fully electric version of its four-wheel drive DURO all-terrain tactical vehicle at the conference. The DURO-e features a variable powertrain that includes a diesel engine and a pure electric powertrain that comes in either a battery- or fuel cell-powered version along with capabilities including silent drive boost and extended silent watch per the company. The DURO-e claims a low heat and noise signature along with high-energy efficiency and a self-sufficient energy supply.

General Dynamics partnered with Magna Powertrain’s Austria-based Engineering Center-Steyr and Switzerland-based Phi-Power AG to produce DURO-e the company said in a news release. The original DURO was designed for the Swiss military.

Rheinmetall also is evaluating hybrid and electric technologies for its future vehicles company officials said at the show. On the sidelines of its pavilion at Eurosatory the German firm set up a space it called the Technology Cube designed for discussions about future vehicle requirements with existing and potential customers. Delegations could be seen moving in and out of the space including senior leaders of the Hungarian army which committed to procuring Rheinmetall’s Lynx infantry fighting vehicle.

The French Army’s hybrid future

The French Armed Forces Ministry has particularly focused on finding solutions for more efficient energy storage as military vehicles are increasingly used for more electronic capabilities such as communications systems lasers radars and jammers.

Former Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly oversaw the release of the ministry’s first defense and energy strategy in 2020  and several months ago released the first defense and climate change strategy . The recommendations in those documents include a hybrid vehicle demonstrator based on the Griffon light armored vehicle meant to complete testing by 2025 and inform future hybrid truck requirements.

Arquus Nexter and Thales are jointly developing the hybrid demonstrator and the team is undergoing testing evaluation and integration efforts that will help the ministry decide whether to launch large-scale production according to an Arquus spokesperson.

The French Army’s future program to build a new armored engagement support vehicle dubbed VBAE may include a requirement for hybrid propulsion. Arquus pitched a hybrid light armored vehicle likely based on its Scarabee light reconnaissance vehicle in anticipation of that requirement the spokesperson said. The Scarabee vehicle debuted in 2018 and was developed to respond to what Arquus thought could be the VBAE requirements and to reflect the company’s vision of what a next-generation reconnaissance vehicle could look like the spokesperson added.

Nexter which has employed hybrid propulsion on its robotic systems already is also exploring the technology for its own submission to the VBAE program Roy said. It expects to have a demonstrator ready around 2025.

Soframe a subsidiary of the French group Lohr revealed last year its planned submission for the VBAE program which will also undergo designs to integrate a fully electric or hybrid propulsion mode according to local reports .

The future Main Ground Combat System — a tank in development by France and Germany — might also feature hybrid propulsion technology. KNDS the joint holding company that includes Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and France’s Nexter is developing the tank that is expected to be fielded around 2035. Arquus is a subcontractor on that program.

Technical challenges

One ongoing challenge relates to the cooling system of a hybrid vehicle which makes it difficult to integrate hybrid propulsion into military applications Nexter’s Roy noted. But as this technology matures in the civilian world the company imagines being able to overcome this problem in the near future.

Energy storage also remains a challenge. “Batteries are changing very fast” said FFG’s Moller. Developing batteries that have better performance and are lighter and more easily replaceable will be key moving forward he added.

Some stakeholders noted that the market for hybrid military vehicles remains limited. The demonstrators on the Eurosatory show floor were overwhelmingly tactical vehicles and officials may not be ready to expand their interest in hybrid technologies beyond those capabilities industry leaders noted.

Sweden’s Volvo has been developing hybrid and electric vehicles for nearly two decades now primarily to serve its customers in the civilian sector. Its defense subsidiary focuses on heavy vehicles such as logistics trucks that drive over extended distances.

So far while officials are expressing interest in alternative fuel solutions there has been little demonstrable effort to actually “hybridize” those types of vehicles for the military Andreas Svenungsson head of Volvo Defense told Defense News at Eurosatory.

For now tactical vehicles appear to have the best use case scenario for hybrid or electric propulsion vehicles due to the operational benefits of quieter motors and lower thermal signatures he noted. But for the vehicles Volvo produces “we have not seen it [hybrid or electric propulsion] in the tenders or the requirements so far” he added.

He also noted that military programs have the added considerations of maintaining a secure supply chain and steady access to fuel that remain challenges for the hybridization of ground vehicles.

But thanks to Volvo’s ongoing electric and hybrid propulsion efforts for civilian trucks and buses “if they want to procure this for the defense segment we are ready” he added.

It was clear to these companies that the drumbeat for hybrid military vehicles is only getting louder. Years ago officials were talking about the possibility of hybrid vehicles but without any “real requirements” noted Texelis’ Guillon.

“Now I think they have a clear vision” spurred by environmental targets or the need for “silent mode” capabilities and energy storage he said. “It will help us because the way we want to develop something it should be useful for the customer and not just be hybrid by name.”

10 Ice Cream Cones

VINTAGE 80’S ICE CREAM CONES CEREAL COMMERCIAL

In 1986 General Mills decided that if parents could serve their children cookies for breakfast they might as well serve them ice cream. So what did they do? They created ice cream cone cereal that was nothing short of gross. The breakfast food came in two flavors: chocolate and chocolate chip.

It’s fair to say these cereals didn’t live long enough to see the light of day. They were discontinued the same year they debuted. Parents couldn’t stand the idea of serving their children ice cream for breakfast. What seemed like a great idea from the start turned out to be a miscalculated move.

There were plans to bring the ice cream cones back in 2003 but that also failed. Today we can only remember Ice Cream Cones as one of the grossest cereals that melted before consumers ate it.

9 Cupcake Pebbles

The classic Fruity Pebbles and Cocoa Pebbles are a true staple in many homes. But thankfully Cupcake Pebbles bit the dust. Popular between 2010 and 2011 Cupcake Pebbles came in boxes scripted with words sweeter than the cereals themselves. “Good old wholesome sweetened rice cereal with artificial flavor.” Yikes! If you’re going to inadvertently sell artificial flavors you don’t advertise them.

Cupcake Pebbles were so bad that even Barney and Fred weren’t touching them. Their kids Bamm-Bamm and Pebbles were the chosen cereal box character reps. It doesn’t matter if you loved or hated this cereal. There’s one thing we can agree on—that slogan is just poor marketing.





8 Batman Cereal

Everything about the Batman cereal was iconic. From the bat-inspired shapes to having an iconic superhero name Batman cereal was destined for greatness… except for its awful taste.

The first few months after its release saw tremendous sales with the inclusion of a plastic Batman collectible bank. Children everywhere nagged their parents to buy them the Dark Knight’s breakfast cereal and they did.

However the cereal’s “greatness” started and ended with its shape. It turns out that the “natural honey nut flavor” described on the box couldn’t convince consumers. They tasted nothing like their overhyped commercial promises which prompted a backlash that led to its cancellation in 1990.

I guess you just can’t beat the Honey Nut Cheerios invented back in the ’70s.

7 Nickelodeon Green Slime Cereal

Speaking of the ’70s the Nickelodeon channel started late in this decade as well. Still it wasn’t until the early ’80s that it hit the ground running. One of the shows aired on the network was You Can’t Do That on Television. Here participants would participate in trivia and whenever someone mentioned the word “water” they would have water poured on their heads.

Here is where it gets interesting whenever someone said “I don’t know” they would have slime poured on their head. Despite being a simple gimmick the challenge was exciting since nobody in the show was immune to it.

Following the show’s popularity Nickelodeon decided to create and sell slime-related products including Green Slime cereal. In a partnership with General Mills in 2003 Nickelodeon introduced the first batch of Green Slime cereal to the public to promote the upcoming Kids’ Choice Awards.

There was just one problem: the cereal was nothing close to the show’s success that inspired it. Besides the awful taste the smell and color alone were just about how you’d imagine slime. Not very appetizing. It wasn’t long before Nickelodeon’s cereal was off the shelves to pave the way for other healthier sweeter and less disgusting cereals.

The Sour Patch Kids cereal was so awful that there was no official announcement about its discontinuation. If you’ve been wondering where it went now you have your answer! While many factors contributed to the rainbow sugar pellets’ cancellation one thing was constant: they were definitely considered a “novelty” cereal.

Sour Patch Kids cereal had appetizing and alluring commercials that many people loved. But most families wouldn’t dare eat the cereal every day. Ironically they were named “Sour” Patch Kids cereal yet contained a whopping 40% sugar. And anybody who wants to live more than 40 years would most likely avoid that kind of sugar content.

Yet somehow the cereal wasn’t really that sweet at all. You know a product has failed when its commercials are sweeter than the cereal.

5 Nintendo Cereal System

If you are a Super Mario super fan you might have heard about the Nintendo Cereal System produced by Ralston Cereals in 1988. The cereal had its basis in two of the most popular video games at the time: The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros.

However as with many other franchise-inspired kinds of cereal the Nintendo Cereal System didn’t last long thanks (again) to its terrible flavor.

Of course the first few months saw tremendous sales. But it was only because Super Mario fans wanted a cereal to match their favorite game. It didn’t take long for people to discover that the cereal was essentially a red turtle shell knocking them off track during the most important meal of the day.

The flavor was so bad that it led to its discontinuation but that didn’t stop super fans from hunting down this lost piece of history. The cereal has been sold as memorabilia for collectors over the years. One box was sold for over $200 but there’s no way someone paid that much for the flavor.





4 Urkel-Os

The Urkel-Os was a super sweet strawberry and banana-flavored cereal that millennials loved but Gen Z found repulsive. This breakfast meal was inspired by the sitcom Family Matters a popular show aired throughout the ’90s.

The cereal paid homage to Urkel the quirky yet lovable nerd who often donned shirts similar in color to the cereal created in his image. Unlike the other nasty cereals we’ve covered Urkel-Os managed to appear on many breakfast tables before being exposed as a cereal wannabe. The taste just couldn’t keep up with other circular-shaped brands like Froot Loops.

I guess Urkel can still say “Did I do that?”

3 Banana Frosted Flakes

This pick is likely to spark a debate. But yes many people found the Banana Frosted Flakes to be terrible. I’m not surprised that Kellogg discontinued the flavor. The idea of having actual bananas built into your breakfast was cool. But the bananas in the Banana Frosted Flakes were crunchy and extra sweet which if you’ve ever had a real banana is a little disconcerting.

The cereal was introduced in 1981 and it wasn’t long before the brand canceled it in 1984. Recently though Kellogg introduced the Banana Crème Frosted Flakes which in my opinion are better than the original ones. Who knows? Maybe this version will be around longer.

Wrestler and actor Laurence “Mr. T” Tureaud was trendy in the ’80s. He played critical roles in the TV series The A-Team<.em> (1983–1987) and the film Rocky III (1982) making him even more popular. In fact he was so famous that Mt. T cereal was introduced to feed the ever-hungry Mr. T fraternity.

The cereal assumed the shape of the letter “T” to symbolize the great actor’s prowess. However the cereal’s taste wasn’t as great as the person who inspired it. Since this cereal was universally considered inedible by many it was canceled shortly after it was released.

Even the cereal’s memorable appearance in the film Pee Wee’s Big Adventure didn’t save it from discontinuation. From its creation to production and marketing it was destined for success but I guess they forgot to do a taste test.

Maybe this time we really can pity the fool… who purchased this awful cereal.

1 Frute Brute

FRUIT BRUTE! The First one!

Frute Brute was introduced in 1974 but was canceled in 1982. It was a frosted cherry-flavored version of Monster Cereal with a werewolf mascot. General Mills is among the industry’s heavy hitters but with this particular cereal they got their calculations all wrong.

Frute Brute was nothing short of a total disaster and it’s only by chance that it managed to stay on the shelves for as long as it did. If anything the cereal was only popular because of its numerous film appearances that became memorable. This cereal had cameos in classic films like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.

But its sales were a work of pulp fiction too. Cherry cereal?

They were embraced by some of Minnesota's largest employers as well as a group of Democratic heavyweights who welcomed the crowds with a plea for political action in response to recent moves that they said threaten the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community.

Wade noting that Justice Clarence Thomas proclaimed that the legal rationale for banning abortion should be used to overturn cases establishing rights to contraception same-sex consensual relations and same-sex marriage. The speakers urged attendees to get out and vote this fall for people who support their causes.

""They are coming for equality"" said Gov. Tim Walz who also marched in the parade next to Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan. ""They are coming for all of our rights. The good news is there's more of us. … The antidote to what we saw on Friday is you. It is all of our responsibility to create a world where every single child is seen heard loved and valued. Minnesota is that place.""

Andrea Jenkins president of the Minneapolis City Council warned the crowd that more than 300 anti-LGBTQ laws have been introduced throughout the U.S. recently with more than 100 of them passing in various states. She said conservatives are trying to legislate the LGBTQ community ""out of societal existence.""

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said the LGBTQ community has shown that it has political muscle of its own.

""Fifty years ago did we think we were going to have gay marriage? We did not"" Klobuchar told the crowd. ""Did we think we were going to get rid of things like 'Don't ask don't tell'? We did not. We have made so much progress. … This is a celebration of 50 years of progress but it is also a call for action for 50 more.""

Many crowd members said they welcomed the intrusion of politics on a day devoted to spreading messages of love inclusion and acceptance.

Pam Burd who has been coming to the Pride parade for 20 years said it was important for state leaders to show support for the LGBTQ community.

""I'm pretty disturbed by recent events"" said Burd who identifies as a gay woman. ""And I don't know what our future is. So I think our leaders need to be involved in everything that's going on.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was the most energetic politician on hand jogging down the route in shorts and pumping up the crowd outside Rock Bottom Brewery. In a call-and-responses session Frey shouted ""Happy!"" and the jubilant crowd shouted back ""Pride!""

Same-sex couples exchanged kisses and hugs sometimes on the route itself. The Timberwolves mascot drew huge cheers with his dance routine to Aretha Franklin's ""Respect."" The crowd also went delirious for bubbles and people sang along to a variety of hits.

""It was awesome"" said Tasia Desjarlait who brought her four kids to the parade for the first time. ""I feel great because the people going to the parade today feel free.""

Police said turnout was as large as before the pandemic. They reported no arrests or incidents related to the parade though a group of about 100 anti-police protesters briefly disrupted the beginning of the parade as they chanted ""No police at Pride"" and ""No justice no peace."" The group quickly moved to Loring Park organizers said.

The parade was an entertaining spectacle that lasted slightly more than two hours. Though it did not reach Mardi Gras levels there was a lot of exposed skin even though the weather never topped 70 degrees. One marcher wore nothing but a pair of white jockey shorts as he gyrated down Hennepin Avenue.

Still the parade was a fairly family-friendly event. Madusa Rose set up a face-painting station at 9th and Hennepin treating about 40 children to a free butterfly or other design. Rainbows symbolizing the LGBTQ flag were everywhere: on socks shirts capes dresses suits beads dogs — even rainbow-dyed hair.

Pat Meyer brought his three kids to the parade from St. Louis Park for the first time this year saying he did it to support his 13-year-old daughter who recently told the family she identifies as ""pansexual.""

""It opens up a lot of dialogues for us"" Meyer said while his two younger sons showed off their rainbow-colored gear. ""It's important for them to see there are no limitations to who you are.""

The parade drew some of Minnesota's biggest companies. A crew from Cargill carried signs saying ""We don't give a moo who you love"" and ""Labels are for jars not people."" Xcel Energy marched under a banner saying ""You. Us. Together."" Aveda workers wore T-shirts saying ""Be you. Do you.""

It's called ""shrinkflation"" which according to consumer expert Edgar Dworsky's blog mouseprint.org is when products ""have shrunken in size as a sneaky way for manufacturers to pass on a hidden price increase.""

Sumit Vakil Chief Product Officer and co-founder of supply chain risk management company Resilinc says that the practice of shrinkflation is becoming more common across the market. ""Everywhere we are seeing businesses and ultimately consumers paying more for goods or getting less; especially for anything in short supply and high demand…Some companies are implementing supply chain surcharges in the form of an additional 'hidden' layered fee on top of other costs or a flat-out price increase.""

Additionally he says that ""there may not be a price increase but the package sizing or quantity is smaller. You may have noticed this with food products in particular: cereal pasta snacks etc. Even the little cups that you pump ketchup into at your local fast food restaurant are now smaller.""

Depending on the company's approach you may not be aware that the box of pasta you buy every week is getting smaller. Vakil says ""Some are more stealth about it and others are going to come right out and say it.""

But no matter how concealed the price hike consumers are certainly noticing. There's an entire subreddit dedicated to recognizing when products have been zapped by the shrink ray. This community along with Dworsky keeps track of items where consumers are being shortchanged. And here are six of the most pervasive ""shrinkflation"" offenders.

These Are Costco's Most Popular Items Right Now

Cereal

Back in November 2021 General Mills' family-size cereal boxes suffered a 1.2-ounce loss…and now Cocoa Pebbles and Quaker Life have followed suit. In June Dworsky wrote that a box of Cocoa Puffs had ""about a bowl"" less cereal and Life dropped 2.5 ounces. On that note you may consider putting a few new easy and healthy breakfast ideas into your rotation.

Huggies Diapers

Adding to the financial challenges that parents are facing lately the count on these baby necessities is now being slimmed down according to Redditors. A few of the victims: Snug & Dry Little Snugglers and Little Movers. The Snug & Dry used to offer 100 diapers but new boxes with similar branding showed a 12% cutback. Reddit user u/RapMastaC1 commented about the packaging ""They know exactly what they're doing making the qty smaller hoping people will just buy based on the box looking the same.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Folgers Coffee

A particularly devious bait-and-switch: the newest edition of Folgers Classic Roast Instant Coffee comes in a 9.6-ounce container nearly two ounces lighter than last month's according to a Reddit post. The two packages are identical both even claiming to make the same amount of coffee which most commenters conclude seems unlikely: ""They are getting more out of each bean now. If you believe them.""

Paper Goods

Paper towels toilet paper and tissues are frequently decreased in size removing a small number of sheets without tipping off most customers. For example according to Dworsky Kleenex recently cut back five sheets for every Ultra Soft tissue box and Sparkle reduced its paper towel roll by six sheets.

It may not seem like a lot but the missing few become more noticeable over time especially with the cycles of downsizing year after year. Charmin Super Mega Toilet Paper now has only 366 sheets even though it had 396 earlier this year. For reference of how the typical toilet paper roll has changed over the decades Dworsky wrote ""Keep in mind the original single-ply Charmin of the 1960s had 650 sheets on a roll.""

Angel Soft suffered an even worse blow with the Mega Roll going from 425 to 320 sheets per roll – while prices stayed the same.

Laundry Detergent

Dworsky also took note of the newest packaging for Arm & Hammer detergent which claims that 67.5 ounces can clean the same 50 loads of laundry as the previous jug of 75 ounces. It's difficult to understand how this could be the case. Perhaps we were using too much detergent in the first place?

Pedigree Dog Food

The ""bonus size"" package of Pedigree Grilled Steak & Vegetable Flavor dog food shrank Dworksy found from 50 pounds to just 44. Even more bold of the company – including branding that says that the smaller bag comes with an additional 1-lb free compared to the larger bag. It's not a deal it's just shrinkflation.

Filed on June 20th 2022 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office the application is assigned serial number 97466832. The application was filed under multiple Goods and Services categories including for “land vehicles and parts thereof” such as engine components vehicle interior components decals radios and more.

Based on this trademark filing it seems as though GM may be considering launching a restoration division or program for vintage cars. GM Restoration could be the name of a new restoration division that will professionally restore vintage GM vehicles or it may be for a new line of officially licensed repair and/or replacement parts for GM products that are no longer being produced. This program could be particularly appealing to owners or fans of notable vintage GM vehicles like the Chevy Corvette and Camaro or certain Cadillac products.

One of Chevy’s rivals in the sports car segment Porsche already has a vintage restoration program for its old vehicles. The German marque operates the Porsche Classic Factory Restoration facility out of its Experience Center in Atlanta where vintage Porsche vehicle owners can take their vehicle to have it professionally restored. Only Porsche Classic Genuine Parts are used in the restoration process at this facility while the technicians use original technical manuals and specifications as well as original techniques to complete the job. We could see a similar service being appealing to vintage Corvette or Camaro owners as well as a GM equivalent to the Porsche Classic Genuine Parts catalog.

General Motors Refiles for ZORA Trademark - Corvette: Sales News & Lifestyle,"Photo Credit: General Motors



General Motors has moved once again to protect the name ZORA by reregistering it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The trademarked name would be used for “motor land vehicles namely automobiles.”

Corvette enthusiasts know the name refers to the iconic first chief engineer of the Corvette Zora Arkus-Duntov who pushed the Corvette to compete against the world and advocated the move to a mid-engine configuration for the American sports car as far back as the fifties.

The new trademark was filed on June 20 2022:



This is the third time that GM has registered the ZORA name. It first received the rights to the name via an assignment back in 2014 and then it was reregistered again in December 2018. Since that second filing GM got busy and registered ZORA in a number of markets around the world including the United Kingdom the European Union China Australia Japan and a multitude of other nations.

The C8 ZORA has long been rumored to be the top dog in the C8 lineup. It will take the twin-turbo version of the LT7 5.5L DOHC and will also be equipped with an AWD hybrid-electric drivetrain with drive motors on the front wheels much like is expected with the E-Ray. Unlike the E-Ray the ZORA could generate a combined 1000 horsepower with 1000 lb-ft of torque. We could also see the addition of Active Aerodynamics while the body would be the widest and wildest to date.

When the ZORA will arrive is anyone’s guess but if we go by the expected rollout of a new model for each year once the 2023 Corvette Z06 is launched that could mean 2026 at the earliest behind the 2024 E-Ray and the arrival of the 2025 ZR1.

Throwing a wrench in those launch plans could be the Grand Sport a model which appeared in both previous generations after being one-year special editions back in 1996 and 1963. General Motors reregistered the trademark for the Grand Sport name just last month and the name has rich historical opportunities should GM go that route with the E-Ray the GT3 racing platform now under development or a completely different car that slots somewhere in the lineup.

Lauren S. Wood 33 of Washington D.C. pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge John Michael Vazquez to an information charging her with securities fraud.

Lauren Wood

Stemming from the same alleged conduct Usama Malik also of Washington D.C. was previously charged in a three-count indictment with insider trading securities fraud and securities fraud conspiracy.

According to U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger documents filed in this case and statements made in court Malik was the chief financial officer of a New Jersey-based biopharmaceutical company listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange from 2018 through October 2020.

The former CFO spent nearly four years at Immunomedics helping steer the company to a $21 billion buyout by Gilead Sciences Inc. back in 2020 is accused of sharing insider information with his then-girlfriend and a number of relatives.

According to her LinkedIn profile Wood was senior director and head of Patient Experience at Immunomedics for one year between 2018 and 2019.

On April 6 2020 the company publicly announced for the first time that its breast cancer drug – an antibody-based drug designed to treat certain breast cancer patients who had very limited treatment options beyond chemotherapy – had proven effective in pre-market clinical trials.

In October 2020 another biopharmaceutical company—Gilead—acquired Immunomedics for $88.00 per share in cash or approximately $21 billion.

The transaction was unanimously approved by both the Gilead and Immunomedics boards of directors

Malik was among the first and one of the few employees who received the material non-public information about the breast cancer drug before the public announcement.

Within minutes of obtaining that information Malik passed it along to Wood who lived with Malik at the time and was formerly employed by the same company.

Before April 6 2020 and within hours of receiving the insider information from Malik Wood placed an order for approximately 7000 shares of the company’s stock despite the fact that during the same time period the company’s stock was downgraded by financial experts.

Immunomedics received a double downgrade to sell from an analyst at Goldman Sachs who cited a report by the Food and Drug Administration that found new quality control issues at the company’s manufacturing site.

Shares of the Morris Plains New Jersey-based company declined 12.35% to $9.34.

After the company announced that its cancer drug had proven effective in pre-market clinical trials its stock price increased.

After selling her shares Wood more than doubled her investment realizing gross profits of $213618.

The securities fraud charge to which Wood pleaded guilty carries a potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine.

Wood’s sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 21 2022. Sellinger said the charges and allegations against Malik are merely accusations and he is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil complaint on Dec. 1 2021 based on the same conduct.

Soaring fuel bills. Wages that are not keeping pace. Inflation is plundering people’s wallets sparking a wave of protests and workers’ strikes around the world.

This week alone saw protests by the political opposition in Pakistan nurses in Zimbabwe unionized workers in Belgium railway workers in Britain Indigenous people in Ecuador hundreds of U.S. pilots and some European airline workers. Sri Lanka’s prime minister declared an economic collapse Wednesday after weeks of political turmoil.

Economists say Russia’s war in Ukraine amplified inflation by further pushing up the cost of energy and prices of fertilizer grains and cooking oils as farmers struggle to grow and export crops in one of the world’s key agricultural regions.

As prices rise inflation threatens to exacerbate inequalities and widen the gap between billions of people struggling to cover their costs and those who are able to keep spending.

“We are not all in this together” said Matt Grainger head of inequality policy at antipoverty organization Oxfam. “How many of the richest even know what a loaf of bread costs? They don’t really they just absorb the prices.”

Oxfam is calling on the Group of 7 leading industrialized nations which are holding their annual summit this weekend in Germany to provide debt relief to developing economies and to tax corporations on excess profits.

“This isn’t just a standalone crisis. It’s coming off the back of an appalling pandemic that fueled increased inequality worldwide” Grainger said. “I think we will see more and more protests.”

The demonstrations have caught the attention of governments which have responded to soaring consumer prices with support measures like expanded subsidies for utility bills and cuts to fuel taxes. Often that offers little relief because energy markets are volatile. Central banks are trying to ease inflation by raising interest rates.

Meanwhile striking workers have pressured employers to engage in talks on raising wages to keep up with rising prices.

Eddie Dempsey a senior official with Britain’s Rail Maritime and Transport Union which brought U.K. train services to a near standstill with strikes this week said there are going to be more demands for pay increases across other sectors.

“It’s about time Britain had a pay rise. Wages have been falling for 30 years and corporate profits have been going through the roof” Dempsey said.

Last week thousands of truckers in South Korea ended an eight-day strike that caused shipment delays as they called for minimum wage guarantees amid soaring fuel prices. Months earlier some 10000 kilometers (6200 miles) away truckers in Spain went on strike to protest fuel prices.

Peru’s government imposed a brief curfew after protests against fuel and food prices turned violent in April. Truckers and other transport workers also had gone on strike and blocked key highways.

Protests over the cost of living ousted Sri Lanka’s prime minister last month. Middle-class families say they’re forced to skip meals because of the island nation’s economic crisis prompting them to contemplate leaving the country altogether.

The situation is particularly dire for refugees and the poor in conflict areas such as Afghanistan Yemen Myanmar and Haiti where fighting has forced people to flee their homes and rely on aid organizations themselves struggling to raise money.

“How much for my kidney?” is the question most asked of one of Kenya’s largest hospitals. Kenyatta National Hospital reminded people on Facebook this week that selling human organs is illegal.

For the middle class in Europe it’s become more expensive to commute to work and put food on the table.

“Increase our salaries. Now!” chanted thousands of unionized workers in Brussels this week.

“I came here to defend the purchasing power of citizens because demonstrating is the only way to make change” protester Genevieve Cordier said. “We cannot cope anymore. Even with two salaries ... both of us are working and we cannot get our head above water.”

In some countries a combination of government corruption and mismanagement underpin the economic turmoil particularly in politically gridlocked countries like Lebanon and Iraq.

The protests reflect a sense of growing financial insecurity. Here’s how that has played out in Africa:

— Health care professionals in Zimbabwe went on strike this week after rejecting the government’s offer of a 100% pay rise. The nurses say the offer does not come close to skyrocketing inflation of 130%.

— Kenyans have protested in the streets and online as the price of food jumped by 12% in the past year.

— One of Tunisia’s most powerful labor unions staged a nationwide public sector strike last week. The North African country faces a deteriorating economic crisis.

— Hundreds of activists this month protested the rising cost of living in Burkina Faso. The U.N. World Food Program says the price of corn and millet has shot up more than 60% since last year reaching as high as 122% in some provinces.

“As far as this cost of living that keeps increasing is concerned we realized that the authorities have betrayed the people” said Issaka Porgo president of the civil society coalition behind the protest in the west African country.

Protesters condemn the military junta which ousted the democratically elected president in January for giving themselves a pay raise while the population faces rising prices.

The International Monetary Fund says inflation will average about 6% in advanced economies and nearly 9% in emerging and developing economies this year. Global economic growth is projected to slow by 40% to 3.6% this year and next. The IMF is calling on governments to focus support packages to those most in need to avoid triggering a recession.

The slowdown comes as the COVID-19 pandemic is still gripping industries worldwide from manufacturing to tourism. Climate change and drought are hitting agricultural production in some countries prompting export bans that push up food prices even further.

Rising food prices are particularly painful in low-income countries where 42% of household incomes are spent on food said Peter Ceretti an analyst tracking food security at risk advisory firm Eurasia Group.

“We will see more protests probably broader and angrier but I do not expect destabilizing or regime-changing protests” he said as producers adjust and governments approve subsidies.

The member states are also developing reliable alternative mechanisms for international payments he was quoted as saying by global newswires.

Earlier the group said it was working on setting up a joint payment network to cut reliance on the Western financial system. The BRICS countries have been also boosting the use of local currencies in mutual trade.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recently said the BRICS countries—Brazil Russia India China and South Africa—are currently working on setting up a new global reserve currency. “The issue of creating an international reserve currency based on a basket of currencies of our countries is being worked out” he said at the BRICS Business Forum.#

However former ambassador of India to Russia DB Venkatesh Varma said that national currencies are likely to play a greater role for trade within BRICS but it is ‘impractical’ to expect them to lead up to ‘de-dollarisation’.

""BRICS is taking a very important initiative in looking at alternatives because the need for alternatives is very real. But the key issue is how quickly and with what acceptance the alternatives will be put in place in practice. Dollar has been dominant for a very long time. But particularly since February of this year there is a greater realisation that over-dependence on a single currency—dollar as the global reserve currency—is a factor of increasing risk. But this risk cannot be addressed overnight"" said Varma addressing a meeting of Indian and Russian experts of international relations.

Varma hinted that the fate of an alternative reserve currency will be subjected to the market forces that are beyond the control of powerful governments.

""Whatever mechanism the BRICS countries agree upon has to be finally accepted by the market because the key test is whether the international market or the national markets within the BRICS countries accept this mechanism. The governments and central banks have an important role to play. But each central bank will assess each of these proposals in terms of whether it helps in risk management and whether the markets themselves will finally accept them"" he said.

The Cuban slugger matched Corey Seager for the team lead with 15 homers when he drilled a 2-2 slider from reliever Kyle Finnegan (2-2) into Washington's bullpen just to the left of the hitting background in center field.

Nelson Cruz hit a tying two-run homer for the Nationals against for his former team in the sixth inning after Nathaniel Lowe had given Texas the lead with a two-run shot in the second.

García's winner came after he caught Keibert Ruiz's flyball at the base of the wall in right field to start the ninth and made a running catch on a liner from César Hernández for the second out.

Joe Barlow (3-1) the only right-hander to pitch on a bullpen day for Texas finished the ninth with a strikeout of Victor Robles.

The parade of lefties for Texas — four in a row — faltered with the third choice when Brock Burke gave up Juan Soto's leadoff double and Cruz's ninth homer of the season with one out in the sixth.

Taylor Hearn in his first appearance since being pulled from the rotation retired the final 11 batters he faced following consecutive walks with a wild pitch in the second inning after opener Brett Martin issued a pair of free passes in the first.

A 24-year-old left-hander who has struggled to stay in the rotation each of the past two seasons Hearn had allowed 17 runs in 18 2/3 in four June starts before his four hitless innings with one strikeout.

Martin made his third appearance as an opener for Texas but first since the left-hander's rookie year in 2019 after Matt Bush was scratched when he was deemed unavailable following a 10-pitch relief appearance in the Nats' 2-1 win in the series opener.

Lowe's 432-foot drive off to center was his 10th of the season and seventh in June. The number this month is now tied for the team lead after García matched him.

Washington's Josiah Gray didn't allow his second hit until Leody Taveras had the first of consecutive singles with two outs in the fifth. The right-hander struck out nine in a career-high seven innings and still hasn't lost on the road in 12 career starts over two seasons.

GONNA NEED A NEW PHONE

A fan's phone was crushed by a high pop foul ball from Washington leadoff hitter Lane Thomas in the seventh inning. The ball went just over the netting behind home plate. The fan's phone was on a table in the field-level boxes.

300 ELSEWHERE

The homer for Cruz who turns 42 next week was his 300th for teams other than Texas. Of his 457 career long balls the first 157 were with the Rangers. Cruz spent eight seasons in Texas from 2006-13 after a brief debut with Milwaukee.

That is a school record for a baseball program that was founded in 1895. No Division I player has homered more in the BBCOR bat era which started in 2011 when a new standard of bat designed to perform more like a wooden one was introduced.

So of those 32 home runs which one was Melendez's favorite?

Was it the one he hit at Houston’s Minute Maid Park against UCLA or the one he hit at Arlington’s Globe Life Field against Oklahoma? Maybe one of his NCAA Tournament bombs against Air Force and East Carolina? Perhaps it was one of his many moonshots? Or maybe the homers that broke records?

“I don't think I can name one” Melendez said after winning the 2022 Golden Spikes Award on Friday. “They all mean a lot.”

Though he was hesitant to pick a favorite his teammates weren't when asked Friday. Texas coach David Pierce also had a home run that he thought stood out among the rest.

Texas coach David Pierce: No. 31 at East Carolina on June 10

""No doubt it's the first one he hit at East Carolina. It looked like somebody teed up a golf ball and he hit it with a driver over the trees however far it was. It was by far the most impressive home run that he hit this year and maybe that I've ever seen.""

Texas pitcher Tristan Stevens: No. 7 at South Carolina on March 13

""There's so many highlights he has about a Top 10 in my head. I think one that stands out was when we played South Carolina and he hit the farthest baseball I've ever seen in my life. I think it was the one that was 490-something feet but I swear it went 500-plus because it hit the house or the building past the trees in dead center field in South Carolina against a really good pitcher. I remember everyone at that stadium couldn't even believe it it was pretty quiet. Yeah it definitely just kind of goes to show that what he has is something you can't teach. I think that's what makes him so special.""

Texas pitcher Pete Hansen: No. 23 at West Virginia on May 7

""The one he hit at West Virginia was probably the coolest because right after he hit it he pretty much gave up on it and thought it was a foul ball. So did everyone in our dugout. But the wind was howling that day; it was blowing out to right field so he hit it so far to the left that it just somehow got inside that foul pole. It was against a good West Virginia pitcher and it was the spark plug to our offense that day.

""I think that was probably my most memorable one from this year. But every time that guy steps to the plate he's got a chance to hit the ball a long way obviously. I kind of lost count on them because it just seemed like it happened so often.""

Texas third baseman Skyler Messinger: No. 32 at East Carolina on June 12

""The super regional one was pretty sweet. Gosh there's so many. The South Carolina one. The other one that he hit in East Carolina I think that was the farthest ball I've ever seen him hit. Just all of them he's been an absolute blast to watch. Your jaw just drops at some of the swings he takes.""

Texas outfielder Dylan Campbell: No. 6 at South Carolina on March 12 or No. 8 at the Citadel on March 16

""That's tough. I liked that South Carolina one where he flipped the bat. He had a couple cool ones (on that road trip). The Citadel the one that probably got 40 feet off the ground went to right-center. Definitely the Omaha one in 2021.""

Texas pitcher Jared Southard: No. 31 at East Carolina on June 10

""Probably the one at ECU. He said he looked it up on his phone after and it was in the street about 500 feet. The stadium went silent.

Special Contributor

Where there is smoke there is fire: We had heard for months that a big Goldman Sachs move was imminent for Dallas was going to be downtown and was going to bring in thousands of well-paying jobs for house-buying employees.

Now we know: On Wednesday the Dallas City Council voted to give the global financial institution more than $18 million in economic incentives to bring 5000 jobs to Dallas (2500 of which are already here) and construct an 800000-square-foot office tower part of Hunt Realty’s 11-acre North End development located between Victory Park and Uptown. The office project will be at 2323 North Field St. next to the Perot Museum.

The Dallas City Council overwhelmingly supported the incentives never balking at the price. Well except for District 14’s Paul Ridley.

“This is exactly the kind of company I think we should be investing in” said council member Cara Mendelsohn. “To me this is an investment that makes sense.” Council member Tennell Atkins said that giving Goldman Sachs support will build for the city’s future. “We are not giving away the store” Atkins said. “We are trying to sell Dallas.” Still council member Paul Ridley questioned offering the global financial firm millions in public funding.

Goldman was understandably tight-lipped regarding a potential move to Dallas as we tried to scout for clues earlier this month. The real estate community was and is ecstatic. Many have long believed that Goldman could well be the first of many New York City-based financial firms to make the move here.

“Dallas is always on the radar” said Rogers Healy owner and CEO of Rogers Healy Companies.

Healy said he has heard rumblings of the New York-based Goldman Sachs moving to Dallas “for a while.”

While noting Dallas’ downtown needs work its central location and affordability are draws for large corporations.

Although Dallas is gaining notoriety for being one the hottest real estate markets in the nation — home prices up 13.1 percent annually in April to $440000 and homes selling after 15 days — Healy said Dallas is becoming a hot spot for a key demographic: Millennials.

Rogers Healy

Healy added Millennials are moving to Dallas more than any city in the nation and “they’re moving here to call it home.”

He added while the demographic historically moves to Los Angeles New York and Chicago lower home prices and a stronger job market give Dallas “10 years or more” of runway in the housing market.

Healy however said one of the biggest issues with a potential move and Goldman Sachs’ 43000 employees is parking especially downtown. He said downtown currently doesn’t have the bandwidth to withstand that influx especially with heavy traffic already in the Uptown and Oak Lawn neighborhoods.

According to Bloomberg all Goldman Sachs says at this point is the bank continues “to grow our presence in the Dallas area but cannot comment at this time on our future expansion plans.”

But it’s no secret that Goldman and many financial giants are looking to move at least part of their operations from NYC. Other finance firms including Charles Schwab Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. have been drawn to North Texas:

The Wall Street titan has been on the hunt for a new office campus in Dallas that may become its largest presence in the US outside of Manhattan Bloomberg reported a year ago. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon has been seeking to reshape US operations to cut expenses and shift thousands of jobs to cheaper locales.

YASIN AKGUL/AFP via Getty Images

Shares of companies with big overseas sales are trailing domestic-focused firms according to Goldman Sachs.

A basket of stocks of domestic focused companies was outperforming firms with overseas tilt by nine percentage points.

But outperformance in this bear market merely means a smaller percentage loss.

Stocks across Wall Street have been hammered into a bear market this year but those of companies that derive the bulk of their sales outside of the US have trailed those of companies that are domestically oriented Goldman Sachs said this week.

The slump in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite has pushed the major indexes down by more than 20% in 2022 with the tech-rich Nasdaq sitting on a loss of 26%.

Analysis from Goldman Sachs published Friday showed the pain of stock losses has been particularly sharp for companies with a heavy amount of international sales. The investment bank said a basket of stocks it tracks with high domestic sales exposure has outperformed a basket of multinational stocks by nine percentage points this year.

That leaves the international basket down by 24% wider than the 15% decline in the domestic bunch. Goldman's international sales and domestic sales baskets each hold 50 S&P 500 stocks with the greatest share of non-US and domestic revenues.

Foreign sales in 2021 accounted for 29% of the $14 trillion of aggregate S&P 500 revenues compared with 28% in 2020.

What's helped provide upside support for US-focused companies is the climb in the trade-weighted US dollar's value Goldman said.

The US Dollar Index which measures the greenback's performance against six other currencies this year has soared to fresh 20-year highs above the 105 level. But dollar strength can hurt multinational companies in part as it makes their products more expensive for holders of other currencies to purchase.

What's also put pressure on the multinationals basket is the Information Technology sector as it rakes in 59% of its revenue from overseas. Tech stocks have plunged as the climb in interest rates can lead to chipped prospects for future profit. The materials sector is the only other one that makes most of its revenue from overseas at 50%.

The largest region of non-US exposure was Asia Pacific at 9% or $1 trillion followed by Europe at 6% or $846 billion. But only 3% or $370 billion of S&P 500 revenues were explicitly from Greater China said Goldman which conducted its analysis on recent 10-K annual corporate filings.

On a regional basis it said Monolithic Power Qualcomm and Las Vegas Sands were the companies with the largest revenue exposure to Greater China. In Greater Europe the list was topped by travel services company Bookings and gold miner Newmont.

Wade corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees — and in some cases their dependents — seeking abortions in states that outlaw the procedure.

The court's decision to roll back the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling which protected the federal constitutional right to an abortion is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America leaving abortion policy up to individual states and paving the way for numerous states to pass new abortion restrictions. As of Friday afternoon state officials in at least seven states said that new abortion bans can now be enforced.

Millions of people seeking abortions could soon be forced to travel across state lines to access the procedure adding to the cost of an already often expensive healthcare service. For many employers' benefit packages may be the only way they can afford an abortion.

In response corporations some with headquarters or offices in Republican-controlled states are taking action. Companies such as Citigroup Salesforce and Match Group first promised financial support to employees seeking abortions in affected states after a draft version of the opinion leaked in May. Many more followed suit on Friday. Some including Bumble and Lyft also previously said they would donate to organizations that support women's rights such as Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice.

Corporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent and worry about the impact these states' anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.

Here are some of the prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.

Microsoft

Microsoft extended its financial support for ""critical healthcare"" including abortions and gender-affirming care to include coverage for travel expenses for such services after the draft opinion overturning Roe was first leaked.

Apple

The company's existing benefits package allows employees to travel out of state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state according to an Apple spokesperson.

Meta

The tech giant intends to offer travel expense reimbursement ""to the extent permitted by law"" for employees seeking out-of-state health care and reproductive services according to a spokesperson. ""We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved"" the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

Yelp

Yelp's existing healthcare plan for U.S. employees pays for women family members and partners to travel out of states with strict abortion laws such as Texas and Oklahoma which ban abortions after 6 weeks.

""This ruling puts women's health in jeopardy denies them their human rights and threatens to dismantle the progress we've made toward gender equality in the workplaces since Roe"" Jeremy Stoppelman co-founder of Yelp said in a statement Friday. ""Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.""

Disney

Disney employees who are unable to access medical care in one location will be given affordable coverage to access the same care in another location according to a company spokesperson. The benefit covers family planning and pregnancy-related decisions.

Uber

Uber's U.S. insurance plans already cover reproductive health benefits including abortion and travel expenses to access healthcare. The rideshare company will also reimburse any drivers sued under state law for providing transportation to a clinic through the app according to an Uber spokesperson.

Netflix

The streaming company offers travel reimbursement coverage for U.S. full-time employees and their dependents who need to travel for healthcare treatments including abortions and gender-affirming care a Netflix spokesperson told CNN. The company provides a lifetime allowance of $10000 per employee (or their dependents) per service.

Bumble

Bumble a female-driven dating app said Friday that it will support its employees' ability to access ""the healthcare services they need"" including abortion care. A Bumble spokesperson added that the company will donate to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

""Abortion is healthcare and healthcare is a human right. We are deeply troubled by the Supreme Court decision"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Match Group

Dating app company Match Group in October established a partnership with Planned Parenthood Los Angeles to provide abortion access for its Texas employees and their dependents. The company is currently considering expanding that benefit to all its U.S. staff including remote employees in states with trigger laws that may soon ban abortions according to a Match spokesperson. Match healthcare plans also help to cover travel and lodging costs for employees who need to travel to receive care the spokesperson said.

Box.com

Box.com will cover employee travel and medical expenses incurred by employees while seeking reproductive services.

Levi Strauss

The denim company said through The Levi Strauss Foundation that it is providing grants to the Center for Reproductive Rights Afiya Center and ARC-Southeast which provides direct assistance to women and communities in need of care. The company previously said that under its benefits plan employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren't included in the company's benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement it said.

Comcast-NBC Universal

Comcast has an existing healthcare travel benefit for all employees that covers up to $4000 per trip up to three trips per year with a maximum coverage cap of $10000 per year. The amount paid out depends on the type of health care procedure but abortion care is covered according to the company.

Warner Bros Discovery

Warner Brothers Discovery which owns CNN on Friday expanded healthcare benefits options to include expenses for employees and their covered family members who need to travel to access abortions and other reproductive care according to a company spokesperson.

Condé Nast

The media company said Friday it will reimburse travel and lodging for employees who need abortion infertility or gender-reaffirming services and cannot obtain them locally. CEO Roger Lynch said in an internal memo the Supreme Court decision was a ""crushing blow to reproductive rights"" and said the most powerful way the company can respond is through its content and journalism.

JPMorgan Chase

JPMorgan on Friday said that its health care benefits have long covered abortion care. And starting in July abortion will be included in the company's health care travel benefit that covers services that can only be obtained far from home according to spokesperson Joseph Evangelisti.

Nike

The sportswear company said in a statement that it covers travel and lodging expenses in situations where healthcare services are not available close to home according to a statement Nike released Friday.

""No matter where our teammates are on their family planning journey — from contraception and abortion coverage to pregnancy and family-building support through fertility surrogacy and adoption benefits — we are here to support their decisions"" the statement reads.

Starbucks

The coffee company is providing employees enrolled in its healthcare plan a medical travel benefit to access an abortion according to a public letter to employees by Sara Kelly Starbucks acting executive vice president of partner resources.

""We all need to process this in our own way and as you do here is what I want you to know: no matter where you live or what you believe we will always ensure you have access to quality healthcare"" Kelly said in the letter.

Dick's Sporting Goods

For employees who live in a state that restricts abortion access Dick's will provide up to $4000 in travel expense reimbursement to travel to the nearest location where care is legally available the company said in a statement Friday.

Kroger

The grocer's healthcare package includes travel benefits of up to $4000 to facilitate access for reproductive healthcare services including abortion and fertility treatments according to a Kroger spokesperson.

Alaska Airlines

By Sophie Christensen

West Hartford Pride kicked off the last weekend of Pride Month with a large crowd attending a celebration on Saturday that featured performances from drag queens and local musicians.

Sister Funk an all-female band based in New Haven gave a wonderful performance. Carrie Ashton another Connecticut-based musician followed Sister Funk with lively acoustic music. The festival also featured award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter Shawnee Kish.

In addition the Hartford Gay Men’s Chorus as well as the Connecticut Gay Men’s Chorus performed selections from their repertoire.

Many local companies had booths set up at the festival showing their support for Pride with many giving out rainbow-colored trinkets. There was also a waffle truck and a piña colada booth.

Amidst the turbulence facing our country today one festival attendee claimed they felt “conflicted.”

“I feel really great to be here” they said “but at the same time there are a lot of things going on in the world that aren’t so great.”

Others rejoiced excited to be attending their first Pride event and overwhelmed by the positive energy and never-ending support from fellow attendees.

“It’s just constant compliments. You walk up to someone and say that you love their makeup and they compliment you back. Then you walk two feet and someone else compliments you … the energy here is amazing” said Tae a first-time Pride attendee.

The Festival ran from noon to 6 p.m. and ended with an hour-long dance party.

For two consecutive shows at Hartford Stage Christopher Arnott must have been wearing blinders when he reviewed its shows. Apparently he did not notice the audience laughing and the enthusiastic applause at “Lost in Yonkers” and at “Kiss My Aztec!” If he had he should have mentioned it. There is no question that there were things to criticize in both shows but not almost everything. His reviews in the Courant undoubtedly have cost Hartford Stage ticket sales.

Does Mr. Arnott have a vendetta against Hartford Stage? Is he single-handedly trying to send it into oblivion? Lately he certainly is not seeing what most of the audience is seeing and enjoying at this outstanding theatre company.

We need guns to protect us from government

In 1929 the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to 1953 dissidents unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated. In 1911 Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917 thousands of Armenians were rounded up and exterminated. Germany established gun control in 1938. From 1939 to 1945 millions of Jews and others were rounded up and exterminated. You don’t see politicians disseminating this information.

Our Founding Fathers enacted the Second Amendment to protect citizens from corrupt government. Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property. Gun control laws adversely affect only law-abiding citizens. With guns we are citizens; without them we are subjects. During WWII the Japanese decided not to invade America because they knew most Americans were armed. If we Americans did not possess guns we may be all speaking Japanese. A letter to The Courant put blame for recent shooting deaths on guns and stated that gun manufacturers should be held responsible as well as the NRA. I assume the writer would then want the car manufacturers held responsible for all automobile deaths. If we had an effective deterrent such as automatic death within 10 days of being found guilty and being fed only bread and water while living in a cage that might make people rethink their evil plans.

We were energy independent under Trump

Debbie Barrett in a June 18 letter to the editor wrote that gas rose from 30 to 50 cents per gallon during the Nixon presidency.

That is a leftist fabrication. The first year of the Jimmy Carter regime gas went from 35 to 70 cents per gallon doubling its price. Three years later it would double again to $1.40 per gallon. She complains that we’ve had 50 years to make ourselves energy independent. We were energy independent just a couple of years ago during Donald Trump’s presidency. We not only supplied enough oil to satisfy our needs but were exporting 20% of what we drilled to help hold down the price of gas on a global basis.

You might not like Trump but everything he did was for the betterment of the country including minorities and those on fixed income. She complains that we had 50 years to fix the energy problem. Ask yourself who was a member of the House the Senate the vice presidency and the presidency 90% of those 50 years? Joe Biden. And you expect him to fix what he broke on his first day as president? If so I have this great bridge in Brooklyn that I’d like to sell you.

Hasbro Designer Explains why Velocitron Scourge has a Nemesis Prime deco

The character this was supposed to be was not specified when he got the task. The only specification regarding the deco was that the trailer should be silver. As you can read below the designer was guided by the material of the mold. So with Laser Prime (who is the main use of this mold) both the alt mode windows and robot mode chest windows are made of clear plastic which is a departure from the original toy. Since the clear plastic for ""Scourge"" is pink that means the entire robot mode torso would also be pink clear plastic. This mold was designed so that the torso clear plastic would match the alt mode clear plastic. So when it came time to decide the colour of the torso black was chosen for the torso to match the alt mode accordingly.



So there you go it seems to all come back from a lack of unified direction for the deco and character at the beginning as well as limitations from the way the Legacy Laser Prime mold is constructed.



The designer does conclude that despite all that (limitations and lack of clarity) he went with the best looking deco he could think of. On that point it is hard to fault him. While the deco doesn't look like Scourge it is still striking and well done as many fans have already said on message boards and social media across the web.



Let us knw what you think of both the reasoning and the toy.







A big question from fans recently has been why the new Scourge toy has a Nemesis Prime deco (i.e. black body with red windows) rather than an RID Scourge deco (i.e. grey body with black and white windows). Well the designer assigned to the deco Sam answered fans on Instagram. The answers are below but we will run through what went on.The character this was supposed to be was not specified when he got the task.

While a straight redeco of Car Robots 2000 Black Convoy would have been preferable to me I don't hate what we got. Getting an explanation makes it much easier to accept (in my case not speaking for others).



I'm kind of using a different more head-canon-esque explanation for the character in my collection anyway. Posted by sol magnus on June 25th 2022 @ 1:24pm CDT

That might not be a joke. The original rumors said that Override was a retool of Hot Rod and there was precedent in the 3P scene where I think MMC used a shared design for those two. If it's an IDW Hot Rod as with Legacy IDW Blurr that would arguably be a better base.

It would be easier IMO to retool 86 Rod into IDW Rod than Override. With the 86 mold the chest and shins could be swapped out very easily and the tall shoulders could also be done if they don't mind sacrificing articulation. I'm not even sure how IDW Rod's shoulders could even work with Override's transformation scheme and the chest would be more complicated to retool. Not that Override couldn't work it would just take more extensive retooling.



Not to mention IIRC it was clarified that the wave 2 voyager assortment was going to be 2 Hot Rods and 1 Override so it would be a bit odd having the whole wave be the same mold. It's cool that this subline is going to continue but so far the only one from wave two I might be interested in is Hot Rod and only if it's a MTMTE version. Blurr and Tarn give me hope.It would be easier IMO to retool 86 Rod into IDW Rod than Override.

honestly the different deco is kinda making me want to get this one now. I have the original black battle convoy and I don't see the legacy mold as an upgrade but rather something of a downgrade. But I have always loved the nemesis prime color theme more then the scourge one. decisions decisions... Posted by Immortal Starscream on June 25th 2022 @ 2:17pm CDT

-Crasher from Drag Strip if they're actually going for accuracy to the original design (assuming they can cuz rights weirdness)? The new head would fill in the seat area of the alt mode she'd just have some extra wheels (and would get to be a secret extra Stunticon cuz why not)

These listings come from Walmart which is the exclusive outlet for these toys.Velocitron listingsTra Gen legacy Velocitron deluxe CrasherProduct number: F8050EAN: 5010994186609Tra Gen Legacy Velocitron Deluxe Shadow StrikerProduct Number: F8049EAN: 5010994186586Tra Gen Legacy Velocitron Voyager Hot RodProduct Number: F8054EAN: 5010994186593Tra Gen Legacy Velocitron LDR 2Product Number: F8052EAN: 5010994186616The Leader is not known and it is unknown if this is the extent of the listings it probably is not.



Interesting list.



Crasher might be a buy if they ive her a good alt mode.  But Shadow Striker is more interesting. Might mean we get a R.I.D SideBurn repaint out of that which is one step closer to updating the R.I.D Car Robots.

I could be wrong but I think Hasbro will fix one of the mistakes they made during Combiner Wars and not make ""limbs"" that don't have dedicated combiners. A G2 repaint sure even an entire retool for a new team but I think they'll stay away from just doing repaints for the sake of repaints. I hope so anyway.



Emerje I still don't understand how they could be confused by what colors the G2 long nose tanker truck with big shoulders should have when painted black. He's been done half a dozen times before every previous design team on both sides of the Pacific understood his colors how did the current design team have no idea what they were supposed to do with him? It's just frustrating they had no clear plan for this figure and it ended up being a mess of ideas mashed together. It also means they aren't going to do it ""right"" later like many of us hoped. Or at least not for a few years since they clearly have nothing planned.I could be wrong but I think Hasbro will fix one of the mistakes they made during Combiner Wars and not make ""limbs"" that don't have dedicated combiners.

I couldn't give a toss what the designer stated; until it comes out in the ""correct"" Scourge colours I'm not buying it.



Either this figure will get the correct colours soon or a better version still come out later. Until then I'll stick with the Takara Tomy Legends version for the time being. Posted by primalxconvoy on June 25th 2022 @ 9:50pm CDT

There is precedent in how both of his Takara Legends toys have been depicted as new upgraded bodies for him instead just reinterpretations of his original body:













His Deluxe toy even has red/pink chest windows like this new one does. Granted in that Deluxe toy's case it was because those chest windows were also his actual truck windows but it's still a case of his robot mode having red/pink windows.



But while that gives precedent for the color of his chest windows it admittedly doesn't do the same for his torso being black instead of gray. Well there just so happens to be another toy of his that in fact does. Scourge's very first upgraded-body toy had a black torso instead of a gray one. And that was Destructicon Scourge:







Sure that one also had the gray-and-black chest windows and shoulders but I do feel that it could be the missing link between the original Scourge and this new one.



In fact one could even call the Velocitron Scourge the missing link between all of the others Scourges. If one wanted to consider the Destructicon the actual second body upgrade then the Velocitron one could come next followed by the existing evolution of Scourge's bodies giving us the following pattern:



Body 1: Gray torso gray-and-black windows







Then he undergoes a significant body-change in which his torso changes from gray to black (and his overall shape changes) but his robot mode windows stay the same.



Body 2: Black torso gray-and-black windows







Then he goes back to his original shape but keeps his black torso and his robot windows change to red/pink.



Body 3: Black torso red/pink windows







Then he changes again his torso goes back to gray but his windows stay red/pink.



Body 4: Gray torso red/pink windows







The TFSS version is similar enough to just be considered the ""Hasbro version"" of this form.







And finally he upgrades one more time keeping his gray torso but returing his windows to gray-and-black restoring his original deco to come full circle.



Body 5: Gray torso gray-and-black windows



I've been mulling it over about the new deco for this version of Scourge and feel that despite my (and many others') initial misgivings about it I'm slowly warming up to it on the notion of it not being a new version of Scourge in his original body but a new version of Scourge in an upgraded body.There is precedent in how both of his Takara Legends toys have been depicted as new upgraded bodies for him instead just reinterpretations of his original body:His Deluxe toy even has red/pink chest windows like this new one does.

I'm not really a fan of G2 Laser Prime for me personally he will always be G1 look. That said I do like the redeco as is for Scourge and might be tempted to buy it as a totally different bot though I would prefer a different head sculpt to set it apart. That is where I think Hasbro fails at times on repaints by not tooling a new head to make it look like a different character this one could have looked much better with a source accurate artistic head sculpt rather than just reusing Prime's boxy/squarish looking one.

Why's everyone so confused as to which Shadow Striker it's going to be? It's so very clearly going to be RotF Shadow Striker. It's just so obvious. It's going to be a black with red redeco of the as of yet unseen SS86 core class Wheelie with a bunch of extra weapons to make up the deluxe price point. It's going to have all three pieces of the sword as well as the guns for Skywarp. That's on top of anything Wheelie is going to come with. In fact it will come with two complete swords and Thundercracker's guns.



I mean the only thing more obvious than this is the Legacy Hot Shot being an update of RID 2001 Hot Shot using a version of Sideswipe as a base.



I'm obviously kidding in case it wasn't clear but I wouldn't put it past Hasbro to mess with fans at this point. I just still think this leak is too good to be true. I already know it's from the Walmart computer system to whoever tried to tell me in the other thread but it wouldn't be the first time those were faked or just outright wrong if I recall correctly.



But no lie I would love both of those figures though. Dipping into the Spy Changers would be dangerous though. Some of those molds seem to have as many deco options as Starscream does.



For Crasher I think Dragstrip could be easily retooled into her. The spoiler/feet could be retooled to better resemble Crasher's. The top of the vehicle/chest could be too. The front wheels could be redone as well to have only two and still have the same transformation somehow. This way when you transform them everything will still work correctly. But most importantly with some reworking the front scoop can be placed behind her head and/or back. A hinge system of some sort or just retooled ball pegs or ports to get them down and then a slider to connect the two halves as well as get them out of the way of the retooled shoulder wheels. Pop them off and do it yourself to see what it would look like. Even if they don't retool this area the ball pegs fit into the hollow parts under the scoop and a 3D printed part can be inserted to friction around the ball pegs holding the scoop down and back behind the head. And who cares if it's a combiner part? It's not like you can tell from looking at it. You have to go out of your way to stab a release mechanism with a flat object to get it to separate on its own. It would just be an added feature.



And I joked about about Hot Rod being a retool of Override on another site last night. I don't know if I'm the one that the other commenter was talking about or not but if they were at least they figured out that I was mostly joking in that large post I made. Again the whole leak just seems crazy. And I was tired at the time like I am now so I was having a little more fun with the post than normal.



I want all the Leo Primes now. Regular sparkly white black purple Lio Junior Thundertron Go Prime Alpha Trizer Leobreaker Nemesisbreaker Razorclaw Universe Leo Prime Kimba Mufasa Simba Scar Solgaleo shiny Solgaleo Pyroar and shiny Pyroar colors lol. Taste the rainbow of lions. I want a whole bunch of lions so I can form Voltron. Wait all the Voltron lions are female so that wouldn't work. I mean none of them have manes so they must be female right? Maybe they're too young to grow out their majestic manes yet. Posted by Grahf_ on June 26th 2022 @ 12:40am CDT

Between the lines I read that quote as the actual colour scheme was looked into retroactively. When the mistake was noticed a wishy-washy ""new version"" answer was given instead.



If it had been Hot Rod or Optimus with inverted colours someone would have rectified it immediately. But it is neither a G1 character nor one of the most popular. So zero F's were given to the error. Posted by AllNewSuperRobot on June 26th 2022 @ 5:14am CDT

So quick opinion on the official releases:



- Diaclone colors (Burn Out & Clampdown): meh okay I guess. Honestly I'd be more interested in an actual crossover with the Diaclone reboot than more Easter Egg repaints but I'm not against it.

- Road Hauler: the screaming face is an odd choice but seems good.

- Blurr: my only question is why they don't specify the universe for this one. Otherwise I really like this remold.

- Cosmos: a bit of an oddball choice and I'm not too sure about the protuding cockpit. However all of that just makes it seem oddly endearing to me.

- Road Rocket: I'd probably remold or replace the Energon blade/shield with a buzzsaw but otherwise a perfect retool. Nothing else to say.

- Override: yes! Double yes! Triple yes!

- Scourge:... ok at first I was weirded out by the innacurate deco and knowing that it was mostly due to not knowing which version of ""anti-Optimus"" to do just soured the whole thing more for me. But Sabrblade's little upgrade timeline theory made me warm up to the deco. I'll still wait to see if a better one comes along though.



As for the leaked releases:



- I do hope Crasher is closer to the GoBots design. Takara and Bandai have teamed up now so it's possible.

- I'm divided about Shadow Striker. On the one hand if it's based on the Universe design we might get a Side Burn retool that isn't such a massive shellformer. On the other if it's the Cyberverse design we might finally get the Frankensteined mold. I really don't know which one I want most.

- ... IDW Hot Rod? Energon Rodimus? Animated Rodimus? I really don't know.

- I'm hoping the Leader is Cybertron Crumplezone but it probably will be someone else. Posted by MaximalNui on June 26th 2022 @ 9:05am CDT

IMO there's no way it's going to be Universe I know RiD fans are still desperate for more but this isn't how it'll happen. I don't think the Frankenstein approach is likely either because the toy will still need to convert and none of the Cyberverse toys had that. Plus the most recent comics didn't keep that design element. Practically speaking the best we could hope for would be recolored limbs and I don't think that's very fun.

On Crasher and Shadow Striker... ho boy. I can't really say anything about it that hasn't said except this: if they're the same general shape of car there is a chance Crasher may actually be white to offset Shadow Striker:







... which happens to be the basis for SG Crasher



If she's a racing car like Movie 2007 Fracture... Earthrise Mirage will do just fine. On Scourge it seems like he got a little bit of artistic freedom which is fine considering the plethora of ""Black Optimus Prime"" deco variants we have. The non-specific instruction didn't help and it feels like the higher-ups are like ""whatever looks good"" which is more like ""I can't be bothered to care"" attitude to me (which I somewhat hate).On Crasher and Shadow Striker... ho boy.

Lets get into it! For capsule programs and the mainline as a whole we have certain allocated funds for new molds. I wanted a Cosmos badly to further finish the deluxe minibots collection but just because I love this guy. His voice design aesthetic colors and especially his alt mode are all fire.



Swipe right and you will see how I sold him in as a partial tool using the Origins BB mold. He would of been more of a new rendition of him. I just didnt think a g1 version of him was possible with the tooling allocated. But TT made it happen All NEW in 3 molds!!!



Ittoku Kuwazu worked closely with Hasui Shogo in making this guy the best Cosmos evah! I chimed in on making the flag alt as a blaster and really worked hard on getting the proportions as close to his animation appearance as possible. As you can see from block model to final look a lot had to happen. But with our great partnership this guy is ready to officiate the Speedia 500.



Let me know who you are routing for to become the new leader of Velocitron!!!



























Transformers head designer Mark Maher offered some pretty cool info on his Instagram page regarding his design of the upcoming Walmart exclusive Cosmos toy. He actually started the design process with the Cybertronian mode Bumblebee toy as a basis. You can see the images of that dropped process below along with his commentary. What is really cool here is how we see the importance of Takara in the process. They don't just figure out how to work with the Hasbro design given to them (which in this case was a retool) but they seem to have the power to change the design fully which in this case meant create a new mold. He also posted an image of the entire set all together so you can see the range of sizes. And Hasbro designer Sam Smith also added some turnaround videos on his Instagram page. You canto see them.

For me the saucer is ""good enough"" and the bot mode is nearly perfect. I don't think I would have been very happy with a skinny lanky Cosmos just so he'd have an objectively better alt mode. The top of the saucer being off center on the proposed figure would have always bugged me.

Joe Mash-Up Megatron H.I.S.S. Tank & Baroness,"Worlds collide once again but this time it’s between Transformers and the G.I. Joe franchise with the Transformers Collaborative: G.I. Joe Mash-Up Megatron H.I.S.S. Tank and Baroness. Previous Transformers collaboratives have been with Top Gun Jurassic Park X-Men and Back to the Future.

The Cobra H.I.S.S. tank transforms from robot to tank mode in 28 steps and it comes with a G.I. Joe Retro Baroness figure packed in a retro card back. The figure includes a Cobra backpack rifle and display stand while Megatron comes with his fusion cannon (of course).

Talk about going retro the toy is even accurately scaled to the original 1983 Cobra H.I.S.S. Tank toy and the box is inspired by the classic ’80s Transformers and G.I. Joe packaging.

The Baroness figure can be seated in the cockpit in the turret position (both in robot and tank mode) and even stand on the back platform of the tank. Unfortunately Megatron does run a little on the chunky side on his back and his arms are a little short which restricts his articulation quite a bit.

Other than that at least the detailing of the printed decals and Cobra insignia are a nice touch and Megatron’s face sculpt is very reminiscent of the G1 design which adds to the nostalgic look of the toy.

The Transformers Collaborative: G.I. Joe Mash-Up Megatron H.I.S.S. Tank and Baroness is available for order via The Falcon’s Hangar priced at S$159.90 and starts shipping on 1 July 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMvZ2ktam9lLWNsYXNzaWZpZWQtc3Rvcm0tc2hhZG93LWFtYXppbmctZmlndXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GI Joe Week: Classic Storm Shadow Joins The Classified Team,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMvZ2ktam9lLWNsYXNzaWZpZWQtc3Rvcm0tc2hhZG93LWFtYXppbmctZmlndXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000029D47D31510>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMvZ2ktam9lLWNsYXNzaWZpZWQtc3Rvcm0tc2hhZG93LWFtYXppbmctZmlndXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzI2L3N0YXItd2Fycy10aGUtYmxhY2stc2VyaWVzLWJhZC1iYXRjaC1lY2hvLWZpZ3VyZS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Star Wars The Black Series Bad Batch Echo figure review — Lyles Movie Files,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://lylesmoviefiles.com/2022/06/26/star-wars-the-black-series-bad-batch-echo-figure-review/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzI2L3N0YXItd2Fycy10aGUtYmxhY2stc2VyaWVzLWJhZC1iYXRjaC1lY2hvLWZpZ3VyZS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

That’s despite Guithele Ruiz-Nicholas collecting just over $12500 the most money she’s added in a month since filing for the contest in March. Her May haul however came mostly on the back of a $9000 self-loan to the campaign which can be refunded if not spent.

Rogers attracted money from a wide array of sectors. Her donor list included $1000 contributions from lawyer Alexander Heckler and a PAC connected to HCA Healthcare.

Lauderdale Lakes Commissioner Veronica Edwards Phillips also donated $200 to help her fellow municipal official pursue the Broward Commission seat.

Rogers also served in the House for eight years representing House District 95. She was first elected as Lauderdale Lakes Mayor in 2016 then re-elected in 2020.

Both Rogers and Ruiz-Nicholas are seeking to succeed Commissioner Torey Alston. Alston took the position after being appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis. The seat became open when former Commissioner Dale Holness resigned to run in a Special Election for a congressional seat.

Ruiz-Nicolas lives in Plantation and runs a marketing company.

Rogers the better fundraiser of the two ramped up her spending in May. She spent more than $15000 during the month compared to less than $5500 spent during her previous four months as a candidate combined.

The biggest chunk of that spending nearly $6400 went toward qualifying fees for the race. Rogers also spent more than $5200 with City Tees Inc. on campaign signs and another $3000 with Purple Bird Communications on bank fees. Rogers also sent $310 to Speedy Print Inc. for flyers.

Ruiz-Nicolas meanwhile spent just under $1400 in May. She cut a $1000 check to WHEN LLC for promotion services. Ruiz-Nicolas also spent $366 on printing costs with Printopia.

With just two months to go until the Aug. 23 Primary Election Rogers retains nearly $99000 while Ruiz-Nicolas holds less than $31000.

(theahl.com) … The Calder Cup has been awarded again and the Chicago Wolves are back on top of the American Hockey League.

The Wolves secured their first Calder Cup championship since 2008 and their third overall tonight with a 4-0 victory over the Springfield Thunderbirds at MassMutual Center winning the Calder Cup Finals four games to one.

Wolves forward Josh Leivo won the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the most valuable player of the 2022 Calder Cup Playoffs after finishing with 15 goals and 14 assists for 29 points in 18 games the highest point total by any player in the Calder Cup Playoffs in the last 14 years.

Alex Lyon made 28 saves in Game 5 for his second shutout of the postseason. After losing Game 1 of the Finals the Wolves won four in a row outscoring the Thunderbirds by a combined score of 18-4. They became the third team to win a Calder Cup as the top affiliate of the Carolina Hurricanes organization following the Charlotte Checkers in 2019 and the Springfield Indians in 1991.

When AHL President and CEO Scott Howson presented the Calder Cup to Wolves captain Andrew Poturalski it marked the first time in three years that the trophy had been awarded after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellations of the 2020 and 2021 playoffs.

Chicago went 14-4 during the postseason after a league-best 50-win 110-point regular season. Under head coach Ryan Warsofsky at 34 the youngest coach to win the Calder Cup since Peter Laviolette in 1999 the Wolves defeated the Rockford IceHogs (3-0) the Milwaukee Admirals (3-1) and the Stockton Heat (4-2) before eliminating Springfield in five games in the Finals.

Chicago’s victory brings an end to the AHL’s 86th season. In operation since 1936 the AHL continues to serve as the top development league for all 32 National Hockey League teams. Nearly 90 percent of today’s NHL players are American Hockey League graduates and more than 100 honored members of the Hockey Hall of Fame spent time in the AHL in their careers.

The 2021-22 Vikings had some great moments in a 21-6 season but it didn’t end in nearly as exciting fashion. ACCHS lost in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference semifinals to Parkland fell to Bethlehem Catholic in the District 11 semis and had its season end with a 59-58 loss to West Philadelphia in the first round of the state tournament.

So the Vikings entered the summer looking to get their swagger back not to mention rebuild a roster with new faces after the graduation of all-staters Liam Joyce and Tyson Thomas as well as three other seniors.

So far so good as ACCHS is having a solid varsity summer league season and improved to 3-0 in the Cedar Beach Basketball Showcase with a pair of wins on Saturday.

Central is one of four teams still unbeaten in the Varsity Big School Division and will play Muhlenberg Township at 10 a.m. Sunday. The other 10 a.m. winners bracket semifinal features Central York and Freedom also at 10.

The tournament continues through the day with the Small School Division finals at 3 p.m. and Big School and JV tournament championships around 7 p.m.

The Vikings beat Reading which was represented by its JV players 56-20 and then outlasted Liberty 44-36.

“We had been struggling” said Central assistant Kevin Keeler who ran the team on Saturday. “We lost by Reading by 40 in a tournament last week and coach [Dennis Csensits] called a lot of timeouts and got some technicals but we’re trying to take care of the little things and I think we’ve been getting better each game and today against Liberty was the best we’ve played all year.”

Central featured great scoring balance with David Fridia Jahrel Vigo and Nico Pulieri all scoring 13 points.

“It was nice to see that scoring balance we had in this one” Keeler said. “Nico is a senior and we’re looking for him to step up. Jahrel was [The Morning Call’s] rookie of the year last year as a top freshman and he’s getting better and we’re looking for him to play point guard this year and David has unlimited potential. He had a slam dunk today and got us going and can block shots. We have potential. It’s just a matter of being fundamentally sound and playing good defense. That’s what we did against Liberty.”

Keeler said that when you have players like Joyce and Thomas leading the way for four years “you sort of become dependent on those guys.”

“Those guys were 1000-point scorers headed to college and the guys we have now have to figure out their leadership roles and it’s frustrating at times but there’s talent here and we coach the heck out of them and coach them hard and they are getting better.”

Keeler said he has been coaching in tournaments at Cedar Beach for about 40 years the first 35 at Quakertown the last five with Central Catholic.

“I like being outside” Keeler said. “I enjoy a different atmosphere. It’s a whole different world. People love it and the kids like it. We played in Philly Live! last week and I know a lot of teams have their guys down there this weekend. It’s just the way summer is.”

At Philly Live! college coaches from all levels are there and Keeler said it’s also nice to see teams from Philly New York Delaware and other places.

But many of the kids still like playing at Cedar Beach.

“We’re finally outside and it’s fun” Fridia said.

As for the key to the team’s success Fridia didn’t hesitate.

“We have to play as a team and we have to play good defense” Fridia said. “Whether it’s man-to-man defense a 2-3 zone defending the 3 and defending the drive we’ve got to work together.”

Patriot Pride

Freedom coming off a 10-13 season has been raising eyebrows all summer and raising the level of its play as well.

The Patriots posted wins over Berks Catholic and Central Dauphin and have a shot at having a short and successful Sunday.

“We’re playing really good basketball with just two losses in the league and we’re trying to build a winning culture and carry it into a season” said assistant coach Marc Corsi who ran the team on Saturday. “Nick Ellis [an all-league player who averaged 21.5 points per game last season] is really stepping up and starting to trust his teammates more. We’re playing more like a team and guys are contributing.”

Freedom is just two years removed from a District 11 championship had considerable success the preceding summer.

This year’s team would love to get things started with a big run on Sunday.

“It’s always excited to go into Sunday unbeaten and we could be here for awhile” Corsi said. “We’re keeping our eye on the prize.”

Nico Pulieri David Fridia and Jahrel Vigo all scored 13 points to help Allentown Central Catholic beat Liberty 44-36 Saturday in the Cedar Beach Basketball Showcase.

Paris Hilton waved Cannes Lion International Festival of Creativity goodbye on Instagram.

More from Footwear News

Hilton expressed how much fun she had at the French festival which ended yes Friday in a short but sweet Instagram post. The star djed at the festival and spoke on a panel to fans and colleagues.

The post on her Instagram reads “Had such an incredible time at @Cannes_Lions with brilliant minds & innovators! ✨ So excited for all the projects upcoming! ⚡️Loved my chic @LanvinOfficial outfit that made me feel like an empowered #BossBabe. 👑.”

For her brief goodbye Hilton wore a turquoise blue short sleeve top tucked into a dark blue pencil skirt. The top was a mock neck style and contrasted the dark blue paired with it. Hilton donned a wide-brimmed black sun hat and fastened a blue scarf belt to her waist. The star wore silver jewelry black sunglasses and a black and gold crossbody handbag to finish the look. Hilton popped on a pair of wedged espadrils and secured them to her feet with black ribbon tied neatly in a bow. The ensemble turns business wear on its head and makes a case for sun hats as meeting attire.

Hilton gave major princess vibes during her panel. As per usual the multi-hyphenate mogul made a glamorous entrance at the event stepping out in a gorgeous dusty blue midi dress. The garment had a plunging low-cut neckline with a spotted print all over a frilled design on the short sleeves and an ankle-length mesh overlay skirt. In true fashion form Hilton added luxe elements to her ensemble with a diamond choker necklace bracelets and rings. She held her signature blond tresses back with a bedazzled headband which resembled a crown.

And 11% of vacation home renters said they had discovered a hidden camera during a stay according to a survey by the real estate investment company IPX1031. Spy cameras are not a new problem. In South Korea more than 30000 cases of filming with hidden cameras were reported to the police between 2013 and 2018 according to the New York-based non-profit organization Human Rights Watch. The number of hidden spy camera reports has proliferated because of the increasing accessibility and inexpensiveness of such cameras combined with the public's growing ability to detect them said Kenneth Bombace CEO of intelligence firm Global Threat Solutions. Experts share simple methods to locate hidden spy cameras in hotel rooms and rental properties.

1. Conduct a physical search

When looking for hidden cameras start with areas like bathrooms and bedrooms Bombace said. Airbnb hosts are allowed to have cameras in their houses but they must inform guests and the cameras must not be placed in private spaces he said.

Almost all covert cameras are concealed in household devices such as lights thermostats and plugged clock radios Bombace said. ""Look and see if anything looks like it's out of the ordinary and then inspect it closer"" he said. Most spy cameras are connected to an electrical source or an electronic device Bombace added. He said the first thing he does in a bedroom is unplug the clock radios and put them in a drawer. Michael O'Rourke CEO of security consulting firm Advanced Operational Concepts also said he does exactly that. Even well-hidden cameras will have a small amount of reflective glass from the lens Bombace said. ""If you use flashlights and shine them on something you think could possibly hide the camera you will see a reflection in there which is a pretty good way of detecting if there's a camera"" he said.

Even when a camera is hidden in another device like a thermostat or an outlet there will be some glass in there that is reflective because there will be a lens Bombace said.

But O'Rourke said care is needed to accurately locate hidden lenses. ""A lot of people will try to do amateur lens detection which can work"" O'Rourke said. ""However if you don't have a good search methodology — if you go too fast if you're impatient — you can miss quite a bit.""

2. Look at the Wi-Fi network

A hidden camera must be connected to a local Wi-Fi network in order to be viewed remotely Bombace said.

Wi-Fi scanning apps like Fing can identify devices on the network that are cameras he said. Those who hide cameras might use a separate Wi-Fi network to stream live video footage but Wi-Fi scanning apps can also detect how many networks are in a residence Bombace said. But Kody Kinzie a security researcher at data security and analytics firm Varonis warned that a network scanner may not catch everything. ""The next thing you can do is look for devices that are broadcasting their own network name"" he said. He recommended using apps like WiGLE to find devices that are ""broadcasting some sort of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi network name"" Kinzie added.

3. Buy a spy camera detector

If all else fails spy camera detectors can scan for radio frequencies connected to hidden cameras. These can be easily bought online from websites like Amazon or AliExpress. But O'Rourke noted this method works only if the hidden camera is transmitting data. ""So many of them now have SD cards that just store data to be retrieved after someone leaves"" O'Rourke said. ""And so these are much more difficult to detect."" Bombace added that while it is possible to buy a radio frequency scanner the cheaper ones are probably not that good. ""Like anything else you get what you pay for — if it's $30 it's probably not that good"" Bombace said. ""Better ones are going to cost hundreds or even over $1000.""

What to do if you find a camera

After locating a camera immediately disconnect it without damaging it because the camera's firmware may contain identifying information such as login credentials and the Wi-Fi network it was connected to Kinzie said.

As the fire raged Edison's 24-year-old son Charles searched frantically for his father. He finally found him calmly watching the fire his face glowing in the reflection his white hair blowing in the wind.

Charles' heart ached for his father. Edison was 67 at the time and everything was gone. When he saw his son he shouted ""Charles where's your mother?"" Then he said ""Find her. Bring her here. She will never see anything like this as long as she lives.""

The next morning Edison looked at the ruins and said ""There is great value in disaster. All our mistakes are burned up. Thank God we can start anew.""

Leaders always look for the positive even in the direst of circumstances. This story about Edison which came from Bits & Pieces magazine is a prime example.

As daunting as it may seem you can start anew. There doesn't have to be a fire and it doesn't have to be the beginning of a new year. Think about what you really want. Some things are hard to let go of to leave behind. But letting go need not be the end of the world. Think of it instead as an opportunity you can't pass up.

Author Marsha Petrie Sue said: ""Every day is a new beginning. Treat it that way. Stay away from what might have been and look at what can be.""

The world is full of people who changed their lives or jumped to a new career and started anew.

Reid Hoffman began his professional life in academia but soon caught the entrepreneurship bug. After working for Apple in the '90s and attempting to set up social networking for the company he formed another social networking platform called SocialNet in 1997. After that company went bankrupt he applied all his knowledge to what became the world's premier platform for career networking: LinkedIn.

Brad Pitt at one time chauffeured strippers to and from bachelor parties. He also worked as a furniture mover and dressed up as a giant chicken mascot for the restaurant chain El Pollo Loco. He enrolled in acting classes with the dream of a movie career. Within seven months he signed with an agent and today is one of the most famous and recognizable superstars in the world.

Pope Francis went from being a bouncer at a Buenos Aires nightclub and working as a janitor during the day to becoming pontiff (granted with a few stops in between). But he proved that big leaps even unusual or almost impossible ones are worth taking.

The husband-and-wife team of Tim and Nina Zagat behind the popular dining surveys were corporate lawyers when they first started printing their Zagot restaurant guides. The guides became so popular that the couple left their already prestigious jobs.

Bernie Marcus was fired in 1978 as chair of Handy Dan Home Improvement Centers. I learned in interviewing Marcus for my book ""We Got Fired ... and It's the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Us"" that the following year he and Arthur Blank decided to open a huge home-improvement store called the Home Depot. Today of course Home Depot is the largest home-improvement retailer with more than 2300 stores.

Contributor Kevin Corrigan offers his sage advice on why you should—or definitely should not—do what the following three emailers have seen in the field. Note: do not try these at home (or anywhere else).

Climbing with a Rope from Home Depot

During my senior year of high school my friends and I were bored. We decided we collectively knew enough about climbing for it to be safe so we went to the local outfitter and bought harnesses carabiners and belay devices but we scoffed at the price of a rope. It was way outside our budget. Instead we went to Home Depot and bought 100 feet of poly cord that was rated for 200 pounds. We climbed on that rope all day just easy 5.3 climbing on top rope. It wasn’t until I was lowering at the end of the day that I realized what a mistake I’d made. The 100-foot rope had stretched to about 200 feet shrinking to the size of eight-millimeter cord. I bought a real climbing rope the following week. I wanted to share because we are all new at some point and even with the best intentions mistakes are made. We should collectively work together to improve safety across the sport. I wish someone would have stopped us from climbing on that poly rope. —Kyle Harris

Lesson: Modern climbing ropes include a number of climber-friendly features: They can hold thousands of pounds of force. They have durable sheaths that prevent abrasion and cutting. They have the ideal amount of stretch to catch a fall softly and then bounce back to their original length and diameter. They’re supple and easy to tie and untie. They’re tested to meet rigorous safety standards. And they work great with modern belay devices. A random hardware-store rope is not designed with any of these goals in mind and can’t be expected to meet them. Always use proper climbing gear designed and rated for climbing.

Using a Toy Carabiner

I watched a guy try his first sport lead outside. He bailed after the fourth bolt. None of his friends wanted to try the route so an older climber instructed him to thread the rope directly through the bolt hanger so he wouldn’t have to leave a bail carabiner. Then the older gentleman proudly recounted a story of how he was two pitches up on a route and couldn’t finish it. Instead of leaving a real carabiner behind he used a toy carabiner because it was cheaper. He said “Those things only hold 500 pounds or so but I was just too cheap to leave a real carabiner.”—Kevin Kuo

Lesson: There are many ways to safely bail off a sport route. Threading the rope directly through a bolt hanger is usually not one of them. Check out the methods in this linked article and be sure to carry a couple bail carabiners or quick links in case you need to go down because you can no longer go up. Although slightly more expensive (really only a couple bucks) it’s more polite to leave carabiners. At best quick links are hard to remove for the next person that leads the route; at worst they can rust shut and become very hard to remove. Keep in mind that you may be able to retrieve gear by walking to the top of the cliff and rappelling climbing the next route over or asking a stronger friend to climb the route.

Toy carabiners usually have something like “Not for climbing” or “Not load bearing” printed right on them because they’re not load bearing. Five hundred pounds is a very generous estimate—they’re intended to hold a set of keys or maybe a water bottle absolutely not a person. If your life is worth so little to you that you’re willing to risk it instead of leaving behind gear that costs roughly the price of a hamburger then I can’t help you. You’ll get better advice from a therapist.

Belaying While Carrying a Knife

Knives and ropes don’t mix. (Photo: Getty Images)

I witnessed this mess at Poke-O-Moonshine in the Adirondacks: The guy was belaying his presumed wife up the first pitch of Gamesmanship. He had a block of cheese in one hand and an Opinel knife in the other. The knife was pointed at him and he was cutting toward himself—at least it wasn’t toward the rope! The belay device was upside down no eyes on the climber. The moment he put the knife down she fell past her last three placements. She proceeded to explain that her foot slipped and it was very unexpected. —Dylan Kunkel

Lesson: Repeat after me: No sharp objects near your climbing rope. Ever. This is such an important rule that rope manufacturers recommend you don’t use scissors to open the packaging of a new rope. Your rope is your lifeline. You should take every precaution to keep it intact. This means extending protection and anchors to keep it from running over sharp edges using a tarp to keep abrasive dirt out of the sheath when belaying and keeping knives away from it no matter how hungry you are. A rope under tension can be cut fairly easily. But even if you didn’t care about your climber’s safety this scenario also presents significant danger to the belayer. Lead belayers experience fairly chaotic jolts during a fall. If you’re holding a knife you may not be happy with where it ends up after a catch. Beyond that this belayer needs to relearn the basics. Always pay full attention to your climber. Use gear as the manufacturer recommends. And never take your hand off the brake strand. Most falls are unexpected. If you don’t have a hand on the brake strand you’re not belaying; you’re watching your climber free solo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGtpY2suY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL2F0bGFudGEtYnJhdmVzLW1hc2NvdC1ibG9vcGVyLWxheXMtb3V0LWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWR1cmluZy1yYWNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlanta Braves Mascot Blooper Lays Out Competition During Race,"Mascot races have become an endearing fixture of many stadiums around MLB with the Brewers famously featuring racing sausages at American Family Field.

Blooper may be an unidentifiable bear/alien hybrid species but that did not stop him from absolutely demolishing his competition in Friday's race during the Braves-Dodgers game.

The green Home Depot tool stood no chance against the ferocious onslaught of Blooper's Brian Dawkins-esque physical dominance:

Herbert Warburg 97 passed away peacefully on June 24 2022 in his home in Sarasota FL. Herbert (Herbie) was born on April 20 1925 in Nordhausen Germany. He was a Holocaust survivor who had spent time in the Thereisenstadt Concentration Camp during the last year of WWII. After WWII ended Herbie immigrated to the U.S. where he met his future wife Rosa in New York City in 1955.

Herbie was an electrical engineer by trade. He started his career at the RCA Institute of Technology. He was later recruited by Bendix (now Honeywell) and retired after 30 years of faithful service at age 62. He enjoyed 35 glorious years in retirement traveling nationally and internationally with his wife Rosa.

In addition to his professional life Herbie was known in the communities where he dwelled as “Mr. Fix It”. He could fix anything; from washing machines to radios and he helped his neighbors with all types of mechanical or electrical devices that might need repair.

Herbie loved the outdoors and nature and he hiked extensively in Europe and the White Mountains of New Hampshire. He was also interested in the cultural arts particularly jazz and big band music. He was an avid photographer long before the advent of digital photography and he developed his own photos.

Herbie was keenly interested in politics and he never missed the 7:00 p.m. news. He was an active member of B’Nai Brith and through a B’Nai Brith program Herbie would go with his wife to entertain and dance with the mentally disabled at a psychiatric institute at Christmas time. Herbie was a kind and gentle man with an inquisitive and analytical mind and always had a fresh perspective on current events. Finally he loved his residence in Pelican Cove FL and would always tell people he lived in the “best place on earth!”

Herbert was predeceased by his sister Eva Forst. He is much loved by Rosa his wife of 67 years daughter Helena Warburg son–in-law Ron Levinsky and granddaughter Alexandra Levinsky. He also leaves behind a very special nephew and niece Artie Forst and Renee Patterson and their children and grandchildren as well as a lifelong friend Hannelore Noe.

A celebration of life will be held at a later date.

To do that Florence is looking to its versatility as a strength.

“We have some pretty good depth at pitcher and we have some girls who can play multiple positions” coach Scott Schuler said. “We can move some things around when we have to make substitutions. We have some older girls too so we have that depth and experience.”

Florence won’t get its tournament underway until Tuesday as it awaits the winner of the game between Bordentown and Robbinsville.

“It’s been a while” Schuler said. “It’s been nice to get the girls to commit and play now. It has been a couple years so we are excited about the group that has been playing together all year.”

The team chemistry is also right where it needs to be.

“The team chemistry makes everything” Schuler said. “If you are not together then they are not going to play as a team. These girls have been playing together whether it is rec travel practices so they know each other from school and everything else. It’s been good to see them gel together.”

What does Florence need to do to have a chance to win?

“If they do the little things and don’t make any mental mistakes and stay within themselves” Schuler said. “It’s just a game so play loose and don’t get too up tight. I think we have the talent to be able to make a deep run.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uaWNsZS5jby56dy91cmdlbnQtbmVlZC1mb3ItcmV0dXJuLW9mLXNwb3J0LWF0LWdvdmVybm1lbnQtc2Nob29scy_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaHJvbmljbGUuY28uencvdXJnZW50LW5lZWQtZm9yLXJldHVybi1vZi1zcG9ydC1hdC1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LXNjaG9vbHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Urgent need for return of sport at Government schools,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.chronicle.co.zw', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /urgent-need-for-return-of-sport-at-government-schools/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000029D4B3E2800>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uaWNsZS5jby56dy91cmdlbnQtbmVlZC1mb3ItcmV0dXJuLW9mLXNwb3J0LWF0LWdvdmVybm1lbnQtc2Nob29scy_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaHJvbmljbGUuY28uencvdXJnZW50LW5lZWQtZm9yLXJldHVybi1vZi1zcG9ydC1hdC1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LXNjaG9vbHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

Latin America Hotel Investors Gain Interest in International Brands

The supply of hotels affiliated with international brands across Latin America has historically been low but investors now have growing interest in conversions as more owners understand the importance of branding according to executives speaking at the recent Hotel Opportunities Latin America conference.

""In the region there's a lot of small independent owner-operators that have their own brands with 30 or 35 hotels. They always thought their brand was more important than an international brand"" said Ricardo Mader Rodrigues CEO of Colliers Market Intelligence and Advisory. ""They see now the difference of how a strong brand [and] all the benefits they bring [can make a difference].

""We're seeing a lot of owners finally understanding the value of the brand"" he said. ""It's a great moment for franchising. It's a big change and I believe that the next few years are going to see an increase of brands in the region to franchise.""

Host Spends $530 Million on Two Nashville Hotels

Real estate investment trust Host Hotels & Resorts purchased the fee simple interest in two Nashville hotels adjacent to each other for $530 million in cash. The two hotels are the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown.

""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive revenue per available room compound annual growth rate of 7.7% from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. … We expect the property will generate outsize growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders"" Jim Risoleo Host’s president and CEO said in a news release.

In Host's first-quarter 2024 earnings call Risoleo called Nashville the ""market of the future. It's the No. 2 convention market in the United States behind Orlando.""

Hilton Continues Growth of Luxury Lifestyle Portfolio

In a pursuit to expand Hilton's luxury lifestyle hotel portfolio the company acquired a majority stake in Sydell Group to expand Sydell's NoMad Hotels brand. Hilton projects that as many as 100 NoMad hotels will roll out across the world over time.

NoMad currently has two open and operating hotels: its NoMad London and NoMad Las Vegas. The Las Vegas hotel is excluded from the deal with Hilton and will be respositioned.

Hilton will be responsible for NoMad development while Sydell will spearhead design branding and management of it. All NoMad hotels will be independently owned and rolled into Hilton's commercial platforms.

New Aimbridge CEO Details Company Strategy

In the first few months of Craig Smith taking over as CEO of global-third party management company Aimbridge Hospitality he's focused on meeting with hotel owners brand representatives and corporate teams on what can be improved.

In an exclusive virtual fireside chat with Hotel News Now Smith said some of the feedback he's heard is that the company isn't using its scale to its full advantage.

""We've got to think like a small third-party management company and less like a large company"" he said. ""In other words we use our scale for things that are important to us but our [thinking] has to be like almost a small company that's really dedicated to each owner and each hotel.""

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands.

Operating profit surged by 17.3% and the operating profit margin under GAAP improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

Need an example?

AWD

Back in 2008 the professional rally driver opened up an entire world to creatively styled automotive shenanigans with the first Gymkhana video. Almost 15 years later his Hoonigan Industries company explores just about everything from quirky drag races to crazy aftermarket build projects and everything in between.Naturally while he is out there enjoying the latest partnership with Audi Block’s Hoonigan endeavor is still diligently taking care of tradition – and that surely includes more Gymkhana videos. Remember they first started with a Subaru Impreza but then swiftly moved on to all sorts of monster Ford builds. But as Ken Block passed the Gymkhana baton – or rather the steering wheel – to his friend and equally audacious rally companion Travis Pastrana the circle came complete and Subaru of America was back into slow-motion air-time action.Just to make sure that everyone understands the generational change Pastrana has gotten another set of new wheels for 2022. Well sort of since we are dealing with a 1983 Subaru GL five-door station wagon dubbed - depending on who you ask as “The (Family) Huckster.” The actual moniker is less important than what it can do of course. This retro rally machine is yet another bonkers project by Hoonigan Industries and Subaru of America a vintage Subie that could easily rip the V8 head off a few contemporary supercars.The secret is simple – under the stickered widebody aero-enhanced GL wagon allure resides an 862-horsepower monster. By the way remember the 2020 Pastrana Subaru Airslayer STI? That one was not only used for Gymkhana but also proved its worth in ritzy competition because it shattered the Mt. Washington Hillclimb record and snatched second place at Goodwood’s Hillclimb Shootout. Now the same 862-hp boxer-four engine mated to a six-speed sequential gearbox and all-wheel drive is tucked underneath the vintage yet bonkers styling.And of course Subaru engineers had a little bit of time to refine the recipe… err or maybe not considering all the aerodynamic tricks they needed to employ to help this old-school family ride act out mental like it has got some sort of hypercar DNA. But let us give the word to Pastrana himself who said in a Motor Authority -cited statement that “the '83 wagon flies about as well as you would imagine... kind of like a brick. This makes the jumps way more sketchy but also more entertaining and less predictable. The Family Huckster is without a doubt my all-time favorite vehicle to drive.”Now following its high-profile Goodwood Festival of Speed debut all that remains is to patiently wait for Travis Pastrana Subaru and Hoonigan to do their usual magic and deliver some Gymkhana wizardry that will keep us on our toes yet again. Before that happens though it helps to know a little bit about what makes this Subie GL wagon tick.So aside from the “casual” 862-horsepower boxer engine sequential box and tricked-outsystem there is also way more bonkers stuff going on with this build. For example the retro chassis was thoroughly upgraded to survive the ordeals modern WRC technology is unseen but very present and the body is all made from carbon fiber and installed on an advanced tubular spaceframe plus one of the biggest highlights of the entire project is the active aerodynamics.Those include the carbon-fiber roof rack that was purposedly developed to direct air toward the engine’s cooling needs (via a NACA roof duct!). But that is not all. Instead the dashboard is recreated in blue carbon fiber to resemble the GL’s original unit and the 12-inch digital instrument panel is also jam-packed with retro vibes plus the Subie rides on bespoke KMC wheels made in the same style as the company’s offerings from the 1980s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2hrcy1idWlsdC1yYjI2LWNyYXRlLWVuZ2luZS1zd2FwLXIzNC1za3lsaW5lLWd0LXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,YouTuber Unboxes 800 HP HKS Built RB26 Crate Engine Will Swap Into R34 Skyline GT-R,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2hrcy1idWlsdC1yYjI2LWNyYXRlLWVuZ2luZS1zd2FwLXIzNC1za3lsaW5lLWd0LXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuaW4vYnVzaW5lc3Mvc29saXMteWFubWFyLXRvLWxhdW5jaC0zLW1vZGVscy1pbi0zMC1ocC1zZWdtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solis Yanmar to launch 3 models in >30 HP segment,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.constructionweekonline.in/business/solis-yanmar-to-launch-3-models-in-30-hp-segment on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuaW4vYnVzaW5lc3Mvc29saXMteWFubWFyLXRvLWxhdW5jaC0zLW1vZGVscy1pbi0zMC1ocC1zZWdtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The then team leader and nurse educator began their eight-year journey to create a hospice center to care for dying patients who don’t have a home or caregivers at the end of their life.

On Friday community leaders and advocates toured Grace House Akron which will provide end-of-life care and support for residents who are homeless or in financial need.

Grace House Akron hopes to have its first residents by the end of July. Supply-chain issues have delayed the electrical work at the house.

“This is a very peaceful place to be” said Nick Browning president of the Mahoning/Akron/Canton Huntington Bank region and president of the Grace House board said Friday during the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

“Our job is to help those who are terminally ill and have no money and no one to take care of you at the end of your life. To do that without somebody by your side or by your bedside is a lonely thing. We are dedicated to making sure that everyone has the opportunity to die with dignity and not to die alone” said Browning who is also co-founder of Grace House Akron with his wife Cindy and Klein.

How will Grace House Akron work?

Grace House Akron is a nonprofit organization with 70 community members who have served on various boards to get it ready. There are 60 volunteers trained and Klein is serving as executive director.

Hospice care often is paid for by Medicare and Medicaid. Some patients stay at inpatient facilities such as those run by Summa Health or Cleveland Clinic Akron General.

But under federal Medicare guidelines only the most seriously ill patients or those who are days or hours from death and are in severe pain are usually in those facilities.

Home hospice benefits don’t cover basic caregiver services such as 24-hour care or feeding.

At Grace House hospice services will be provided by other professionals through Medicaid Medicare or indigent-care programs said Klein.

The caregiving and all services provided by Grace House will be free for patients.

The organization raised $4 million. The city of Akron and Summit County provided $300000 each to get the group to its financial goal which includes two years of operations.

Continued fundraising and applications for grants will fund the house moving forward said Klein.

The name Grace House was chosen because the word grace “in many languages means favor or gift” said Klein a hospice nurse for 20 years. Organizers modeled the house after a similar charity called Malachi House in Cleveland.

The 6300-square-feet house has six private bedrooms each with its own bathroom. Food services will be provided by volunteer chefs.

Volunteers will be key

Volunteers will be the heart of caregiving services including massages music and art therapy pet therapy spiritual needs and companionship.

“We will have volunteers around the clock but most of the volunteers will be 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. I would love to see us hit 100 and that could include people just dropping off meals” said Klein. “Our goal is that our caregivers assisted by volunteers in four-hour shifts.”

Volunteers can “just come in and sit with the resident. If a resident has a hobby the volunteer can come in and play cards or do puzzles. When the courtyard is done later this fall there will be gardening and upkeep needs” said Klein.

There also will be “vigil companions” to have someone sitting with a resident as the person is dying she said.

Volunteer applications can be found on the house’s website www.gracehouseakron.org/

There will be a total of about 10 full-time and part-time staffers at Grace House said Klein. Cindy Browning will serve as an unpaid full-time assistant director.

Information for those seeking care

Klein said she anticipates the six-bedroom house getting filled quickly with a waiting list as soon as it is ready for residents in late July. Grace House will work with hospice programs to coordinate care.

Potential residents or people who know of someone in need of hospice care without the financial means can also call Grace House and Klein said staff will help get care coordinated. Call 800-715-1156.

To qualify for the free hospice program patients must prove they can’t afford a caregiver or don’t have access to a caregiver.

“Initially our length of stay is going to be shorter because we’re going to triage the ones with the most need. We’ll look at symptoms home environment and whether it’s safe” said Klein. “As time goes on I think our length of stay will lengthen. I would love 45 days.""

The national average stay at a hospice is seven days or less for 30% of hospice provider admissions Klein said. She anticipates Grace House will have similar stays.

“Some will be longer some will be shorter. I hope somebody wouldn’t come in and pass away right away that we would have a little more” she said.

Grace House located near St. Thomas Hospital

A public open house will be held from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday June 25.

The house was built on land purchased in May 2019 near Summa St. Thomas Hospital from Summa Health for $10.

The 0.7-acre corner lot is at 475 N. Howard St. at Olive Street (also known as Dr. Bob’s Way in honor of the Alcoholics Anonymous co-founder).

Summa CEO Dr. Cliff Deveny said the health system is happy to be a part of the Grace House efforts. Summa was also pleased to provide the land for the house for a deeply discounted rate he said.

“The neighborhood is transitioning with the International Institute homes next door and Summa will soon be decommissioning St. Thomas (hospital) and hoping to continue with the evolution of this neighborhood to see it come back” Deveny said. Summa is building a new 60-bed behavioral health facility on the Akron City Hospital campus to transfer care from St. Thomas. It is slated to be completed by the first quarter of 2023.

Akron Mayor Dan Horrigan said he has watched Grace House being built as he drove past the lot on his way home daily.

“It’s more than an empty lot. It’s exactly the testament of what this community is and that’s with its hand wide open and its heart taking care of people” said the mayor.

Community reaction

Community members and volunteers who toured the facility on Friday said they were looking forward to opening the doors to residents.

“I’m just delighted to have this here and see Holly’s vision and the Brownings’ vision come to bear” said Anthony Burwell a chaplain at Summa Hospice and an elder at St. Ashworth Temple Church of God in Christ in Akron who is also president of the board for Red Oak Behavioral Health.

Kevin DeJournett a Summa hospice chaplain who will be volunteering and will serve on the spiritual advisory board said: “Dying alone is just something that I don’t even want to imagine. Dying with dignity means a lot to the patient who is dying and us as well.”

The event spanned the grounds of the Century Village Museum in Burton. Large rainbow balloon displays designed by balloon artist Extra Betty greeted visitors along with music yard games face painting and more. Exhibitors set up tables in the Lennah Bond Activity Center where visitors could learn more about their organizations and missions.

Ginger Marshall administrative coordinator for the MetroHealth Pride Network was there to inform attendees about the network’s doctors and to learn more about the other exhibitors and organizations in attendance.

Marshall described the network’s mission as “healthcare for LGBTQ+ people that is caring and competent and knowledgeable and life-spanning from cradle to grave; for kids of LGBTQ parents.” The network’s website mentioned that its doctors address general health needs as well as those specific to LGBTQ+ patients.

Dick and Jan Hurwitz came to represent East Shore Unitarian Universalist Church from Kirtland.

“We’re here because we believe in diversity of all kinds” said Dick Hurwitz. “We don’t have one set of beliefs that everybody has to ascribe to. We help each person in the church find their own spiritual path.”

Chris Steigerwald president of the board for the Geauga SOGI Support Network said other attendees included advocacy groups such as Equality Ohio and TransOhio; Camp Lilac; LGBTQ+ health representatives from University Hospitals Cleveland Clinic and Signature Health; the Social Justice Advocacy Ministry from Federated Church in Chagrin Falls; Bainbridge United Church of Christ; Community Church of Chesterland; Lake Geauga Recovery Center; Kent State University Geauga Campus; PFLAG Cleveland; and League of Women Voters.

Exhibitors including health care networks churches advocacy organizations and more gathered inside the Lennah Bond Activity Center at the Burton Century Village Museum for Pride in Geauga. (Bryson Durst -- The News-Herald).

The network with the SOGI in its name standing for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity was founded in January 2020 noted Steigerwald. She said that the organization’s mission is “to engage with individuals families friends and the Geauga community to embrace sexual orientation and gender identity through collaboration education and advocacy.

“We want the youth to feel more comfortable feel that they are accepted that they’re embraced and supported” she said.

Due to the pandemic Steigerwald said that the network did not hold major community events in its first two years. Organizers chose Century Village because it has a large property is “centrally located in the Geauga community” and is private so the organization could ask individuals to leave if it deemed necessary. An officer from the Burton Village Police Department stood watch at the entrance near the parking lot.

Steigerwald said that there were community members both in favor of and against Pride in Geauga. Speaking on June 22 of the previous night’s Burton Village Council meeting Steigerwald said “It was all very respectful last night but definitely there’s disagreement. But in the process of that we have people reaching out and thanking us for being there for speaking up for having this event.”

Steigerwald noted that the Geauga SOGI Support Network has support groups for LGBTQ+ middle and high school students as well as the parents of individuals who identify as transgender or nonbinary. The network also holds outreach programs with organizations such as churches schools social service agencies and more and is planning to begin work with organizations such as the Community Life Collaborative which Steigerwald described as an organization that offers “programming and education around social justice issues like immigration and the environment.”",,,,,,,,,

“Today the USS Montana is tested and battle ready” Chris Jessel executive officer of the submarine said as more than 100 Montanans sat in the audience at Naval Station Norfolk.

The $2.6 billion Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarine will add the next generation of stealth surveillance and special warfare capabilities to the Navy fleet officials said.

Gov. Greg Gianforte spoke as he stood near a banner for the submarine that read: “Vigilantes of the deep” a nickname adopted by the crew in an homage to the state’s period of vigilante justice in the 1800s.

“Now more than ever American strength on the world stage is needed” he said. “Today the world’s most powerful advanced and capable Navy adds to its fleet one of the most sophisticated submarines ever built.”

Gianforte said missions conducted on the USS Montana SSN 794 will make the nation and world more secure. He hoped the submarine’s crew members would draw strength from the state’s value of resilience talking about recent flooding that ravaged communities.

“I am proud honored and humbled you will carry that resilience to all corners of the world in the service of our nation” he said adding he knew the submarine would live up to its name.

The 70-minute ceremony was held dockside with the submarine serving as a backdrop. It was christened Sept. 12 2020 by former secretary of the interior Sally Jewell. She attended Saturday’s ceremony which included a performance by a Native American drum group from Montana. Also a C-130 from the Montana Air National Guard in Great Falls flew overhead toward the end of the ceremony.

Gianforte said several of Montana’s tribal nations were represented at the ceremony.

“Tribal communities in Montana have a long and decorated history of military service” he said.

Jewell noted Mariah Gladstone a member of the Blackfeet Tribe is serving as maid of honor. She said Gladstone gave a blessing and smudged the vessel using bird sage to bless the boat.

“With awe I have witnessed the USS Montana emerge as an extraordinary element of our national defense” she said praising all those who worked on the submarine and their families.

“I am confident the USS Montana will play a key role in furthering freedom around the world and also confident she will live up to the spirit of adventure and resilience of her namesake state” Jewell said.

Admiral Frank Caldwell said the Montana would patrol the frontiers of the world’s oceans.

“This is a great day for Montana and a great day for our submarine force” he said.

Bill Whitsitt chair and director of the USS Montana Committee a nonprofit which has raised nearly $200000 over five years for the submarine said Saturday the commissioning was the “peak” the group has been looking forward to.

“It was a powerful emotional and joyful time to see the ship come to life and see the sailors a number of us have gotten to know … it was truly amazing” he said.

He said the committee changed its bylaws several days ago to say its mission does not end with the commissioning and plans to be the support group for the submarine for its entire 30-year life.

Some speakers compared the vastness of the ocean to Montana’s skies.

“The Montana big sky spirit will carry our vigilantes of the deep through many challenges and the missions ahead even when its crew cannot see the sky” Erik Raven under secretary of the Navy said.

Raven officially placed the ship into commission.

“May God bless and guide this warship and all who sail in her” he said.

Jon Quimby commander of the USS Montana said the submarine has undergone sea trials and the crew has put in more than 6000 nautical miles already.

“I am proud to serve with you and for you and I know we are ready to take on any challenges thrown our way” he told the crew.

The 7800-ton Virginia-class submarine was built by Newport News Shipbuilding – Huntington Ingalls Industries and General Dynamics Electric Boat.

Jennifer Boykin president of Newport News Shipbuilding said Saturday the USS Montana commissioning was particularly special as much of its construction took place during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

She said even in the most trying of times Montanans kept in touch virtually on the submarine’s progress.

“We felt the spirit of the whole state of Montana all the way” she said adding the commissioning was a testament to the dedication by the shipbuilding and Navy team.

Virginia-class submarines which are nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines will replace the Navy’s Los Angeles-class submarines as they are retired. The submarines incorporate dozens of new technologies that increase firepower maneuverability and stealth and enhance their warfighting capabilities. They have 12 Tomahawk missile tubes and four torpedo tubes according to the U.S. Department of Defense. It is the 21st Virginia-class submarine to be delivered to the Navy.

The submarine has a Montana theme throughout. Passageways are named for Montana rivers such as the Missouri Flathead Gallatin Jefferson Madison and Yellowstone. The lowest part of the boat which has one hallway is called Bitterroot.

Berthing areas where sailors sleep are named for Montana places and towns such as Helena and Kalispell.

The crew mess area includes a Glacier Park panorama requested by Quimby.

And the crew dining area is called the Big Sky Saloon. Currently two of the 135 crew members are from Montana but that number fluctuates.

Other Montana touches include a genuine peace pipe to be presented by Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes elder and made by a Blackfeet artist.

For the past five years members of the crew have visited Montana and attended rodeos in Bigfork and parades in Kalispell. And committee members have taken the ship’s bell around the state. It’s a replica of the bell aboard the first USS Montana and honors the state motto of oro y plata (gold and silver). Melted into it are Montana gold and silver as well as gold and silver dolphin pins worn by submariners.

The first and only commissioned USS Montana was an armored cruiser added to the U.S. Navy fleet in 1908. Known as armored cruiser No. 13 it was decommissioned in 1921. It was renamed the Missoula and served in the reserve fleet until 1930.

The USS Montana will remain in the shipyard for a few months where it will have its software updated. It will then be moved to the Pacific fleet and be based in Hawaii.

Saturday’s ceremony included a closing prayer to the Creator by Gene Sorrell an elder with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes.

""The USS Montana I pray you become one with the water work together for protection of our homelands"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR2aWRzaHViLm5ldC9pbWFnZS83MjkwMDIwL25hdmFsLWhpc3RvcnktaGVyaXRhZ2UtY29tbWFuZC1zdXBwb3J0cy11c3MtbW9udGFuYS1zc24tNzk0LWNvbW1pc3Npb25pbmctYWN0aXZpdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Naval History & Heritage Command supports USS Montana (SSN-794) commissioning activities,"Mimosa Whiting assigned to the Communication & Outreach Division at the Naval History and Heritage Command and MMA1(SS) George Horning assigned to the Historic Ship Nautilus interact with guests on Saturday 25 June 2022 during the commissioning of USS Montana (SSN-794) at Naval Station Norfolk. Montana is the 21st Virginia Class submarine co-produced by General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB) and Huntington Ingalls Industries-Newport News Shipbuilding (HII-NNS). Montana is the second U.S. Navy ship to honor the state. The first USS Montana (ACR-13) an armored cruiser was also built at Newport News Shipbuilding and commissioned July 1908. She served in the Atlantic and Mediterranean landed Marines during unrest in Haiti in 1914 and escorted convoys during World War I. She was decommissioned in 1921. Two other battleships (BB-51 and BB-67) were to have been named Montana however were cancelled in 1922 and 1943 respectively. (US Navy Photo by Max Lonzanida/Released).

Then his parents did. Now he does and he has. For six decades.

For 60 of his 67 years Hovan has used his green thumb to nurture those red fruits.

Gardening publicly in community gardens he’s taken on a likely nickname: “Tomato Man.”

Years and plots

Back in 2010 the nonprofit organization Racine Urban Garden Network started leasing an acre of land at 734 Marquette St. with ambitious plans to construct a community garden. Now over a decade later the land now known as Marquette Community Garden has “ex-seeded” expectations.

There are now more than 10 community gardens around the Racine area all beginning to flower around this time of year.

Hovan was among one of the first to get a plot at the gardens after his family moved here 12 years ago.

“This year I have 77 tomato plants growing from 26 different varieties” Hovan said while tending to his personal plot on Marquette Street last week. He is also growing six different types of peppers as well as broccoli and cauliflower plants.

Having gardened for over 60 years Hovan spoke about nostalgic memories from his adolescence that added to his ardent love for horticulture. Besides visiting his personal plot almost daily Hoven also still works full-time at Illinois Tool Works.

The key to cultivating and maintaining a lush garden plot? Effort and hard work.

“Gardens are not made by singing ‘Oh how beautiful’ and sitting in the shade” Hovan said. “It does take patience and dedication; sometimes you’re fighting the elements.”

That said he welcomes any unforeseen challenges and affirms that beyond being a source of fresh fruits and vegetables the journey of enjoying the trifecta of seeds soil and sun is absolutely “worth it.”

“I do it for the fun of it” Hovan said.

Marquette Community Garden still has plenty of plot spaces available for rent. After the initial rental fee the garden provides access to fresh water garden tools and storage space.

Seed of four O. australiensis populations was collected from the monsoonal savannah region of northern Australia (Fig. 1) compliant with the relevant national and international guidelines and legislation for wild species collections. All seed was obtained from the Australian Tropical Crops and Forages Collection (AusTRCF) of the Australian Grains Genebank (previously the Australian Plant Genetic Resource Information System) and as part of the Australian Tropical Crops Genetic Resource Centre Collection (ATCGRC). The Keep River accession used for the reference genome assembly bears the accession number AusTRCF 318143 and was collected by Dr I. Cowie at Darwin Herbarium Northern Territory Australia (Voucher ID# 9583) on 2nd May 2002 from a drying creek bed in the Keep River National Park after the passing of the summer monsoon. The other three accessions used for re-sequencing (CH D and VR) are held in the same collection with accession numbers of AusTRCF 300134 300137 and 300131. These lines are vouchered in the Jeff Corfield Collection in Townsville (Queensland Australia) under the accession numbers JC 2317 JC 2336 and JC 2312 respectively. CH D and VR were collected from the sites denoted in Fig. 1 between 1995 and 1997 by Mr I. Watson. Seed was stored at 4 °C until used. Seeds were imbibed in water for one hour and then surface sterilised in a 50% sodium hypochlorite bleach solution for 30 min followed by rinsing. Sterile seeds were sown onto absorbent cotton-lined petri dishes and incubated at 34 °C for 2 days to trigger germination. Germinated seeds were sown into a fine textured krasnozem soil (sourced from Robertson NSW Australia) and covered in a thin layer of vermiculite. Plants were grown in glasshouses at Macquarie University (Sydney Australia) under a 30 °C/22 °C day/night cycle in April–June 2019.

DNA extraction

Roughly 1 g of healthy fully expanded leaf material was collected from ~ 2-month-old O. australiensis plants (one plant per genotype) and ground in a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen until a fine powder was achieved. High molecular-weight DNA was extracted at the Australian National University (ANU; Canberra Australia) following the method of Jones et al.27.

Nanopore library preparation sequencing and base calling

The sequencing library was prepared as per the manufacturer’s (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Oxford United Kingdom) instructions for genomic DNA by ligation method (SQK-LSK109) with small modifications. The manufacturer recommends using 0.2 pmol of DNA however this is optimised for DNA fragments 8 kbp in length. As we were working with substantially longer (~ 20 kbp) DNA fragments we loaded 3 μg (0.23 pmol) of DNA.

The library was run on FLO-MIN106 (R9.4.1 revD) flowcells as per the manufacturer’s instructions. To obtain a good level of coverage of the O. australiensis KR genome the same library preparation for this sample was loaded onto three separate flow cells (i.e. the genomic DNA from one plant was sequenced on three flowcells). The raw signal intensities obtained from the flow cells were used by guppy (version 3.0.3) from ONT to perform base calling.

Illumina sequencing

Aliquots (containing 2.24 ng DNA) of the same DNA samples from the four O. australiensis genotypes described above were prepared for Illumina short read sequencing. Short-read libraries were created using the Illumina Nextera tagment DNA enzyme (TDE1) according to Jones et al.28. Libraries were size selected for 350–600 bp fragments using a PippinHT (Sage Science). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell 300 cycles (150 bp paired end) being multiplexed with other projects. Sequencing was performed at the Biomolecular Resource Facility ANU.

PacBio Iso-Seq library preparation and sequencing

Young grains were harvested during the milky period of development from mature O. australiensis KR plants from the same collection as the individual used for ONT and Illumina sequencing (i.e. different plants from the same population; germinated as above and grown in a glasshouse at 30 °C with ambient light at The Plant Accelerator University of Adelaide Adelaide South Australia from February to June 2020). Some developing grain still possessed their pedicel/rachilla and pollen-containing anthers and these were included in the samples to increase the diversity of transcripts in the RNA library.

The growth zones of ten 115-day-old O. australiensis KR plants were excised and used for RNA extraction. The growth zone is defined here as ~ 10 mm from the base of the youngest leaves emanating from the central cylinder of the plants. It was necessary to remove surrounding leaf sheathes to access the central cylinder.

A separate cohort of O. australiensis KR plants was germinated as above except germination was achieved with an incubation temperature of 30 °C. Germinated seeds were transferred to a growth rack partially submerged in a ½ Hoaglands solution (pH 5.01) spiked with 25 mg/L ferrous sulphate. After seven days of growth root tips (5 mm from the end of the root) older seminal roots with young lateral roots and healthy fully expanded leaves were harvested snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C. The growth solution was changed once during this time.

An additional cohort of O. australiensis KR seed was germinated at 30 °C and submerged in water in the dark to promote coleoptile growth. After six days under these conditions etiolated coleoptiles were harvested as above.

Total RNA was extracted from the six tissues (7-day-old leaves 7-day-old root tips 7-day-old mature root sections 6-day-old hypoxic coleoptiles reproductive tissue and 118-day-old growth zones) with the Sigma Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications for the developing grain sample as per Betts et al.29. RNA samples were dried in RNA Stable tubes as per the manufacturer’s instructions and shipped to DNA Link (Seoul South Korea). RNA quality and concentration of the samples were checked with a Nanodrop and with a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent Santa Clara USA). Only low-quality RNA (RIN < 7) could be extracted from the older seminal roots so this sample was omitted from further analyses.

RNA samples were barcoded upon conversion to cDNA libraries (to facilitate multiplexing) following the manufacturer’s instructions of the SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis kit. cDNA libraries were amplified by PCR and then an equal concentration of cDNA from each was pooled into a single library. The library was prepared for SMRTbell sequencing with the Express Template Prep 2.0 kit. Iso-Seq sequencing was carried out on a Sequel II PacBio instrument using a single SMRT cell.

Iso-Seq reads were processed through the IsoSeq v3 pipeline to generate high quality polished isoforms. Briefly raw data is converted from multiple subreads per ZMW into a single consensus CCS read (minimum read quality of 0.9) demultiplexed and clustered (minimum predicted accuracy of 0.99). The aim of the clustering step is to collapse the CCS reads derived from different isoforms of the same gene or from the same transcript isoform but which differ slightly in their 5′ and 3′ ends typically as a result of RNA degradation.

Nuclear genome assembly and assessment

A summary of all reads obtained during this study can be found in Table 1. Jellyfish (RRID:SCR_005491)30 and genomescope2 (RRID:SCR_017014)3132 were used to estimate the size unique sequence content and heterozygosity of the O. australiensis KR genome using 17-mers in the KR Illumina short read libraries. Raw MinION reads for O. australiensis KR were corrected and then de novo assembled using Canu v1.9 (RRID:SCR_015880)33 as follows: canu -p oryza -d canu genomeSize = 965 m -nanopore-raw all.fastq.gz -gridOptions = ""–time = 72:00:00"" -obtovlThreads = 24 -batMemory = 9. The MinION long reads and the Illumina short reads were mapped to the resulting contigs using minimap2 v2.17 (RRID:SCR_018550)34. Alignment files were used to polish the genome assembly with HyPo v1.0.335. JVarkit was used to visualise long-read coverage of the contigs36. Contigs were checked for microbial contamination by querying BLAST-generated taxon ID numbers with the lineage command of taxonkit v0.6.037. Contigs found to contain non-eukaryotic sequences were interrogated using the online genome browser IGV-Web (RRID:SCR_011793) by mapping long reads back to the assembly and checking the coverage and overlap of long reads with non-suspect sequences38. Purge Haplotigs (v1.1.2) was used to determine whether the wild rice genome assembly contained any haplotigs or junk sequences39.

Table 1 Summary of reads used for each step of genome assembly polishing variant detection and annotation. Full size table

The quality of the genome assembly was assessed by analysing the quality of the LTR-RT elements of the O. australiensis KR genome. LTR-RT elements are difficult to assemble. As such LTR-RT assemblies provide a proxy for the quality of the rest of the genome. LTR regions were identified with LTR_Finder_Parallel v1.1 (RRID:SCR_018969)40 and LTR_Harvest41. The outputs were used as input for LTR_Retriever v2.8.7 (RRID:SCR_017623)—to generate LTR Assembly Index (LAI) scores42. The quality of the assembly was also assessed with BUSCO v4 (RRID:SCR_015008)43 using the Poales database (poales_odb10.2019-11-20; contains 4896 sequences) as the lineage. Contigs were mapped to the O. sativa Nipponbare reference genome (GCA_001433935.1) with minimap2 and visualised with MashMap v2.044.

Pseudomolecules for the assembly were generated using RagTag v1.0.045 using version 7 of the O. sativa Nipponbare reference genome46 as a guide for the ordering and orientation of contigs into pseudomolecules (Supplementary File S1a). Contigs that could not be assigned to a pseudomolecule were concatenated (with 100 Ns at contig boundaries) into a ‘chromosome’ called ChrUn though we used the unassigned contigs themselves for most of the downstream analyses. To understand why the unassigned contigs could not be placed into a pseudomolecule the identity of a random subset of the unassigned contigs was determined by BLAST searches and the average LTR content of ChrUn was determined by LTR_Retriever. Contigs flagged as repeats haplotigs or junk by Purge Haplotigs were kept in the assembly for completeness but were not included in scaffolding (see above). JVarkit’s WGSplotter was used to visualise long-read genome coverage36. BLAST was used to determine the identity of a random subset of the unassigned contigs. Subsequent annotation of the unassigned contigs (see below) also helped in determining the identity of the sequences that could not be assembled into pseudomolecules. The quality of the scaffolded assembly was assessed again with BUSCO and LAI scores as above. LTR_Retriever was also used to produce estimates for LTR-RT insertion times. The quality of the assembly was further checked by mapping ONT long reads to the pseudomolecules to obtain a read mapping rate and to estimate read coverage across the assembly.

Comparison of O. australiensis KR assembly to the O. sativa Nipponbare assembly

The EDTA-masked (see below) pseudomolecules were aligned to the Nipponbare genome using minimap2 with the ‘asm20’ setting. The mapping file was used as input for dotPlotly47 to generate a dot plot of the whole-genome alignment with the following settings: “-m 2000 -q 500000 -k 12 -l -p 12”. The resulting plot was used to interrogate suspected structural variations (SVs) in the wild rice genome. We used O. sativa vs O. punctata Chr2 (CM002489.2; a BB genome rice) O. sativa vs O. australiensis KR Chr2 and O. australiensis KR vs O. punctata Chr2 alignments to inspect a region on Chr2 in these species which has been reported as an inversion in non-AA rice genome1. Alignments were made as described above except “-m 5000” was used for dotPlotly visualisation. To check whether reference bias in the O. australiensis scaffolds was affecting the Chr2 SVs we scaffolded the KEEP contigs using the O. punctata reference genome (AVCL0200000). We aligned the O. punctata-guided O. australiensis Chr2 to O. punctata Chr2 and then to O. sativa Nipponbare Chr2 as above.

To check whether the SVs were real contig coordinates within the scaffolds were extracted from the RagTag AGP file and these were used to build a ‘cytoband’ file for karyoploteR48. The coordinates for the SVs (± 10 kbp) identified in the O. australiensis KR and O. sativa genome alignment were added to the ‘cytoband’ file and these were used to visualise the boundaries between contigs and SV events using karyoploteR. Further long reads were mapped to the O. australiensis KR scaffolds to check the level of coverage across SV junctions. SV junctions with low coverage were coloured red to identify them as suspicious.

To identify single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the wild rice genome O. australiensis KR Illumina short reads were mapped to the Nipponbare genome with minimap2. The resulting BAM file was used as input for the SAMtools (RRID:SCR_002105)49 sub-command mpileup and BCFtools (RRID:SCR_005227) called SNV variants. VCFtools (RRID:SCR_001235)50 filtered low quality SNVs with low-read support (minQ = 30; minDP = 3). High quality SNVs were visualised using karyoploteR in RStudio with a window size of 70 kbp.

Genome repeat annotation

LTR_Retriever (see above) was used to provide an estimate of LTR-RT elements in the O. australiensis KR contigs and scaffolds. Repetitive DNA elements were annotated using the Extensive de novo TE Annotator (EDTA; Supplementary File S2b)51. A manually curated rice repeat-element library provided by the developers of EDTA was used to identify repeats in the O. australiensis KR genome. A library containing O. sativa ssp. japonica transcript sequences including untranslated regions (UTRs) was downloaded from the IOMAP Genomes Database52 and used by EDTA to mask endogenous genes from its annotation pipelines. EDTA also identifies repeat sequences in the input genome that were not part of the repeat library used for interrogation and then constructs a repeat library specific to the input assembly. Total repeat content was also estimated and annotated using the RepeatMasker-based Repeat Masking tool included in OmicsBox version 2.0.105354. The custom O. australiensis KR-specific repeat library generated by EDTA was used as input for the RMBlast search engine while other settings were left as default.

Protein-coding gene annotation

Evidence-based gene-finding was carried out with the OmicsBox Gene Finding tool with O. sativa set as the most closely related species5354. A protein evidence file containing protein sequences from 12 species/accessions of rice downloaded from the IOMAP Genomes Database52 and the Iso-Seq isoforms were used as evidence for gene finding. Genes were searched on both strands of the pseudomolecules and the unassigned contigs and alternative splice variants were allowed. The resulting gene coordinates were used as input for the built-in Functional Gene Annotation workflow. This workflow uses RepeatMasker to mask repeat elements in the genome assembly before carrying out gene prediction with Augustus. Then both Blast2GO and InterProScan pipelines were applied to search for gene and protein matches for the identified genes. Annotations were further supplemented by searching orthologues of the identified genes/proteins using EggNOG-mapper in OmicsBox. Annotations for the contigs and scaffolds were exported as GFF3 files (Supplementary Files S3c S4d). To check whether the GFF3 files contained TE gene annotations we used a list of known plant TE families from the Atlas of Plant Transposable Elements55.

O. australiensis genotype diversity and genetic similarity

To identify SNVs between four genotypes of O. australiensis with demonstrated differences in salt tolerance20 the O. australiensis CH D and VR Illumina short reads (Table 1) were mapped to the scaffolded O. australiensis KR genome assembly using minimap2 and visualised as above. Keep River short reads were also mapped back against the Keep River genome to provide a baseline of SNVs. Mpileup was used to call variants between the O. australiensis KR genome assembly and the mapped reads. VCF files were filtered using bcftools such that only reads with a mapping quality > 30 and only SNVs with a depth of 5× were considered. The patterns of SNV density described here were visually inspected.

Genetic similarity between the O. australiensis genotypes was determined using the Illumina short reads for each genotype as input for kWIP56. kWIP uses a Weighted Inner Product of different k-mer hash values derived from khmer (RRID:SCR_001156)57 to reduce the effect that erroneous read data has on estimates of genetic similarity. The estimate of genetic similarity was also extended to the Oryza genus using publicly available Illumina short read data derived from genomic DNA samples (see Supplementary File S5e for the list of accessions).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDQ4OTY5NzIyMDE0NDUw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Short- and long-read metagenomics insight into the genetic contexts and hosts of mobile antibiotic resistome in ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722014450 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDQ4OTY5NzIyMDE0NDUw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The ceremony which was originally set to take place on July 22nd has been delayed indefinitely in a likely bid to push the US government towards passing the CHIPS Act.

“There is no reason that we should not pass this bill through Congress in July”

Intel told US lawmakers and government officials that it’s delaying its ceremony “due in part to uncertainty around” the CHIPS Act according to an email viewed by the WSJ. In a statement to The Verge Intel spokesperson William Moss reiterates that the “scope and pace” of the company’s project rely on funding from the CHIPS Act. “Unfortunately CHIPS Act funding has moved more slowly than we expected and we still don’t know when it will get done” Moss adds.

Moss goes on to say “it is time for Congress to act” so the company can “move forward at the speed and scale” for its projects in and outside of Ohio. Although Intel has delayed its groundbreaking ceremony Moss says it hasn’t pushed back plans to begin building its facilities. Construction is still set to commence in late 2022 with production starting in 2025.

“We expressed our belief that there is no reason that we should not pass this bill through Congress in July” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement following a meeting about the chip-related legislation on Tuesday.

Congress faces mounting pressure from Intel and other government officials to pass a final version of the CHIPS Act before the Congressional recess in August. As noted by The Post officials are concerned that Congress’ slow action on the bill could cause semiconductor companies to turn their attention away from the US.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9pbnRlbC1jcHUtYXV0by1vdmVyY2xvY2stcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtbWF4aW1pemVyLDYxNzktMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Performance Maximizer (IPM) Tested: One-Click Overclocking Comes to 9th-Gen CPUs,"IPM vs. Precision Boost Overdrive and MCE Test Setup

Intel Performance Maximizer vs. Precision Boost Overdrive

AMD's Precision Boost Overdrive is a boon to enthusiasts with its adaptive overclocking approach and it's making its way from the Threadripper platform to all of AMD's Ryzen 3000 processors. The software allows the processor to communicate with the platform to modulate performance based on the motherboard's power delivery subsystem and thermal dissipation capabilities.

The processor monitors Package Power Tracking (PPT) and Thermal Design Current (TDC) variables measuring available margin to the motherboard's maximum power output and current respectively. Electrical Design Current (EDC) also indicates the maximum current possible from the VRMs during peak/transient conditions. A control loop feeds real-time telemetry data back to the processor which then dynamically adjusts performance based on thermal and power conditions. AMD also exposes some of these monitoring features with its Ryzen Master overclocking software.

In contrast Intel's Performance Maximizer is a one-click auto tuner that finds the maximum attainable all-core overclock and then applies fixed settings based upon many of the same variables like the power delivery and cooling capabilities. Like AMD's implementation you still get the benefit of boost clocks that outstrip the all-core frequency when the processor isn't fully loaded but Intel's overclock will not improve based upon a change in conditions like the installation of a better power supply or cooler that could unlock higher clocks. In that case you'll have to run the application again.

Intel's tool also monitors the system to detect if it has BSODs within three minutes of booting up. If the system generates more than three blue screens the tool will no longer apply the overclock and send a message that it has reverted due to instability. It also gives the option to re-run the utility to regain a stable overclock.

Intel Performance Maximizer vs. Multi-Core Enhancement (MCE)

Intel's motherboard partners have already infused their boards with predefined all-core boost profiles that go by many names such as Multi-Core Enhancement (MCE) with ASUS motherboards and Enhanced Turbo with our MSI motherboard. These features are largely referred to as MCE but the functionality remains the same: These settings essentially apply an all-core overclock to the processor that is defined by the maximum Turbo Boost bin supported by the processor. This setting modifies the CPU's clock rate and voltage to deliver higher performance which is basically factory-sanctioned overclocking.

Motherboard vendors predetermine the voltage settings at the factory meaning the settings do not take chip quality into account. Instead the vendor bins a large number of CPUs in each respective SKU and sets the parameters based on the worst common denominator. As such these settings typically use a much higher voltage than required for even chips of ""normal"" quality which can reduce the chips' lifespan and result in a hotter and noisier system.

Again MSI turns this on by default in its BIOS similar to most of its competition. Performance power consumption and heat are all affected naturally. We manually disable this feature for our stock CPU testing to best reflect Intel's specifications but we're enabling it for some of this testing to compare its performance with the IPM tool.

MEG Z390 Godlike

We're using MSI's MEG Z390 Godlike as our test platform. This pricey board retails for $600 but has the power delivery subsystem to support aggressive overclocking.

The MEG Z390 Godlike sits at the top of MSI's motherboard hierarchy on Intel's mainstream platform. It has a decked-out 18-phase power delivery subsystem that's designed to squeeze every drop of performance out of Intel's new processors.

As mentioned we left the memory settings at DDR4-2666 to reflect a normal users' one-click overclocking efforts. We disabled the Multi-Core Enhanced feature for all tests except those explicitly listed.

Arc GPUs are currently only available in China with Intel planning to expand across the global market in the near future.

The new Arc M-series cards have been floating around in laptops in China for weeks now while the very first desktop GPU has just launched in partnership with Chinese manufacturer Gunnir (although it’s being sold at exorbitant prices right now ). That card is the Intel Arc A380 a name that might sound a little familiar to anyone with more than a passing interest in aviation.

The A380 is the world’s largest passenger aircraft developed by Airbus to challenge the iconic Boeing 747 and produced from 2007 to 2021. A double-decker ‘airliner’ with standard capacity for over 500 passengers the A380 is a common sight at airports these days especially for long-haul flights to and from the Asia-Pacific region. If you’ve ever flown with Emirates or Quantas there’s a good chance you’ve sat aboard an A380.

Here’s the important bit: ‘A380’ is a registered trademark owned by Airbus. As a helpful reader flagged up to us this could potentially land Intel in hot water over marketing the new GPUs using the A380 name. Trademark law is a murky complicated business at the best of times and some companies will pursue possible infringements aggressively to protect their trademarks - which could spell trouble for Intel.

Does Airbus have a lawsuit?

Naturally I spoke to Intel about this. After a few days of deliberation with its legal team it concluded that there was no danger of a lawsuit and as such declined to offer an official statement on the matter. To understand why Intel feels that it’s safe though we’re going to need a brief primer on trademark law.

I’ll try to keep this as brief and not-boring as possible because let's be honest: trademark law isn’t exactly the most riveting topic. The key thing it boils down to is the ‘likelihood of confusion’ - usually for a trademark lawsuit to succeed a judge has to rule that there is a non-zero chance that a consumer could get confused between two non-generic products based on the name.

Now in this case it would seem that Intel is in the clear already; nobody in their right mind is going to confuse a graphics card with a gigantic airplane after all. Additionally Airbus actually uses some Intel processor hardware in its aircraft so ticking off Intel seems like it would be a bad idea.

But Airbus’ trademark listing does include reference to marketing materials bearing the A380 mark indicating that Airbus might have some grounds to launch a legal offensive. Intel is obviously confident; I’d imagine that its legal team wouldn’t have greenlit the name if they were concerned since the A380 plane isn’t exactly a secret. Partnering with Gunnir for a China-exclusive initial launch is also a somewhat canny move since the Chinese courts are known for refusing to uphold foreign trademark lawsuits.

One key element here is that Intel hasn’t attempted to trademark A380 or any other Arc GPU designation due to an entirely different legal precedent at play here that could work in Intel’s favor - and to delve into that we have to go all the way back to a hotel in Sunnyvale California in the year 1990.

What happened in Sunnyvale?

Even back in the 80s Intel and AMD were locked in a constant battle for CPU supremacy. As the decade drew to a close it looked as if Intel was winning; for years AMD had been able to produce processors that had been designed by Intel thanks to a ‘second-source’ arrangement prompted by high demand for microprocessors in new computers. But Intel had decided to end this agreement becoming the only source of its coveted 80386 chip.

AMD had been making big money but losing the ability to sell the 80386 processor was a huge blow. Intel owned the trademark on the 80386 (or just ‘386’) and that mark was closely guarded; Team Blue was wary of imitators and it was right to be. It defended the trademark and the associated technology zealously engaging in lawsuits with AMD to prevent it from continuing to utilize the microarchitecture that powered the 386.

AMD had already begun attempting to reverse-engineer its own version of the 386 chip but before it could release it a quirk of fate saw Intel commencing a fresh legal battle against its former business partner.

Late in 1990 an AMD marketing official from Texas by the name of Mike Webb visited Sunnyvale where AMD’s headquarters were located. He stayed at the Hilton unaware that an Intel engineer was staying at the same hotel - and just happened to share the name Mike Webb. When an express package was delivered to the hotel for AMD’s Mike Webb after both men had checked out the hotel unknowingly forwarded it to the wrong Mr Webb .

That package contained marketing materials for a proposed ‘AM386’ processor. Intel’s Mike Webb turned the contents over to Intel’s legal team who took one look at the AM386 branding sealed the package without reading another word and immediately filed a lawsuit against AMD for infringing the ‘386’ trademark.

A change of fate for AMD

Unfortunately for Intel the judge ruled in AMD’s favor in March 1991 determining the ‘386’ trademark to be generic rather than an upholdable identifier of the product. This set a troublesome precedent for Intel; the manufacturer was unable to secure trademarks for the planned 486 and 586 chips and AMD went on to release the AM386 and establish itself as a serious competitor to Team Blue in the CPU market.

The impact this had is seen in the names of every mainstream CPU on the market today: specifically that they actually have names rather than just numbers. Intel’s next move was to establish the Pentium brand while the numbers became a mere sub-identifier of the chip. In fact Intel was keen to reiterate the distinction between a product name and what it called an ‘alpha-numeric product designation’ when we contacted the company regarding this story.

This legal precedent extends to GPUs too hence why ‘A380’ is not an Intel trademark and will never become one; it’s just a designation while ‘Intel Arc’ is the actual registered trademark. Assuming that the 1991 ruling is upheld Airbus has no hope of a lawsuit here since Intel basically already lost that battle.

Within the technology field trademarking a short string of letters and numbers is basically impossible now so it stands to reason that Intel can safely use whatever designation it wants without fear of legal retribution. And that’s the story of how in a bizarre sequence of events Intel might’ve just managed to avoid a lawsuit by losing a different one way back in 1991.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdhcmthZHZvY2F0ZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA2LzI1L2ludGVsLW1lYW5zLWludGVyZXN0LWxpY2tpbmctY291bnR5LWJ1c2luZXNzLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtcmVzaWRlbnRzLzc3MjE3MTcwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel means interest for Licking County business government residents,"NEWARK — If Intel is the topic there will be plenty of interest. That was never more apparent than in the attendance at the local leaders panel discussion Wednesday at Moundbuilders Country Club.

The Licking County Chamber of Commerce breakfast attracted 200 a record for the the local leaders events. Attendees parked on the grass and down the street by the country club. And 25 more were on a waiting list and could not attend.

“All we have to do is add a five-letter word and we fill a room said Rick Platt president and CEO of the Heath-Newark-Licking County Port Authority

Intel plans to build two factories called fabs just south of Johnstown on Jersey Township land to be annexed into New Albany. It is the state's biggest economic development project. The factories will employ 3000 workers with an average wage of $135000.

Emily Smith the Intel director of Ohio Public Affairs said ""You read national stories saying what’s going on in Ohio. Well we’re awesome that’s what’s going on. It’s very exciting for me to say this is Intel’s first new investment in 40 years in the United States and how cool that’s its in Ohio.”

The company announced its plans at The Midland Theatre in Newark on Jan. 21 a date Platt said will go down in Licking County history.

“They picked a state that can draw from a population base in Columbus but they’ll be surprised how much comes from the east"" Platt said. ""We’re growing our manufacturing workforce which defies what some across the country are predicting.

“It’s a bugle call to parents that manufacturers do have a place. It’s something we all need to take advantage of. Instead of fighting for a piece of the pie. Let’s grow the pie.”

The May unemployment rate in Licking County tied the all-time low of 2.7% There was a record 90300 Licking Countians employed in May and the labor force was 92900 just 100 shy of the record set in March. There were 2500 unemployed.

So there will be more available jobs here than unemployed. That maybe the situation already.

“Workforce has been a major concern for a lot employers in our county for quite some time so this is not a new topic of interest"" said Alexis Fitzsimmons executive director of Grow Licking County.

FItzsimmons said Licking County Works a committee within Grow Licking County works with partners in the county to create and maintain an environment that promotes a pipeline of workers educated here and staying here to work in manufacturing healthcare IT and logistics/distribution.

“Manufacturing has a generational history in Licking County"" Fitzsimmons said. ""The breadth of diversity of manufacturing in our county is what provides a resiliency to our economy that allows us to go through some of the harder times in a better situation than some other counties do and some other areas of our country. We want to support that.”

Grow Licking County is also creating workforce videos of young people who’ve gone through its workforce development programs talking about the program and how it helped them. The videos will be shown to other youth to show they don’t have to leave Licking County to find opportunity.

Fitzsimmons said Licking County will adjust for Intel but the adjustments are not as big as some may think.

“We have very little modifying to do"" Fitzsimmons said. ""We are very well-prepared as a county to meet the demands of training and the workforce demands that Intel has. We have these things in place currently. They may take a little tweaking but we have in place currently is really a great model.”

Grow Licking County is also partnering with the Licking County Commissioners and LCATS on a 10-month water and sewer study of the 14 systems operating in Licking County to determine what investments need to be made and where.

Jennifer Roberts executive director of the Thomas J. Evans Foundation said the foundation is helping provide a public-private partnership to create a countywide visioning plan for Intel.

“Much of that work is taking place in silos"" Roberts said. ""It’s important to evaluate what we as a county want. We need to do a little bit of catchup. There’s so much activity happening we thought it was important to pull these groups together. Our goal is in 5 to 10 years we can all say we’re proud to live in Licking County.”

Intel has urged Congress to pass a $52 billion aid package called the Chips Act for the semiconductor industry saying its plans are dependent on the aid.

Ted Geer the One Columbus program manager said the Chips Act has been stalled in a Congressional conference committee with the senate passing a slimmer version.

Intel announced Thursday it has delayed the July 22 groundbreaking for the Ohio facility due to the delay in passing the Chips Act.

If the Chips Act passes the two-fab $20 billion project could become an eight fab $100 billion investment.

Though capable of gaming the Arc series is primarily optimized for content creators and encoding first and foremost. If you intend to use the Asus more so for encoding and video editing work then the Arc will make more sense. For gaming purposes a GeForce-based laptop will offer more consistent performance across titles.

According to 3DMark the Arc A370M can run 70 to 100 percent faster than the GeForce MX450 or perform similarly to the mobile GTX 1060 in DX12 applications. In actual games however the Intel GPU can sometimes be faster or slower than the GeForce MX450 depending on the title. In our tests the Arc A370M readily outperforms the MX450 in Final Fantasy XV Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 while the opposite is true on GTA V DOTA 2 Reborn or X-Plane. 3DMark is therefore a poor indicator of gaming performance if used as a comparison tool between Arc and Nvidia or Arc and AMD. Even so performance is still faster than the integrated Iris Xe 96 EUs across the board.

We recommend aiming for a steady 40 FPS in most games instead of 30 or 60 FPS with the Arc A370M as the native refresh rate of the display is 120 Hz.

As the Arc 370M is still new and running on early drivers we expect performance to improve over time as the hardware and drivers mature. Additional games will be benchmarked and added to the list over time."

Investors are questioning how much further US stocks will slide this year after a protracted sell-off that knocked Wall Street’s S&P 500 more than a fifth below its January peak.

Fears have intensified that the US central bank will tip the world’s largest economy into recession in a bid to tackle soaring inflation with higher interest rates. In turn the S&P tumbled into bear market territory in recent weeks commonly defined as a correction of 20 per cent or more from a recent high-point.

Asking whether the bottom is now in sight Société Générale examined 56 “crisis” periods for US stock market corrections over the past 150 years — pertaining to sell-offs that have fuelled drawdowns greater than 10 per cent for the S&P 500.



Identifying 30 bear markets since 1870 the French bank said that history suggests the S&P should bottom out over the next six months at about 34 per cent to 40 per cent below its peak reached at the start of 2022.

Solomon Tadesse SocGen’s head of equity quant research for North America said that further declines for US equities were likely as tighter monetary policy may lead to stagflation — a combination of persistent inflation and little or negative economic growth.

Tadesse pointed out that the current correction for the US stock market is not atypical compared with history. By contrast the speed and the scale of the rebound for Wall Street from the coronavirus-induced low in March 2020 was extraordinary.

The S&P 500 surged 113 per cent higher after bottoming out on 23 March 2020 boosted by huge injections of liquidity provided by the Fed and generous emergency public spending measures to counteract the pandemic. “The post-Covid market surge now appears highly excessive” says Tadesse. That led to an unsustainable bubble which is now deflating he added.

Investors may brace themselves for more volatility on the stock market until they are satisfied that the Fed has regained control over inflation — currently running at a 40-year high of 8.6 per cent.",,,,,,,,,

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the IFF First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.

Michael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning good afternoon and good evening everyone. Welcome to IFF’s first quarter 2024 conference call. Yesterday afternoon we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. During the call we will be making forward-looking statements about the company’s performance and outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release.

Today’s presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release that we issued yesterday. With me on the call today is our CEO Erik Fyrwald and our Executive Vice President CFO and Business Transformation Officer Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end. With that I would now like to turn the call over to Eric.

Erik Fyrwald: Well thank you Mike and hello everyone. I’m excited to join you all today to discuss our solid performance in the first quarter and what we are seeing across the business so far this year. Today we’ll focus on our financial results our outlook for the balance of the year and our increased confidence in our reiterated guidance where we now see us trending toward the upper end. Now before moving forward I want to acknowledge Glenn who today is announcing his plan to retire at the end of 2024 after three successful years with the company. During his tenure Glenn has driven multiple actions to improve our balance sheet and position the company for financial success. We’ve benefited from his experience and commitment to transformation and his ongoing leadership to position IFF to drive long term profitable market share growth.

He’s also been very helpful to me already as I’ve come on to the IFF team. Now with this announcement we have started a succession plan to evaluate internal and external candidates to succeed Glenn. The board and I are grateful for all Glenn has helped IFF accomplish and look forward to his continued leadership as we identify a successor and ensure a smooth transition. Now turning to Slide Six we are off to a good start at IFF. We achieved volume growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2022 as volumes grew mid-single digit in the first quarter of 2024 with strong contributions from scent nourish and health and biosciences. We are also encouraged by the double digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth as we not only benefited from volume growth but also from productivity gains across our businesses.

At the same time we made important progress focusing our portfolio with closing the divestiture of the cosmetics ingredients business and the announced sale of our Pharma Solutions business. We expect to complete the Pharma transaction in the first half of 2025. The proceeds from these divestitures will help further strengthen our capital structure address our deleveraging goal of three times net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA and refocus us on high growth areas of our business. With our solid performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of 2024 and now expect full year 2024 results to trend toward the high end of our previously announced guidance ranges.

It’s still early in the year and there is a lot more work to be done but we are focused on building on our momentum to energize our team and return to sustainable profitable growth. Turning to Slide Seven let me take a step back for a moment and share what I’ve learned during my first 90 days here at IFF. I’ve spent time getting to know our teams all over the world and meeting with many of our customers and I’m grateful for the productive discussions and what I’ve found is that IFF has lots of top talent and incredible innovation capabilities but we’re not yet realizing our full potential. With a new leadership perspective on our priorities and a renewed focus on execution by our executive leadership team we are getting back to basics and I’m optimistic about what we will do from here.

First we are strengthening our balance sheet and capital structure to create the flexibility we need to achieve our long term goals. My assessment is we have not consistently delivered on our financial commitments largely due to a need for more strategic and organization operating model clarity to enable us to better execute against our goals. I think we are now getting the clarity we need and have taken some decisive steps in the first quarter to help us start to realize more of our potential. We recently rightsized our quarterly dividend to align with the market and our long term cash flow generation and have made divestiture moves including cosmetics and pharma solutions to focus our portfolio and drive debt reduction. We also recently announced and are implementing our refocused IFF operating model which is now business-led supported by lean functions.

This includes the appointment Ana Paula Mendonça who has dedicated her career to the advancement of fragrance at IFF as the President of Scent. This enables Simon Herriott to focus his full attention on driving profitable growth in our health and biosciences business unit. We will also put more focus on our flavors and functional ingredients units within our nourish division. With this operating model change we have also changed the reporting structure of several of our functions including R&D operations finance and HR to go directly into our business unit presidents so they have the full end-to-end responsibility and accountability for business execution. Their goals will include delivering growth above market with a margin structure that gets us in line with or better than leading peers.

Now to make this work we have also established an operating system which is a simple set of management processes that collectively define how IFF makes decisions and creates value provides a framework for standardized processes responsibilities and metrics and defines the tools to help managers drive continuous improvement. We believe this will create greater visibility to track performance so we drive execution to deliver results in the current period in ways that strengthen us for the coming years. We are also introducing an operating philosophy based on four main pillars; number one customer focus to drive profitable market share growth; number two innovation powerhouse to create sustainable new products and other innovations customers value and do this faster; number three operational excellence to lead our relentless focus on safety quality continuous improvement and competitive cost structures and four; people people who are engaged across the organization.

We expect that our business-empowered model and operating system will enhance collaboration to profitably win with customers and by doing so deliver strong financial performance over time and while it’s still early I am pleased and encouraged by the energy and commitment of our teams all around the world. With that I’ll now pass it over to Glenn to dive deeper into our results for the first quarter. Glenn?

Glenn Richter: Thank you Eric and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Eric mentioned earlier we’re encouraged by the momentum across our business as we start the year and we are excited to continue to build on these positive early signals throughout 2024 and beyond. In the first quarter IFF generated roughly $2.9 billion in sales. On a comparable currency neutral basis. Sales increased 5% year-over-year. Our strong quarterly revenue performance was led by mid-single digit volume growth with sequential improvements across most of our businesses including scent health and biosciences and nourish. Pricing was modestly positive inclusive of FX-related pricing in emerging markets in particular the Argentine Peso where we like the industry have indexed pricing to US and or Euro exchange rates that drive pricing changes.

Absent of this benefit pricing would have been negative in the quarter largely in line with our plan. We delivered strong profitability in the quarter with adjusted operating EBITDA of $578 million. This represents a 20% increase on a comparable year-over-year basis led by volume growth and the contribution from productivity initiatives. As a result margins improved by approximately 310 basis points to nearly 20% adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Turning now to Slide Nine I’ll dive deeper into the business performance across our segments. In nourish sales increased by 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with strong double-digit growth in flavors with improvements in both volume and price and we saw very strong growth in our flavors business across nearly all markets.

Functional ingredients volume was up low single digits the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall comparable currency neutral sales declined year-over-year due to our planned pricing actions. In terms of profitability productivity gains and volume growth drove a 13% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA with solid gross margin improvements in both flavors and functional ingredients. Our health and bioscience segment had another strong quarter with both top and bottom line growth. Solid performance in our H&B portfolio led by double-digit sales growth in cultures and food enzymes animal nutrition and grain processing and mid-single digit growth in home and personal care drove a 6% increase in comparable currency neutral sales.

Improved volume and productivity gains led to a 21% increase in year-over-year comparable adjusted operating EBITDA. Scent delivered another excellent quarter including 16% growth in comparable currency neutral sales driven by double digit growth in consumer fragrance and fragrance ingredients and mid-single digit growth in fine fragrances. Segment also excelled in terms of profitability primarily led by volume growth and productivity improvements which delivered an outstanding adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 55% on a comparable basis. Lastly in pharma solutions while we saw some improvements from productivity initiatives these were offset by lower volumes driven as expected due to continued destocking trends which began late last year.

It’s worth noting that part of the destocking trend in the first quarter was market related and the other is due to Pharma Solutions initiative to reduce reliance on distributors and convert more of its core excipients business into a direct distribution model. We believe the shift to a more direct approach will enhance our customer relationships reduce supply chain complexity and provide greater access to technical resources while also improving margins. Also as mentioned we agreed to divest the Pharma Solutions business as part of our portfolio optimization efforts and are confident the business will be positioned to thrive and succeed in partnership with Roquette. Now on Slide 10 I’d like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position.

Cash flow from operations totalled $99 million this quarter while CapEx was $118 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. In the first quarter normal seasonality impacted our free cash flow results. As a reminder Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year as we make annual cash bonus payments in March. Our free cash flow position totalled negative $19 million in the quarter versus negative $48 million in the year ago period. We also paid $207 million in dividends through the end of the first quarter. Our cash and cash equivalents totalled $764 million including $32 million in assets held for sale. IFF continues to make progress in our deleveraging efforts and reduced our gross debt by almost $1 billion versus year ago for a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.4 times at quarter end.

Our trailing twelve month credit adjusted EBITDA totalled approximately $2.2 billion. Please note that the proceeds from the sale of LMC of $810 million were received in April and consequently not reflected in the quarterly results. With the announced Pharma Solutions transaction we are confident that we will achieve our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of three x following the transaction close which we expect will be completed in the first half of 2025. On Slide 11 I’d like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Based on our improved financial and operational performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year we remain cautiously optimistic about the year ahead and as Eric mentioned now expect results to trend towards the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges.

This reflects our belief that volumes will also be towards the high end of our previously announced 0% to 3% with improving trends across the majority of our portfolio. We also saw pricing increases due to FX-related pricing in emerging markets in the first quarter and therefore raised our previously announced pricing guidance to approximately 1% for the full year 2024 versus previous expectation that pricing would decline approximately 2.5%. With these foreign exchange rate changes we now expect currency will have an adverse impact of 3% to 4% versus 0% to 1% as previously expected on our sales growth which is essentially offsetting the FX pricing contribution. On the bottom line for 2024 we are now trending towards the high end of our previously announced adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.

This assumes continued improvements in volumes as well as strong productivity. While it is still early in the year volume trends are encouraging and consequently we have increased confidence in our ability to achieve our full year guidance. For the second quarter we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion driven by improved volumes with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $500 million to $525 million. I’ll now turn it back to Eric for closing remarks.

Erik Fyrwald: Thank you Glenn. Now as I shared at the top of the call my first 90 days on team IFF have been energizing as I see so much potential. We have great talent and capabilities across our global teams and our solid top and bottom line results from the first quarter show that we are building positive momentum and it’s an honor to lead IFF during this transformative time and I am encouraged by our positive start to the year and our outlook. Yet we still have a lot of work to do. As the market continues to be very competitive we are committed to bringing products and innovation that differentiate us from our peers and give customers what they need to win and in turn helps them and us drive sustainable profitable growth and with a solid start to the year I’m excited to see what we can accomplish going forward. And with that I’d like to now open it up for questions.

Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin your line is now open.

Matthew Hettwer: Thank you and good morning. This is Matthew Hettwer on for Kevin. It’s nice to see a strong start to the quarter. Eric could you give us some yeah morning. Eric could you give us some additional context and detail regarding how you’ve seen the individual businesses react to your new operating philosophy through the first 90 days?

Erik Fyrwald: Yeah thanks for the question Matthew. As you probably know I’ve been on a listening tour or a discussion tour since right after the January 11 announcement of the change. Am I joining IFF and it’s been really great to hear from our employees all around the world and our customers all around the world. And what I’ve discerned from that is that we’ve had multiple companies coming together with different operating models different philosophies and there was significant uncertainty about the organization structure and how we were going to do things. And what we’ve done is the executive leadership team has come together very nicely. I’m very proud of the team and we’ve been able to together clarify the structure and operational model that we have going forward and the four pillars that we’re focused on to drive our performance.

We’ve had town halls all around the world both live and by video. We’ve touched all our employees. We’ve spent special time with our leadership and I think we’ve gotten really clear on how we’re moving the company forward and what I love about it is I feel the engagement of our people around the world. I feel their energy growing. I think there’s great acceptance and enthusiasm for the empowered business unit model for the focus on customers. The job of all of us is to support our teams to win with customers and help us profitably grow our market share and then also drive our innovation that we’re at the core we’re an innovation company and we need to make sure that we have leading innovation that we’re bringing to our customers and it’s innovation that customers value.

And then finally that we also have healthy productivity productivity that helps us strengthen the company and invest more in growth and innovation and doing that with smart productivity things like reducing consultants reducing layers driving functional shared service centers where it makes sense using technology information technology. So my feeling is that there’s great capabilities great people in this company and the executive leadership team is coming together to try and do all we can to unleash that full potential of our people all around the world.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Nicola your line is now open.

Nicola Tang: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Firstly Eric you talked there about the changed operating model. Can you talk a little bit about portfolio and following the announcement to divest Pharma Solutions do you intend to pursue any further divestments or is that it for now. And then if I could squeeze in another one for Glenn on cash flow are you still confident in your free cash flow target of $500 million a year or $700 million on an adjusted basis? And is there potentially upside given the upward revision or the high end that you see in terms of the EBITDA guidance and could you explain what drove the increase in trade receivables in the quarter? Thanks a lot.

Erik Fyrwald: Okay I’ll start and then hand it over to Glenn. And thanks for the question Nicola or questions. So on the portfolio first of all the Pharma Solutions business will be with us for another year and we see a lot of opportunity to further strengthen the performance of Pharma Solutions over the next year and then beyond that with Roquette. But then we have the other four business units that we’re going to really focus on driving forward. Of course with Nourish both the flavors and the functional ingredients we have the scent business and we have the health and biosciences business. All our focus now is on supporting those businesses to perform well to drive profitable market share growth to drive healthy productivity to make sure that we’re bringing leading innovation and deliver the best performance we can in the second quarter full year 2024 but do it in ways that strengthen us for ’25 and beyond.

We’re also going through a strategy review process for each of the businesses and we’ll take a look at what it takes to win in each of those businesses in the coming years and what we have to do investment wise and making sure that each of the businesses has the right portfolio to win going forward. So you’ll hear more about that in the coming quarters and years but right now our focus is all on making sure we’ve got the right strategy the right capabilities in each business the right collaboration culture across businesses and are winning with customers by bringing leading innovation. Glenn?

Glenn Richter: Thanks Eric. Thanks for the question Nicola. We’re actually trending more favourable in terms of our full year outlook for free cash flow and adjusted as well. As you mentioned a combination of earnings momentum actually working capital is actually performing better than planned and we expect actually some improvement and then just some timing on taxes. We’re probably going to be closer to $600 million versus the $500 million. I would note that that also includes higher Reg-G costs related to pharma. So we gave you a $200 million number in Feb that did not include pharma for obvious reasons. The heavy lifting as Eric mentioned is the balance of this year separating systems legal entities etcetera. That’s roughly about $100 million. So on adjusted basis $900 million on a free cash flow reported basis directionally $600 million. Thanks for the question.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh your line is now open."

Guest columnist

The Navy moved my family from Panama City Panama to Panama City Florida in 1961.

The summer after finishing Gulf Coast Community College I managed to work two jobs a four-hour job as “port sampler” for the National Marine Fisheries and in the labor pool of the paper mill. Inside the mill the labor pool was known as the “Bull Gang.” The work pattern for the summer was eight hours in the mill come home and clean up and work four hours at the marinas around the county.

The summer of 1974 went by really quick and I attended the University of Florida in the fall. One worry I did not have at school was money enough was earned to cover all expenses of the next three quarters of school.

I planned to come home during the summer of ’75 and repeat work at the mill. However a poor business climate reduced hiring at the mill and I had no mill job. Found plenty of work that summer but the pay was not the mill equivalent. Before I returned to school the following year I married my high school sweetheart and we both returned to Gainesville. We made it through another school year to the summer of ’76.

The mill hired me to work that summer in the machine room where the reels of paper were made. My job was to feed paper recycled from box plants into a dry end pulper. The work was shift work eight-hour shifts. The best part of the job was having overtime to “double over.” That summer work allowed for an expanded paycheck as I got a lot of 16-hour work days.

Only two more quarters of school left on my chemical engineering degree. The next focus was deciding on a career. My wife and I visited three career opportunities: petro-chemical in Houston textile in Georgia and paper in Panama City. In March 1977 we moved back to Panama City to begin a career with International Paper.

In 1930 construction teams came to Bay County to build a paper mill on the site of a former sawmill in Millville. With the country suffering during the Great Depression one of the men looking for work moved his young family from Louisiana to help build the mill. Sam Barbay was in that construction group. After the mill started producing paper in 1931 Sam continued to work in the mill with the maintenance group. Sam retired from the mill in 1957 and my father-in-law “D” Barbay began his career at the mill.

“D” had a successful career retiring in 1987. I finished my career in July 2019 with a little more than 42 years. Toward the end of my career my job included providing presentations and tours for customers visitors and community groups.

I actually continued tours as requested after retirement. The last group I toured through the mill was Leadership Bay with the Bay County Chamber of Commerce. That group like the many groups before heard the story about the mill's history and my history and my wife’s family history. I would leave a quote with the group “everything I have in life including a wife came from the mill.”

A lot of families prospered working at the paper mill. A lot of local families had connections to the paper mill. I am saddened for the families that were at the mill when it closed that will not enjoy the full career opportunity my wife’s family had for more than 90 years.

Tem Fontaine has lived in Bay County for 61 years and his professional career at the paper mill spanned 42 years. He is now retired but remains active with the Historical Society of Bay County and the Bay County Chamber of Commerce and its Military Affairs Committee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGFpbHl0ZXhhbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9jb2xvbmlhbGlzbS1wcm9kdWNlcy1nYXBzLWluLXNjaWVudGlmaWMtdW5kZXJzdGFuZGluZy1vZi1jYXJpYmJlYW4tcmVzZWFyY2hlcnMtZmluZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colonialism produces gaps in scientific understanding of Caribbean researchers find,"The Caribbean is a region recognized for its rich biodiversity but the long-standing legacy of colonialism continues to create gaps in scientists’ understanding of the area’s natural history. This results in a lack of international and local collaboration in ecological studies of the region a recent paper by international researchers shows.

“If you think about colonial systems there was a lot of extraction of resources and development of infrastructure to get those resources out” said Melissa Kemp a senior author of the study and assistant professor of integrative biology at UT.

“There was no real investment in the communities and educating communities unless it was leading to extracting materials for your own consumption or your own wealth. I think scientists can fall into that trap as well” Kemp said.

The paper’s researchers analyzed natural history collections in Trinidad and Tobago and international biology collaborations and historical research in The Bahamas to exemplify the colonial framing of research conducted in the Caribbean. The paper highlighted a lack of collaboration between local and foreign researchers on projects done on the islands.

Researchers in the region may have the data from these projects but lack funds and publishing opportunities said Ryan Mohammed lead author and postdoctoral research fellow at Williams College.

The study also described a skewed post-colonial perspective on biodiversity within the Caribbean that falsely views the region as “pristine” and untouched by humans.

“People have been inhabiting The Bahamas for hundreds of years even prior to Columbus arriving in the new world” said Kelly Fowler senior assistant archaeologist and research officer at the National Museum of The Bahamas.

“The continental people who would have originally occupied the islands would have brought certain plants and animals with them.” Fowler said. “You can’t just assume that what you see here has always been here.”

The colonial practice of extracting resources with no benefit to the native community plays out in research done today Kemp said when resources are extracted with no intellectual investment in the local communities who assist in data collection. Where the research materials go after extraction is vital too. The vast majority of specimens from Trinidad and Tobago and other islands are housed in North American and European institutions limiting data access for local researchers.

“Even though fossils were present in Trinidad these fossils were really inaccessible to people living in Trinidad and unknown to a lot of people because they have simply been sent out to other institutions abroad” said Alexis Mychajliw senior author and assistant professor at Middlebury College.

To break the colonial framing research needs to be collaborative and accessible Mohammed said. He suggests that foreign researchers in the Caribbean engage with local communities and ministries to produce more efficient and productive findings. He also said research in the region should be published on free international databases so access is no longer restricted and extracted fossils are returned to local researchers.

“One thing the paper did not address was the issues … within Caribbean countries” Mohammed said. “Data is held close to your chest and not shared because of fear of … extorting data sets a fear of losing control of biodiverse resources et cetera. … (If it’s) not accessible for everyone then it’s the same (as) colonialism all over again where nothing will be shared but it’s just governed by someone else.”

U.S. researchers have the responsibility to communicate with local groups and take their research interests into consideration Mychajliw said.

“It has definitely challenged me to think more deeply about how I’m connecting with communities particularly at the beginning of a project and making sure that I’m engaged with not only the research questions but the communities in which these questions are being answered” Kemp said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3Njb3R0LWRyZW5ub24tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzU0MTA5NjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scott Drennon Obituary (2022) - Lebanon TN - Partlow Funeral Chapel - Lebanon,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/scott-drennon-obituary?id=35410961 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3Njb3R0LWRyZW5ub24tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzU0MTA5NjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

And while some companies are reverting to a pre-pandemic workweek 81% of executives said they are adopting a more flexible workplace according to LinkedIn's 2022 Global Talent Trends report. But getting employees back in the office hasn't been easy and companies are having to rethink the role the office plays in a post-pandemic world.

Clive Wilkinson who designed the Googleplex is one of the architects being called on by the tech sector and others to help build workplaces that accommodate the needs of hybrid workers. From open seating workstations to video-conferencing collaboration pods they are completely rethinking the workplace as a resource for employees.



""You can't insist anymore that employees come in for a five-day week"" Wilkinson said. ""They'll come in because they want the benefits that the workplace will give them.""

Gemunu Amarasinghe / AP

JPMorgan Chase the largest bank in America and two athletic apparel giants with a significant presence in the Northwest have joined a host of companies saying they will cover the cost for employees who need to travel out of state for abortions.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday officially reversed Roe v. Wade declaring that the constitutional right to abortion upheld for nearly a half century no longer exists.

Without federal protection states are now responsible for codifying their own laws surrounding abortion. Some have already passed laws banning nearly all abortions.

JP Morgan told employees in a memo that if they live in states where abortion is outlawed the company will cover the cost of travel to a state where it’s legal beginning in July.

Nike and Adidas have also issued statements saying they’ll help employees access abortion if the procedure is restricted where they live. While abortion access is still protected in Oregon the two companies also have employees in states where abortion will now be banned or severely restricted.

Nike which is headquartered near Beaverton says abortion is covered in its family planning benefits. The athletic apparel giant says it will cover travel and lodging expenses for employees who can’t access services nearby.

Portland is home to the North American headquarters of Adidas which offered an even more specific commitment to its U.S. employees in a statement released Friday.

“Our comprehensive medical plans will continue to cover reproductive resources like contraception and abortion support pregnancy fertility and other family planning and building services” Adidas said in an emailed statement. “Where availability of abortion services may not be accessible close to home our plan now covers travel and lodging expenses up to $10000 per occurrence for all U.S. employees enrolled in the plan.”

A statement from Oregon’s largest corporate employer Intel also signaled ongoing healthcare coverage for employees seeking abortions but its statement was more cautious and vague.

“Our U.S. healthcare options cover a wide range of medical treatments including abortion where permitted as part of our overall family planning benefits” the statement said. “Intel will continue to provide resources for those who need to travel for safe timely healthcare.”

After the initial statement from JP Morgan numerous companies issued statements and internal memos to employees. They include:

Disney

Paramount

Netflix

Condé Nast

Meta

Warner Bros

Comcast

Sony

Intuit

BuzzFeed

Duolingo

Dick's Sporting Goods

Patagonia

Box

These companies join a previous wave of corporations that had made similar announcements after a Supreme Court opinion leaked in early May suggesting this outcome.

Those companies include:

Amazon

Zillow

Levi Strauss

Apple

Lyft

Uber

Airbnb

DoorDash

Yelp

Citigroup

Tesla

Microsoft

Starbucks

Mastercard

Reddit

""Access to reproductive health care including abortion has been a critical factor to the workplace gains and contributions women have made over the past 50 years"" a May 4 statement from Levi's said.

Media company Condé Nast said it will pay for travel and lodging costs if employees need to travel out of their state for an abortion according to an internal memo from CEO Roger Lynch to employees of the publisher of Vogue New Yorker and Vanity Fair among others.

""It is a crushing blow to reproductive rights that have been protected for nearly half a century"" Lynch said in the memo obtained by NPR.

Condé Nast said the company has made enhancements to its U.S. health benefits to help employees and their dependents get access to reproductive care regardless of where they reside.

Lynch went further in his email to exhort his employees to use their journalism to respond in this moment.

""The most powerful way for us to respond to what's happening right now is through our brands and the distinctive editorial lenses with which they're covering today's news and the effect it will have on society"" he said. ""Our values are clear in the content and journalism we produce.""

Here's the proof,"Text messages. Mailers. Cold calls. Over the past two years homeowners have been bombarded with inquiries from investors who want to know one thing: Are they open to selling their property?

Since the onset of the Pandemic Housing Boom investors have flooded the U.S. housing market. There are small players like mom-and-pop landlords and Airbnb hosts who are adding to their property portfolios. Home flippers returned with vengeance. There’s also the Wall Street types like Blackstone and iBuyer players like Opendoor Technologies that are gobbling up homes. The combination of low mortgage rates easy access to capital and record home appreciation was all too enticing for investors to pass up on.

However even as investors piled into the housing market many real estate insiders over the past two years hesitated to attribute much if any of the boom to investors. In their view numerous factors drove the housing frenzy. Historically low mortgage rates spurred by the Federal Reserve’s response to the COVID-19 recession attracted all types of buyers. That included white-collar professionals who saw their jobs transition to remote during the pandemic and were eager to ditch apartments in places like San Francisco and Boston for homes in markets like Boise and Tampa. The pandemic also coincided with the five-year window (between 2019 and 2023) when millennials born during the generation’s five largest birth years (between 1989 and 1993) would hit the peak first-time homebuying age of 30. That elevated demand simply overwhelmed the supply side: Housing inventory which was already trending downward before the pandemic struck fell to a 40-year low during the boom.

But that hesitation to name investors as one of the pillars of the Pandemic Housing Boom is no longer necessary. It’s now abundantly clear that investors did indeed help accelerate the housing boom and drive up U.S. home prices. At least that’s what Fortune concluded after looking over recent data published by Redfin Freddie Mac and the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.

In the first quarter of 2022 investors made up a record 28% of single-family home sales according to a report published last week by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. That’s up from 19% in the first quarter of 2021. It’s also far above the 16% that investors made up of single-family home sales between 2017 and 2019. (To conduct the analysis the Harvard researchers analyzed home sale data collected by CoreLogic.)

The investor bull rush into the housing market was the most pronounced in fast-growing markets in the U.S. South and West according to the Harvard researchers. That finding is backed up by a separate Redfin analysis which looked at all home sales (unlike Harvard’s single-family homes analysis). In the first quarter of 2022 investors made up a staggering 33.1% of home sales in Atlanta. Not far behind was Jacksonville (32.3%) Charlotte (32.3%) Phoenix (29.0%) and Miami (28.2%). Those same markets are also among the nation’s most “overvalued” housing markets that are at risk of seeing a home price decline according to Moody’s Analytics.

While markets in the South and West saw the most investor activity almost every major U.S. housing market saw an uptick. Among the 31 large markets analyzed by Redfin 29 saw an uptick in investor activity. Look no further than Ohio which saw the share of investor homes sales jump in Cincinnati (up 2.9 percentage points) Cleveland (up 3.1 percentage points) and Columbus (up 7 percentage points). Between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 only Seattle (down 0.5 percentage point) and Milwaukee (down 0.1 percentage point) saw a decline in the share of home sales attributed to investors.

Researchers at Freddie Mac who did their own analysis of public records found a more modest jump in investor purchases than Harvard and Redfin researchers. Between December 2019 and December 2021 Freddie Mac found investor home purchases climbed from 26.7% to 27.6%. However Freddie Mac acknowledges its analysis isn’t fully capturing all-cash purchases by investors.

Let’s be clear: The vast majority of investor home purchases in America are still made by small or midsize investors: ranging from average Joes owning an Airbnb rental to individuals who’ve spent years amassing a hefty portfolio of rentals. According to the Harvard study 74% of investor purchases in September were made by investors with portfolios of less than 100 properties. The remaining 26% of investor purchases were made by groups with property portfolios of at least 100 units.

That said it’s clear that those big investors were among the biggest drivers of the uptick in investor purchases.

“Investors with large portfolios (at least 100 properties) drove much of this growth nearly doubling their share of investor purchases from 14% in September 2020 to 26% in September 2021” wrote the Harvard researchers. “By buying up single-family homes investors have reduced the already limited supply available to potential owner-occupants particularly first-time and moderate-income buyers.”

Who are these big investors? Some are massive rental companies like Invitation Homes—the nation's largest owner of single-family rental homes—which grew its portfolio during the pandemic. Blackstone which founded Invitation Homes back in 2012 also got back into the single-family home business during the pandemic. (In 2019 Blackstone had backed away from the business after selling its remaining shares of Invitation Homes.)

The Pandemic Housing Boom also saw a surge on the iBuying side of the market. These iBuyers—including firms like Opendoor Offerpad RedfinNow and Zillow Offers—went around the country making swift offers to home sellers. The companies would then quickly put the home back on the market. It's less of a traditional ""home flip"" and more of a volume play: On each sale iBuyers net a ""service fee"" that the firm charges the buyer in exchange for the speedy transaction.

As the housing boom took hold it saw Zillow’s earnings initially soar—with the real estate site posting a record $52 million profit in the first quarter of 2021. That fed Zillow’s iBuyer confidence as it quickly grew its home buying business to over three-fourths of its total revenues. Of course Zillow's home flipping business would go on to implode in epic fashion last fall. But only after Zillow’s much-lauded algorithm overpaid analysts tell Fortune for thousands of U.S. homes.

But most housing investors are still groups you’ve likely never heard of. The Opendoor and Blackstones of the world at least for now are still a small piece of the investor pie.

“While large corporate investors are rapidly rising as a share of the market and are likely to expand they remain so small that their market share only has a modest impact on the overall percentage of investors” wrote Freddie Mac researchers earlier this month. During the pandemic iBuyer and institutional buyers have jumped from around a 1.5% market share of purchases to around 4.5% according to Freddie Mac.

It's intellectually dishonest to pin soaring U.S. home prices—which are up 37% over the past two years—on any one company. However when you step back and examine the elevated demand that has come from the investor side of the market it's clear they've attributed at least in some degree to soaring home prices. Investors both big and small gobbled up a larger market share during the pandemic. The impact of elevated investor demand also goes beyond the homes they actually bought. Even when investors are on the losing side of a bidding war from an economic lens at least they are still putting upward pressure on prices.

As the Pandemic Housing Boom implodes amid spiked mortgage rates it raises the question: Is the investor rush into the housing market a temporary feature of the pandemic or the start of a lasting trend?

While spiked mortgage rates are pricing out many first-time buyers it's also seeing investors pull back from the market. Surging mortgage rates change the math for investors: The added costs means many investors would take on mortgage payments that are greater than they can charge for rent.

“Investor home purchases are falling for the same reason overall home purchases are falling: Surging interest rates and high housing prices have made it more expensive to get a mortgage and buy a home” wrote Sheharyar Bokhari a senior economist at Redfin in a report published this month. “While roughly three-quarters of investor purchases are made with cash investors are still impacted by interest rates because they often take out loans to get that cash.”

Brian Milner is a former senior economics writer and global markets columnist for The Globe and Mail.

Rising borrowing costs dimming economic prospects and stricter lending rules are taking some of the air out of housing bubbles in Canada the United States and other markets in which strong demand tight supply and speculative fever have driven prices to record levels and deepened an already serious affordability crisis.

The evidence that overheated markets are cooling is mounting. Canadian home resales slid 8.6 per cent in May from the previous month and much more than that in such hot markets as Vancouver. Prices fell for a second consecutive month after shooting higher through most of the COVID-19 pandemic and some economists forecast a decline of up to 20 per cent this year as higher mortgage rates hit home.

Restoring a modicum of sanity to residential markets won’t do much for people seeking accommodation they can afford. But at least it will prevent the crisis from getting even worse right? Well not really.

Institutional investors which have squeezed residential markets in many parts of the world can be expected to pick up a purchasing pace that has turned them into the world’s biggest private landlords and transformed rental housing into a go-to global asset class.

“Institutional ownership threatens to accelerate the trends unleashed by the financialization of housing” says a report commissioned by the Greens group in the European Parliament to buttress their case for a regional response to the crisis. “Deeper financial markets have not substantively increased either aggregate home ownership or housing supply but instead have inflated house prices and pulled down rental yields.”

In Canada the big institutional money has largely stuck with apartment buildings in major cities. But across the U.S. Britain and elsewhere in Europe private equity firms Wall Street investment banks sovereign wealth funds insurers major pension funds (including the investment arm of the Canada Pension Plan) and their real estate partners and affiliates have been loading up on single-family homes.

The institutional crowd used to steer clear of this fragmented market that typically attracted small-scale mom-and-pop investors. But automated digital platforms have made it easier and cheaper to track price acquire and manage large swaths of homes in multiple communities. As they snap up properties these bulk-buying acquisitors have helped drive up sales prices and rental costs skewed development and in some cases exacerbated housing insecurity.

Defending a federal budget measure that calls for a two-year ban on home purchases by foreigners Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared that houses “aren’t supposed to be assets for wealthy investors. They are supposed to be homes where families can raise their kids and create neighbourhoods and communities.”

It’s a fine sentiment. But the fact is that investors will keep knocking on Canadian doors. Foreign capital can easily team up with Canadian partners and domestic investors routinely outbid house-hunting families. The attraction? The prospect of steady returns long-term price appreciation and inflation protection – rent hikes far outstrip cost of living increases – at a time when rising volatility soaring public debt and heightened geopolitical risk are clouding the outlook for stocks bonds and other investments.

The financial heavyweights’ move into housing has been aided and abetted by governments through financial deregulation tax breaks subsidies for home owners historically low borrowing costs and relief for renters which translates into stable income for investors.

Years of loose monetary policy “contributed to making government bonds less and less attractive and housing finance more and more accessible shifting investments into the real estate markets and creating house price bubbles which increased housing unaffordability” says Sebastian Kohl a sociology professor at Berlin’s Free University and co-author of the European report titled My Home is an Asset Class.

“On one hand we say housing is a human right. But we see more and more resources allocated to supporting home ownership and private rental” says Yushu Zhu an assistant professor of urban studies and public policy at Simon Fraser University who has researched housing inequality and the impact of turning the sector into “an investment opportunity.”

The crisis has triggered a growing public backlash to the power of the investors as angry residents demand government action ranging from rent controls and stiffer sanctions to more drastic intervention.

In Berlin institutional investors have gobbled up €40-billion (about $54.8-billion) worth of rental homes double the combined value of what they own in London and Amsterdam their next largest European markets. A majority of Berliners voted in a referendum last September to expropriate holdings of landlords with 3000 or more apartments. A commission is currently investigating whether such a law would be constitutional.

People are fighting the investment tide in other markets too with varying degrees of success. In the Netherlands the government has given municipal authorities the right to block companies from buying homes in lower-income districts and turning them into rentals. This comes after more than one-third of the properties sold in the country’s four largest cities in 2020 ended up in the hands of investors.

In the U.S. some communities have adopted rules to make corporate or investor purchases of single-family houses less attractive. A homeowners’ association in Charlotte N.C. passed an ordinance in 2019 forcing buyers to wait two years before renting out their houses. Others have imposed similar impediments which have occasionally slowed but not halted the investor-led shopping spree.

The largest and most experienced institutional player in the residential game is Blackstone Group a global investing powerhouse with US$550-billion worth of property holdings running the gamut from office buildings hotels housing and retail complexes to industrial space warehouses data centres and research facilities.

Blackstone last month opened its first real estate office in Toronto to expand its already substantial presence in this country where it holds $14-billion worth of property mainly in the logistics sector but also commercial and residential buildings in Montreal Toronto and Vancouver.

The asset manager has spent billions acquiring housing in the U.S. and other markets from Britain to China. Responding to criticism of its aggressive expansion Blackstone points out that its funds own less than 1 per cent of rental housing in the U.S. and other markets where it operates. In a company statement it said “Given our ownership levels we have virtually no ability to impact market rent trends. Rents are going up because there is significantly less supply of housing across the globe than demand for it.”

It’s true that Blackstone Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Tricon Residential Inc. and the rest of the institutional buyers club combined account for no more than about 2 per cent of rental stock in any country. But that amounts to about 300000 single-family houses in the U.S. alone largely concentrated in certain districts of fast-growing cities and surrounding suburbs many of them in the lightly regulated sunbelt states.

Institutional investors’ “domination of some local housing markets gives them the power to increase rents and dictate lease terms” Suzanne Lanyi Charles an associate professor of urban planning at Cornell University wrote last month in The Hill a Washington political website. She noted that “where their rentals are highly concentrated mega-landlords have outsized power over the lives of residents. They can undermine renters’ access to those neighbourhoods as well as housing affordability and stability.”

The biggest American operator Invitation Homes Inc. a publicly traded company worth about US$23-billion created by Blackstone jacked up rents last year by 18 per cent for new leases 8 per cent for renewals and almost 30 per cent in such booming U.S. markets as Las Vegas she said.

Blackstone began crafting its single-family investment strategy in the U.S. a decade ago when the market was still reeling from the 2008 financial meltdown and ensuing Great Recession. In the immediate aftermath of the housing collapse Blackstone and other specialists in distressed assets loaded up on cheap foreclosed properties and later flipped them for quick profits.

But Blackstone and a handful of other players subsequently adopted a model in which large-scale holdings would be converted to rentals producing a steady stream of income. Persistent housing shortages – nearly 30 U.S. states report deficits – ensured that demand would support higher rents even in a flagging economy.

The single-family rental game has since grown so profitable that developers want to play too. Imagine a house-seeking family trying to compete with the likes of Core Development Group a Toronto-based condo builder that unveiled plans last year to spend as much as $1-billion acquiring detached homes in various mid-sized cities.

In the U.S. home builder Lennar Corp. teamed up last year with the real estate subsidiary of German insurer Allianz and other institutional investors in a venture to buy more than US$4-billion worth of new houses and hang “for lease” signs on them. Another developer put its entire 124-house subdivision in a Houston suburb on the rental market and then sold it all last year to Fundrise an online property investment platform that manages in excess of US$1-billion for more than 260000 small investors.

None of these investments will do anything to address the acute lack of affordable housing. And neither will some of the enacted or proposed restrictions aimed at reining in the money crowd including foreign ownership bans steeper property taxes rent caps limits on evictions or even full disclosure of who owns what.

Interventions in the marketplace need to do more than improve conditions for home buyers and renters. They have to persuade the major financial players that it’s in their interests to earmark a chunk of their investors’ capital for the construction of more affordable housing – as a few funds are doing profitably.

“The idea is not to keep institutional investors and their huge savings glut from entering the housing sector but to regulate it properly” Prof. Kohl of Free University says.

At the same time policy makers dealing not only with the current crisis but challenges posed by reurbanization and the effects of climate change ought to consider dusting off some of the successful instruments developed in the aftermath of two world wars. These created “a veritable housing production machine under state orchestration that overcame the pent-up demand and … housing shortages within about two decades” Prof. Kohl says.

One way to get that machine in gear would be for governments to put non-profit housing providers on a stronger competitive footing with private developers. It would also be “a more strategic long-term way to deter this financialization” Ms. Zhu of Simon Fraser argues.

In Europe non-profit housing accounts for as much as 20 per cent of the supply in certain markets and in some cases even more. In Vienna a social-housing pioneer a majority of renters live in municipally owned residences or subsidized non-profit co-operatives.

In Canada social housing accounts for just 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the entire rental market Ms. Zhu says. “Social housing providers are totally siloed. They cannot compete with the private market developers and they receive only very limited support from government.”

That situation isn’t going to change any time soon at least not as long as housing remains too lucrative an asset for institutional investors to ignore.

(WLUC) - Attendees at Bark River International Raceway experienced a different type of race on Sunday.

While they may look like normal RC cars you played with as kids these are far from it.

“You can’t go wrong in this hobby because all the people that we race with are great people always willing to help you” RC Racer John Wheeler said.

The U.P. Triple Crown RC series hosts races at two other tracks Big Rock RC and Iron Mountain RC.

The Bark River International Speedway course was built by the Bark River Lions Club.

“They pretty much built the track and got the container and brought the dirt in and all of the equipment. To have an organization like that backing you it’s crucial” Grow Max & Iron Mountain RC Owner Dave Fraser said.

The cars can cost anywhere from $100 to $1000 and take around 10 hours to build if you do it yourself.

The sport features racers of all ages.

“We have a lot of families that come and it’s really great to get kids into it because they learn a lot of stuff” Fraser said. “A little kid starts and before you know it they know how to solder gear race shows and work on shocks. It’s just like a mini version of a real car.”

Nine-year-old youth racer Terry Bovard says he’s happy to be involved in the sport.

“It’s a fun sport and you get to have whatever kind of RC that you want unless it has an extremely powerful motor. You just have a fun time” Bovard said.

Wheeler urges everyone to give it a try.

“If you got a chance come out and watch if not come out and borrow a truck I’ll let you run one of mine get hooked on it and you’ll be good to go” Wheeler said.

The races are open to members of all ages all you need is a working RC car. If you are looking to see where they are racing next visit the Big Rock RC Iron Mountain RC and Bark River Lions RC websites.

Most recently her “Peace Love Lilacs” painting was chosen as the poster art for the 2022 Lilac Festival on Mackinac Island. This is the fifth time her artwork was chosen for the festival held earlier this month. She also won the poster contest in 2016 2015 2013 and 2010.

“I was so honored” the artist said. “I was in shock when they unveiled it. I started to cry.”

Skiba has studios in Alpena Mackinac Island Grand Rapids and the Florida Keys.

She said she put 300 hours of work into the piece which took her about two months to complete.

“I worked really hard on this piece” Skiba said. “It’s a beautiful painting.”

She said she enjoys painting but it’s not always easy.

“It’s challenging to survive as an artist and to paint and make a living” Skiba said.

She’s doing a good job of it though as she won Best of Show and first place in painting this year in the Key West Schooners Wharf Show for the third time as well as earning many other recent honors. She made the cover of Cloverland Connections magazine. She is the featured artist at the 2022 Walloon Lake Art Show. She will be showing art at Art Prize in Grand Rapids this year as well. She also has painted live at Churchill Downs for the Kentucky Derby.

Painting since she was a young child Skiba has followed her passion using her hands and brushes with a plethora of colors. She knew she wanted to be an artist from a very young age.

“When I was a Girl Scout at age 5 I decided I wanted this to happen and it’s happening” Skiba said. “It’s just been a miraculous journey.”

She is the daughter of Joy Anne Skiba of Alpena and the late Thomas Lee Skiba. She is a fourth generation artist.

This past year she has been traveling across the country doing shows and events along the way. She also has been painting for personal and public events including weddings and graduations. She did a cross country family pilgrimage to California to honor her late nephew Brandon Skiba son of Thomas John Skiba.

She painted a beautiful piece in memory of her nephew called “Brandon Skiba On Angels Wings” which features a man on a motorcycle with majestic colorful wings and a horizon bursting with heavenly hues.

Skiba traveled to California with her life partner Thomas Lee Kingman her son Paul William Skiba Van Ess his girlfriend Jessica Martelli.

“While traveling the world is her studio” a bio from the artist reads. “Feeling blessed while loving her journey Noel continues to stand on the streets in the water or on a mountain to capture the spirit of the moment in bright expressive line quality in thick impasto vivid hues.”

On the trip she painted at many stops capturing the sites all the way from the Michigan shoreline through Yellowstone National Park Bryce Canyon Crazy Horse Mount Zion Mount Rushmore Iron Mountain and more.

She has had the honor of painting during President Gerald R. Ford’s funeral. Her paintings are in the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum the National Archives and the Michigan House of Representatives. ”

Leonardo A. Fernandez the chair and chief operating officer of the Mount Zynai Industrial Park (MZIP) said the project estimated to cost US$1 billion (roughly P50 billion) and which broke ground on June 18 had already acquired a 14.8-hectare property in Barangay Sta. Cruz here to start its first phase which would involve land preparation.

Fernandez said they chose Diplahan town of Zamboanga Sibugay as seat of the project because of its proximity to the sources of iron ore and coal being mined in Zamboanga Sibugay and nearby Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga del Norte.

“MZIP is a one billion US dollar worth project that hopefully would spike up the country’s economy” said Fernandez a former councilor of Asuncion town of Davao del Norte who also served as the executive director of the Partido Pilipino sa Pagbabago (PPP) made up of groups who campaigned for President Duterte in 2016 and one of those who egged Davao City Mayor now Vice President-elect Sara Duterte for president.

Of the project’s 100 hectare area 50 hectares will be allotted for the steel mill and smelting plant while the remaining 50 hectares will serve as an industrial park to entice local and foreign investors in the steel industry to locate.

Fernandez said the smelting plant would greatly reduce the cost of construction in the country as MZMC’s selling price would be lower than prevailing prices in the market since the company would have access to iron ores its raw materials; and would operate its own steel mill and plant to process these ores into steel bars.

He said the company had acquired in February this year the Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) of the Czarstone Mining Corp a Filipino-owned mining firm for an area covering 2637 hectares in Midsalip Zamboanga del Sur and Siayan Zamboanga del Norte for iron ore mining.

He said MZMC would not need to sell the ore to foreign markets like China nor would it import raw materials for steel processing.

“We are producing and processing our raw materials into steel products” Fernandez said. “So you will have the cheapest steel in the Philippines. You can now compete with China we can compete Asian countries. This is the start of the dawn of our industrialization” Fernandez said.

The steel mill and smelting plant has targeted to produce 1.5 metric tons of steel per year and to generate up to 20000 jobs. It would eventually create about 1000 downstream industries and 1000 factories Fernandez added.

MZMC will start site development next month and targets to start operation in three to four years.

“We will build the first steel mill and smelting plant with a target volume of 1.5 million steel production per year” Fernandez said. “Our smelting plant owns the resources so we don’t have to beg for supplies” he added.

Fernandez said MZMC had already signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) in May with the Pigsalabukan Gokom de Bayog or the Subanen tribe for the use of 15000 hectares of their property for iron ore exploration extraction and processing. A thousand hectares owned by the Subanens under CADT will be reserved for agroforestry agriculture production and other community development projects in the town of Bayog in Zamboanga del Sur.

Up to 2000 Lumads will be relocated to pave the way for the project Fernandez said.

He said the Sangguniang Bayan of Diplahan passed a resolution of no objection to the project.

Timuay Lucenio Manda the Subanen tribal leader said the Subanens were thankful that MZMC would give the tribe a 5 percent royalty way above the 1 percent mandated by law. “At first we were doubtful about MZMC but as our discussions continued we saw the sincerity of the company” Manda said in vernacular.

MZMC has also entered into a joint venture with Chinese company Shenzhou Investor Corporation for the exploration financing and marketing of the steel bars.

“Instead of exporting ore we will process them here. This will generate jobs for local people while local governments will earn from taxes” said Shenzhou Chair Ninchy Lin.

He said 100 per cent of the steel to be produced by the smelting plant would be marketed in the Philippines. “Currently the Philippines is importing (steel) from other countries due to lack of supply. We hope that once the smelting plant starts we can supply the entire country” Lin said.

During court proceedings Station Prosecution Officer lnspector Amos Mwase told the court that villagers on January 11 2022 mobilised themselves and invaded Chipunga Estate claiming that the land belongs to their forefathers.

The villagers chased away estate workers who reported for duties demolished a fence and burnt down a bridge which was constructed by the said estate.

As if that was not enough the irate villagers went ahead and cut down Mtangatanga and Bluegum trees on a five acre land all property worth millions of kwacha.

Prosecutor Mwase added that when police rushed to the scene for intervention the villagers smashed windscreens of two police motor vehicles.

The three were arrested two weeks later and in court they pleaded not guilty prompting the state to parade seven witnesses who testified against them.

In mitigation all the convicts pleaded for court’s leniency stating that they are breadwinners and that their families would suffer if sent to prison.

In submission prosecutor Mwase asked for a stiff penalty observing that the convicts planned to commit the offence as they walked from their respective homes to the estate. He added that they should have thought of consequences before their actions.

Mwase further said the estate invested a lot of money to construct the bridge and grow the trees saying this therefore required a sentence proportional and befitting the crime.

Passing the judgement Senior Resident Magistrate Rodrick Michongwe concurred with the state hence sentenced each of the convicts to 2-years imprisonment with hard labour to serve as a lesson to other would be offenders.

All convicts hail from Traditional Authority Bwananyambi in Mangochi.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Wade Ruling,"Glenn Jacobs who spent more than two decades in WWE’s ring as the sadistic disfigured wrestler Kane has taken punishing hits from wrestling fans after he enthusiastically endorsed the Supreme Court ruling Friday overturning Roe v. Wade.

Jacobs a Republican who is currently the mayor of Knox County Tenn. rejoiced in a tweet about the court’s historic decision eliminating federal protections for abortion rights.

“Roe v. Wade has been overturned!” Jacobs wrote in the post. “This clears the way for states like TN to pass stronger protections for the unborn and is an answer to a prayer for so many. #RightToLife #Victory.”

Jacobs’ praise about the demise of Roe v. Wade elicited dismay and sharp rebukes on social media.

“Respectfully @WWE please never have Kane return to TV again. It’s a real shame you chose to be a monster inside and outside the ring” tweeted SUPERZOMGBBQ a U.K. wrestling fan and digital content creator.

Some commenters called out Jacobs for hypocrisy. In January Jacobs had tweeted this: “Your health decisions should be between you and your doctor – not mandated down from a bureaucrat in Washington.”

Popular on Variety

Responding to his tweet Friday a user with the handle “Gabbie the dimensional spacecat” pointed out “This runs completely opposite to that reasoning you gave when you explained why you considered yourself a Libertarian. ‘I just want government to leave me alone.’ But I’m sure you know that. I’m sure you don’t care either.”

Kane was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame last year. WWE’s official bio of him reads “At 7 feet tall and weighing in at more than 300 pounds Kane is a monstrous abomination that seems to have been extracted directly from your childhood nightmares.”

Read more reactions to Jacobs’ cheering the rollback of reproductive rights in the U.S.:

The vote to kill the effort was an overwhelming 359 to 43 with seven voting “present.” Democrats flocked to Mr. Johnson’s rescue with all but 39 of them voting with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.

Members of the minority party in the House have never propped up the other party’s speaker and when the last Republican to hold the post Kevin McCarthy faced a removal vote last fall Democrats voted en masse to allow the motion to move forward and then to jettison him helping lead to his historic ouster.

This time the Democratic support made the critical difference allowing Mr. Johnson who has a minuscule majority to avoid a removal vote altogether. While for weeks Ms. Greene had appeared to be on a political island in her drive to get rid of yet another G.O.P. speaker 11 Republicans ultimately voted to allow her motion to move forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3NwZWFrZXItam9obnNvbi1vdXN0LW1vdGlvbi10by12YWNhdGUtbWFyam9yaWUtdGF5bG9yLWdyZWVuZS00ODJkYTExM2Y1NDJiNjJlZTAwYjVmMTY5MmY1OGE1YtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,House quickly rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.

One of Donald Trump’s biggest supporters in Congress Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of “transgressions” she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.

Greene criticized Johnson’s leadership as “pathetic weak and unacceptable.”

After Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.

An overwhelming majority 359-43 kept Johnson in his job for now.

“As I’ve said from the beginning and I’ve made clear here every day I intend to do my job” Johnson said afterward. “And I’ll let the chips fall where they may. In my view that is leadership.”

It’s the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.

The tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson’s hold on the gavel and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP in the Trump era. Without Democratic help Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.

All told 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene’s effort more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers — any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.

Johnson said he hoped it “is the end of the personality politics.”

As Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels including Trump GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.

The Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package for Ukraine which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.

But in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.

Johnson of Louisiana marched on saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the “right side of history.”

In a highly unusual move the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York whose leadership team had said it was time to “turn the page” on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene’s resolution — almost ensuring Johnson’s job is saved for now.

“Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems” Jeffries said after the vote.

Trump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump’s hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.

Ahead of House voting Trump said on social media “I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene” but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene’s motion.

“At some point we may very well be but this is not the time” Trump said to oust the speaker.

The move now poses its own political risks for Greene a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.

Greene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote – putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.

“I’m proud of what I did today” Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.

While reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie R-Ky. a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.

Rep. Dusty Johnson R-S.D. said of those trying to remove the speaker “They’re pretty good at getting attention but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.”

He said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker “I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.”

Reps. Carlos Giménez a Florida Republican said of Greene: “She doesn’t represent the Republican Party. I’m tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That’s all she wants is the attention.”

Rep. Mike Lawler R-N.Y. called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.

Had Democrats not taken the unusual move to help the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times with no votes to spare.

Last year the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker’s office and Democrats declined to help save him.

Ousting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.

Koza 34 passed away June 16 2022. Kris was born March 8 1988 in St. Paul MN. Kris loved being a father. Him and his son Liam enjoyed many things together like playing video games watching movies going to the park and hanging with friends. Kris had many dad jokes at the tip of his tongue and enjoyed goofing around. He co-parented well with his son's mother and they enjoyed many activities as a family. His music fishing cars and motorcycles were also important to him which he liked telling Liam about. His most favorite thing to do was spend time with Liam and snuggle his little boy. Kristopher or as his friends called him ""Koza"" was one of a kind he enjoyed sitting in his garage listening to music and working on motorcycles into the early morning hours. One thing about Kris is that he seemed to know a little about everything and was not shy about sharing his knowledge. He was always ready and willing to help any of his friends when they were in need and would show up to their house with snacks a few beers and that very distinct laugh as well as randomly cutting grass for his friends at 10 o'clock at night. When Kris would be on his way home from a night motorcycle ride we would let his friends know he was safe by driving by their house and revving his engine loud and proud. Kris made an impact in so many ways with his friends and will forever be remembered as that loving guy we all came to know and love. Kris worked at Johnson Controls as a Fire Suppression Equipment Inspector/Installer since 2018. He enjoyed working with his hands which meant he usually knew how to fix anything. He was always offering his help to those around him who needed it. He was a hard worker and showed those values always. Kris is survived by his son Liam Koza Liam’s mother Kayla Meyers Mother Edith Michalski (Piper) Father Gerald (Wink) Koza Sister Elizabeth (Koza) Tiberg and half sister Rachel (Koza) Silva. Visitation will be held on Saturday June 25 2022 at Valley Funeral Home; 2211 N. Richmond. St Appleton from 11am-2pm with a service to follow. He will be missed by family and friends and his son will forever have him in his heart.

The Denver Broncos could prove Lucky No. 14 for the 2008 fifth-round pick.

Signed in March Johnson — the oldest player on Denver's roster — appears entrenched as Russell Wilson's backup quarterback in 2022.

“It’s not too big for him and he’s been around for so long that you know he’s not going to need as many reps"" head coach Nathaniel Hackett said June 13. ""When you’re developing young guys at that position you’re always striving to get them more reps. The good thing about Josh is that he’s done so much and been in so many systems he understands it. You can throw him out there and he’s going to do a fine job.”

Johnson's resume is an interesting read from his 37 career games played nine starts and only one victory which came in Washington during the 2018 season. All told he's completed 205 of 353 attempts (58.1%) for 2270 yards 13 touchdowns and 16 interceptions — a cumulative 70.7 passer rating.

Johnson began his 2021 campaign with the New York Jets and ended it with the Baltimore Ravens. The 6-foot-3 219-pound signal-caller made four total appearances throwing for 638 yards five TDs and two INTs.

The Ravens opted not to retain Johnson who lasted days on the unrestricted free-agent market before the Wilson-led Broncos came calling. And that was that.

“The right opportunity was the opportunity to come and compete for the No. 2 spot"" Johnson said on March 21. ""It’s something I’ve been working to put myself in position to do with limited opportunity. Just the conversation I had with Mr. [General Manager George] Paton and Coach Hackett I felt like they recognized my skillset and what I can bring as a potential backup quarterback for this team in support of Russell Wilson. All those things played a factor into it. I think it’s a great fit for me. I’m excited for this point in my career. I still have a lot of football left in me. I’m excited to be here and help this team get to where it’s trying to get to.”

Denver seems to have had a plan for Johnson from the outset. They plucked him from a vast pool of available clipboard-holders then bypassed the position entirely in April's NFL draft. Standing between Johnson and a firm spot on the club's 53-man roster is former undrafted reserve Brett Rypien to whom the coaching staff and front office bear no allegiance.

The competition for No. 2 duties isn't much of a competition. It's likely Johnson's job to lose a destiny he controls.

A familiar refrain to be sure.

“For me it’s always been about control what I can control"" Johnson emphasized amid his introductory press conference. ""Walking in the building and being the same guy every day—being focused being disciplined being detailed to the craft and just going out on the field and letting my God-given talents speak for themselves. The beauty of a quarterback competition is there is only one guy under center at once. It’s multiple guys in the room but there’s only one guy who actually goes under center. That to me is what I worry about the most because that’s what I can control. I’m excited to get here and have a healthy competition with these guys because we’re still teammates first. Being together is what’s going to drive this team. I’m excited to get here with a healthy competition and letting the best man win.”

Gemunu Amarasinghe / AP

JPMorgan Chase the largest bank in America and two athletic apparel giants with a significant presence in the Northwest have joined a host of companies saying they will cover the cost for employees who need to travel out of state for abortions.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday officially reversed Roe v. Wade declaring that the constitutional right to abortion upheld for nearly a half century no longer exists.

Without federal protection states are now responsible for codifying their own laws surrounding abortion. Some have already passed laws banning nearly all abortions.

JP Morgan told employees in a memo that if they live in states where abortion is outlawed the company will cover the cost of travel to a state where it’s legal beginning in July.

Nike and Adidas have also issued statements saying they’ll help employees access abortion if the procedure is restricted where they live. While abortion access is still protected in Oregon the two companies also have employees in states where abortion will now be banned or severely restricted.

Nike which is headquartered near Beaverton says abortion is covered in its family planning benefits. The athletic apparel giant says it will cover travel and lodging expenses for employees who can’t access services nearby.

Portland is home to the North American headquarters of Adidas which offered an even more specific commitment to its U.S. employees in a statement released Friday.

“Our comprehensive medical plans will continue to cover reproductive resources like contraception and abortion support pregnancy fertility and other family planning and building services” Adidas said in an emailed statement. “Where availability of abortion services may not be accessible close to home our plan now covers travel and lodging expenses up to $10000 per occurrence for all U.S. employees enrolled in the plan.”

A statement from Oregon’s largest corporate employer Intel also signaled ongoing healthcare coverage for employees seeking abortions but its statement was more cautious and vague.

“Our U.S. healthcare options cover a wide range of medical treatments including abortion where permitted as part of our overall family planning benefits” the statement said. “Intel will continue to provide resources for those who need to travel for safe timely healthcare.”

After the initial statement from JP Morgan numerous companies issued statements and internal memos to employees. They include:

""Access to reproductive health care including abortion has been a critical factor to the workplace gains and contributions women have made over the past 50 years"" a May 4 statement from Levi's said.

Media company Condé Nast said it will pay for travel and lodging costs if employees need to travel out of their state for an abortion according to an internal memo from CEO Roger Lynch to employees of the publisher of Vogue New Yorker and Vanity Fair among others.

""It is a crushing blow to reproductive rights that have been protected for nearly half a century"" Lynch said in the memo obtained by NPR.

Condé Nast said the company has made enhancements to its U.S. health benefits to help employees and their dependents get access to reproductive care regardless of where they reside.

Lynch went further in his email to exhort his employees to use their journalism to respond in this moment.

""The most powerful way for us to respond to what's happening right now is through our brands and the distinctive editorial lenses with which they're covering today's news and the effect it will have on society"" he said. ""Our values are clear in the content and journalism we produce.""

Wade which guaranteed the federal right to abortion. With this reversal abortion laws are now left it up to individual states to determine whether their residents have the ability to safely terminate their pregnancy and whether providers can perform the procedure without fear of legal persecution.

Prior to the ruling a handful of Republican-led states already began to chip away at reproductive rights through legislation like Oklahoma's near-total abortion ban and Texas' six-week ban the latter of which criminalizes getting an abortion before most people know they're pregnant. According to ABC News though today's decision has now made abortion immediately illegal in four states thanks to trigger laws anticipating this ruling. The Guttmacher Institute has also noted that 26 states are expected to place strict restrictions on or completely ban abortions in the near future including several ones that also have trigger laws that make abortion illegal within the next 30 days.

However the past has proven that criminalizing abortion will never stop people from undergoing the procedure. The only thing it does is make the process extremely unsafe and will increase maternal deaths all while disproportionally affecting low-income and people of color. So with many people wondering what to do now we've assembled a guide on how to get an abortion and protect this aspect of your bodily autonomy. See what options are available to you below.

Figure Out Which States Protect Abortion The first step is to figure out whether your state has a trigger law in place using this state-by-state guide assembled by ABC News. As of now Arkansas Kentucky Louisiana and South Dakota have already banned abortion while more than 20 other states are likely to follow suit within the next 30 days or sooner if their law only requires approval from the state governor attorney general or legislature.

On the other hand 16 states and the District of Columbia still allow abortion. These states include California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Illinois Maine Maryland Massachusetts Nevada New Jersey New York Oregon Rhode Island Vermont and Washington. California Oregon and Washington have also formed a pact to protect abortion access and ensure people from other states can obtain the procedure with California also set to refuse any cooperation with other states trying to investigate and/or extradite residents for abortion-related prosecution.

Use This Abortion Finder If your state is anti-abortion you can still travel to DC or one of the aforementioned 16 states where is it legal at least for now. Resources like Abortion Finder I Need an A and the National Abortion Federation can help you figure out where your nearest provider is depending on age and stage of pregnancy.

In terms of covering travel costs you can check out the National Network of Abortion Funds to find a local chapter that can lend financial support whether that be for airfare gas lodging or childcare. Organizations like the Apiary Collective and the Brigid Alliance can also help you with practical support such as coordinating and paying for these expenses.

Check If Your Employer Has an Abortion Policy or Fund After leaked documents indicated the Supreme Court would overturn Roe some companies altered their health care policies to include financial support for employees seeking abortions whether it be reimbursements for travel expenses or paid time off. Amongst these companies are Starbucks Yelp Airbnb Netflix JPMorgan Chase Gucci Amazon and Microsoft though you should also check to see if your employer does the same.

Research Access to At-Home Abortion Pills If traveling out-of-state isn't an option you may still be able to get a medical abortion or a self-managed abortion which entails taking a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol in pill form. While the pills do take several days to work they're also less costly and proven to be very safe especially if you're terminating early on.

According to the MIT Technology Review you can start at a website called Plan C which outlines how to access these pills and what other options you have if your state has banned abortion including potential telehealth treatment. There's also an Austrian nonprofit called Aid Access that gets overseas doctors to prescribe the pills which are then mailed to you. This option is even available if your state has outlawed abortion as foreign doctors are not subject to state law. Just don't cross state lines with them.

Additionally it's also worth noting that there are related resources for those who choose to take this route including organizations like the Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline which can answer any medical questions you may have related to an at-home abortion.

(WSMV/Gray News) - Police are investigating a man who allegedly was using a cashback scheme at multiple grocery stores.

The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department reports that 24-year-old Austin Chase Hooper was arrested for committing fraud at self-checkout kiosks at Kroger supermarkets.

According to an arrest affidavit Hooper would purchase a small item using the cashback option with a card at self-checkouts at Kroger stores as reported by WSMV.

Before the money could dispense Hooper allegedly placed a bag over the cash dispenser and concealed the funds the kiosk provided.

Authorities said he would quickly pocket the cash call a Kroger attendant and tell the worker that the machine did not dispense any money.

On Aug. 22 2021 Steve Woodwall with Kroger Loss Prevention reportedly spotted Hooper’s connection with these incidents and banned him from all Kroger locations.

The 24-year-old was later indicted for theft and burglary according to authorities.

The affidavit stated that 21 incidents involved Hooper attempting his cashback scheme at Kroger stores in the area.

The video which has been viewed nearly 10 million times so far on TikTok struck a nerve. While Mr. Alexander later said in an interview that it was a stunt — an Instagram follower lent him the horse and his household still drives — the sight of him in stirrups staring defiantly off into the distance captured a once-in-a-generation moment of angst. Gas prices are at record highs. Even when adjusting for inflation they are on average at levels rarely seen in the last half century.

Enrollment growth is critical to maintaining Bowling Green State University’s financial health Chief Financial Officer Sheri Stoll told the Board of Trustees Thursday morning.

A couple hours later the trustees attended a ribbon cutting for a new addition to the Bowling Green Flight Center which services one of the university’s most in demand programs.

The aviation program will enroll 136 new students in fall said Cecilia Castellano. That’s in keeping with the growing interest in the program.

Ribbon cutting for $5 million addition to the BG Flight Center.

The Flight Center is operated by Minnesota-based North Star Companies. It provides all the flight training for students. The academic courses are offered through the College of Technology Architecture and Applied Engineering.

The opening of the $5 million addition which includes top of the line flight simulators was celebrated with a ribbon-cutting on Thursday. The L3 Harris’ CRJ 900 jet simulator is the same technology used by the airlines.

The center is also increasing its fleet of Seminole and Piper Archer planes.

Dean Jennie Gallimore said the center is crucial to training “the highest quality” airline pilots corporate pilots airport managers airfield specialists and aviation consultants.

Jennie Gallimore dean of the BGSU College of Technology Architecture and Applied Engineering talks with Patrick Pauken secretary of the BGSU Board of Trustees.

Since contracting with BGSU in 2014 the company has fulfilled what it promised in its initial proposal President Rodney Rogers said.

In its proposal then-owner Mark Smith promised BGSU to help build a preeminent aviation program. “Clearly that has been achieved” Rogers said.

This helps fills a critical need both in the United States and globally for pilots.

About half BGSU’s aviation students come from out of state and many from other abroad he noted.

BGSU is one of the few universities with the airport on campus.

That’s important to recent aviation graduate Audrey Rice and an important reason she decided to attend BGSU. “Having the airport so close to campus made such a huge difference.”

The flight center is 15 minutes from any building on campus and that’s important given all the planning and preparation that goes into flying.

The new addition and technology will enhance that experience. “With brand new technology this will make the transition to flying aircraft that much easier” Rice said. “I’m beyond excited by the new opportunities the new building will offer to our students and staff.”

Rice is now working on certification to become a flight instructor.

Jerry Redman left Vice President of North Star Companies talk with BGSU Provost Joe Whitehead.

Jerry Redman North Star vice president said the fleet of more than 20 planes with more coming on next year is one of the newest in the field with an average age of six years.

This addition is the culmination of North Star’s vision for the center.

The company has invested a total of $9.5 million at BGSU.

BGSU budget paves way for future growth

The all-funds budget approved by trustees earlier in the day reflects BGSU’s investment in in-demand programs.

Stoll reported that the university has spent $1741755 in salaries and operational costs on its new School of Nursing and Doctorate in Physical Therapy.

She praised the work of Health and Human Services administrators faculty and staff for their work bringing the two programs up to steam. The doctorate in physical therapy begins in fall.

“Bringing programs to life and seeing them come to fruition does not happen by magic. These folks put in an amazing amount work during one of the most challenging periods of their professional careers” she said. “That is some truly amazing work.”

Stoll said the university is rebounding with enrollment again trending up after the pandemic disruption. That’s evident in the bottom line. The university’s state share of instruction increased by 3.7 percent about $3.1 million. This reflects BGSU’s ability not just to recruit more students but retain them through graduation.

Castellano said that the university’s retention rate which measures how many first year students stay for their sophomore year for this fall is holding steady at 79 percent. Half the state’s funding is based on the number of students who graduate.

If the university could increase that to its target of 80 percent and stay there  Stoll said that could increase state funding by 1.5 percent.

The state she said has bounced back from the slump caused by the pandemic. It came back quickly enough that cuts in funding that were projected in spring 2020 were never imposed.

Looking forward she said articulating the value of a BGSU education to prospective students and their families and then delivering on that will be critical for the university.

Stoll said the new Life Design program should help connect students to the university. The budget includes $420000 as new spending for Life Design salaries and $580000 for Life Design operations.

In addition the budget includes a 2.75 percent increase in the salary pool for classified staff and administrators.

Overall BGSU will spend an additional $6.6 million in salaries and benefits which include $2.8 million for faculty a 3.8 percent increase and $832000 in new salaries.",,,,,,,,,

YASIN AKGUL/AFP via Getty Images

Shares of companies with big overseas sales are trailing domestic-focused firms according to Goldman Sachs.

A basket of stocks of domestic focused companies was outperforming firms with overseas tilt by nine percentage points.

But outperformance in this bear market merely means a smaller percentage loss.

Stocks across Wall Street have been hammered into a bear market this year but those of companies that derive the bulk of their sales outside of the US have trailed those of companies that are domestically oriented Goldman Sachs said this week.

The slump in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite has pushed the major indexes down by more than 20% in 2022 with the tech-rich Nasdaq sitting on a loss of 26%.

Analysis from Goldman Sachs published Friday showed the pain of stock losses has been particularly sharp for companies with a heavy amount of international sales. The investment bank said a basket of stocks it tracks with high domestic sales exposure has outperformed a basket of multinational stocks by nine percentage points this year.

That leaves the international basket down by 24% wider than the 15% decline in the domestic bunch. Goldman's international sales and domestic sales baskets each hold 50 S&P 500 stocks with the greatest share of non-US and domestic revenues.

Foreign sales in 2021 accounted for 29% of the $14 trillion of aggregate S&P 500 revenues compared with 28% in 2020.

What's helped provide upside support for US-focused companies is the climb in the trade-weighted US dollar's value Goldman said.

The US Dollar Index which measures the greenback's performance against six other currencies this year has soared to fresh 20-year highs above the 105 level. But dollar strength can hurt multinational companies in part as it makes their products more expensive for holders of other currencies to purchase.

What's also put pressure on the multinationals basket is the Information Technology sector as it rakes in 59% of its revenue from overseas. Tech stocks have plunged as the climb in interest rates can lead to chipped prospects for future profit. The materials sector is the only other one that makes most of its revenue from overseas at 50%.

The largest region of non-US exposure was Asia Pacific at 9% or $1 trillion followed by Europe at 6% or $846 billion. But only 3% or $370 billion of S&P 500 revenues were explicitly from Greater China said Goldman which conducted its analysis on recent 10-K annual corporate filings.

On a regional basis it said Monolithic Power Qualcomm and Las Vegas Sands were the companies with the largest revenue exposure to Greater China. In Greater Europe the list was topped by travel services company Bookings and gold miner Newmont.

After initially announcing that the money would go to Planned Parenthood she responded to a comment adding that money will be directed toward Abortion Funds as well.

“The most important thing is action & loud voices. @PPFA @AbortionFunds & organizations like them— will need funding to continue offering services to people who are most harmed by this ban” she continued directing fans to her Lizzo Loves You website which she launched to help black organizations in observation of Juneteenth.

“Black women & women of color have historically had disproportionately less access to family planning resources— this is a great loss but not a new one” Lizzo added.

Live Nation is also among the music companies — also including CAA Sony Music Tidal UTA the Walt Disney Company Warner Music and WME — that have said they will reimbursement for travel if it is required to access healthcare services including reproductive healthcare services among other initiatives. In an internal memo Warner also said it is supporting the Center for Reproductive Rights and will match employee donations to the organization through July 31.

While Lizzo and Live Nation’s action was one of the first sizable donations from the entertainment world theirs were hardly the only voices dissenting the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Wade earlier that day.

The group has raised $475000 so far in charity tickets for concerts at the Elkhorn Wis. Alpine Valley Music Theatre and Chicago's United Center. Those proceeds will go to reproductive rights organizations in Wisconsin and Illinois the band announced.

""We are disgusted by the repeal of Roe v. Wade and the devastating impact it will have on tens of millions of people"" the group wrote on Instagram. ""Over half of the country (26 states) is likely to ban or seriously restrict abortion very soon if not immediately which will have a disproportionate impact on poor working-class and undocumented BIPOC communities.""

Lizzo was already feeling mad as hell at the Supreme Court and has vowed to do something about it.

The singer announced on social media that she and Live Nation will donate $1 million to support access to reproductive health care following the court's decision on Friday overturning Roe v. Wade.

""The most important thing is action & loud voices"" she tweeted. ""@PPFA @AbortionFunds & organizations like them— will need funding to continue offering services to people who are most harmed by this ban.""

Lizzo pledged $500000 from the profits of her Special Tour to Planned Parenthood and the National Network of Abortion Funds and Live Nation agreed to match that amount.

She also encouraged fans to donate and volunteer on her website writing ""Black women & women of color have historically had disproportionately less access to family planning resources — this is a great loss but not a new one.""

Lizzo's Special tour kicks off Sept. 23 in Sunrise Fla. with opening act Latto.

To combat the menace of these ‘undetectable’ missiles the US is working on a hypersonic interceptor program.

The US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is working on a Glide Interceptor Program (GIP) to track and kill hypersonic missiles when they are in the glide phase of the flight i.e. once a missile has re-entered Earth’s atmosphere and is heading toward its target.

American defense contractors – Northrop Grumman Lockheed Martin and Raytheon were chosen by the MDA to design the glide phase interceptor last November (GPI).

For the initial development Northrop Grumman received $18.95 million Lockheed Martin $20.94 million and Raytheon Missiles and Defense $20.97 million each as noted by EurAsian Times.

In a new development Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman have been awarded contracts to develop hypersonic weapons interceptors under the direction of the MDA per a June 24 Pentagon announcement. It essentially means that Lockheed Martin has been eliminated from the program.

A firm-fixed-price adjustment to an earlier contract for rapid prototyping was given to each company. According to the contract announcement each change is worth around $41.5 million increasing the total contract value up to this point to about $61 million each.

The interceptors are being designed to be integrated with the current Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense destroyers used by the US Navy. It will be launched using its standard Vertical Launch System and combined with the Baseline 9 Aegis Weapon System which identifies tracks engages and destroys threats traveling at or above the speed of sound.

To launch a defensive hypersonic weapon in the summer of 2020 the MDA halted its hypersonic weapons interceptor development.

However in 2021 the MDA Chief had told Defense News that the agency was making efforts to advance once more and that comments from the industry confirmed a glide phase interceptor is something that can be done and “and we shouldn’t be afraid to go do it.”

Is Lockheed Martin Shunned?

The contract will reduce the number of companies developing the systems to just two as was anticipated last month. However as with any defense contract companies that did not win have the right to protest the decision.

It is not sure whether Lockheed Martin would dispute the decision given that it is already working on other aspects of hypersonic technology.

Despite not having secured a contract to participate in the following stage of the GPI competition Lockheed is competing against Raytheon to construct scramjet-powered hypersonic missiles under the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) effort which is run by the Air Force and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Russia’s 200 Year-Old ‘Artillery First’ Doctrine That Devastated Ukraine Even Outranges & Outguns US Systems

During a successful technology test for the US military announced by DARPA in April a Lockheed Martin hypersonic missile prototype flew at five times the speed of sound “for an extended period.” DARPA and Pentagon officials passed the test as a significant milestone.

Lockheed is the primary systems integrator for the Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon and the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike offensive hypersonic missile. The motor for both weapons however has been developed by Northrop Grumman. Lockheed is also developing the hypersonic AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon for the Air Force.

Not just that MDA has also stated that it could take back Lockheed Martin in the GPI program at a later stage. So while the contractor is out of this deal for now it is still very much riding the American hypersonic program which has received a fresh impetus due to Russian and Chinese possession of hypersonic missiles and the possibility of using them in a potential escalation with the United States.

Anti-Hypersonic System

The threat posed by China and Russia’s hypersonic weapons has recently caused the US to grow more concerned especially since it lags far behind the two with its hypersonic weapon still in the development and testing stage.

The US military brass became highly concerned when China conducted a test of their hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) in July 2021.

According to a US Defense Intelligence Agency report the glide vehicle traveled around 24800 miles (39911 kilometers) in space before re-entering the atmosphere and hitting the ground target (DIA).

Later some Pentagon Officials revealed that China had also dropped a submunition in the South China Sea during its hypersonic flight. This capability has not been demonstrated even by Russia which has the most mature hypersonic program.

Further with tensions escalating between China and the US in the Indo-Pacific region China could quickly strike American assets in the Pacific with its hypersonic missiles.

Meanwhile Russia became the first country in the world to use a hypersonic missile in combat when it fired its Kinzhal hypersonic missile to strike a target inside the territory of Ukraine.

It has three operational hypersonic weapons- Khinzal Avangard and Tsirkon. Further it plans to integrate the Avangard with its nuclear-capable Sarmat missile which will be commissioned later this year.

China on its part also claims to have developed an anti-hypersonic system that it claims uses an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict the trajectory of a hypersonic glide missile as it approaches its target.

Against that background developing an operational and comparable hypersonic missile and an interceptor becomes inevitable for ensuring American security and meeting the security challenges of the 21st century.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzI2L25hc2Etd2FudHMtdG8tcHV0LW51Y2xlYXItcmVhY3Rvci1vbi10aGUtbW9vbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA wants to put nuclear reactor on the moon hopes to support lunar life,"NASA is one step closer to finalizing nuclear power some 238900 miles away from Earth.

The space agency and the US Department of Energy have selected three design concept proposals for a fission surface power system that would be stationed on the moon.



The hope is that a nuclear reactor would produce the power needed to operate rovers conduct experiments and help support life.

Scientists say that the concepts for the technology will benefit future exploration under the Artemis umbrella and will be ready to launch by the end of the decade.

The contracts fund the development of initial design concepts for a 40-kilowatt class fission power system planned to last at least 10 years in the lunar environment and valued at approximately $5 million each NASA says. Forty kilowatts of power is enough to run 30 households for ten years continuously.

The Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory will award 12-month contracts to the following companies to each develop preliminary designs:

Lockheed Martin of Bethesda Maryland – The company will partner with BWXT and Creare.

Westinghouse of Cranberry Township Pennsylvania – The company will partner with Aerojet Rocketdyne.

IX of Houston Texas a joint venture of Intuitive Machines and X-Energy – The company will partner with Maxar and Boeing.

A nuclear reactor could produce the power needed to operate rovers conduct experiments and help support life on the moon. NASA

“The Fission Surface Power project is a very achievable first step toward the United States establishing nuclear power on the Moon” said Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner. “I look forward to seeing what each of these teams will accomplish.”

“Plentiful energy will be key to future space exploration” said Jim Reuter associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) in Washington. “I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the Moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth.”

The system will be relatively small and lightweight compared to other power systems. Fission systems are reliable and could enable continuous power regardless of location sunlight and other natural environmental conditions.

NASA says that phase one of the program will provide them with critical information from an industry that can lead to the joint development of a complete flight-certified fission power system.

“Developing these early designs will help us lay the groundwork for powering our long-term human presence on other worlds” Reuter said.

Fission surface power technologies will also help NASA mature nuclear propulsion systems that rely on reactors to generate power and could potentially be used in deep space exploration missions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xteHQtaXMtYS1mbHlpbmctZ2FzLXN0YXRpb24tZm9yLWZ1dHVyZS13YXJzLW9ubHktbWlsaXRhcnktYWlyY3JhZnQtYXJlLWFsbG93ZWQtYS1zaXAtMTkxOTg2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LMXT Is a Flying Gas Station for Future Wars Only Military Aircraft Are Allowed a Sip,"Of all the militaries in the world the American one has the largest fleet of aerial tankers.

The U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) now going through a full-blown modernization and streamlining process plans to cut that number to about 450 but also replace some of the existing hardware it uses for such tasks. As you’re reading this American fighter and transport planes but also helicopters get their fill mid-air from the likes of the KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-46 Pegasus the pillars of this fleet.Most of these planes are getting old though and the U.S. has plans to replace some of them for the future shrunken lineup. And the Lockheed Martin - Airbus LMXT seems to be one of the best solutions at hand.Described by the companies making it “America’s next strategic tanker” the LMXT is part of the Air Force’s KC-Y program. It is in fact a modified Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) it in turn based on the civilian A330. The MRTT is in the service of about 14 countries with about 60 units ordered thus far.The American LMXT will be the most advanced variant of the European-made flying platform and most importantly it will be put together in the U.S.  in Mobile Alabama and Marietta Georgia. The thing that sets it apart from the pack the fully automatic boom (the air-to-air refueling system) will be made in Arkansas at a new facility Airbus is planning to erect.The plane is 193 feet (59 meters) long and 57 feet (17 meters) high. From wing tip to wing tip it measures 198 feet (60 meters) and it comes with a maximum takeoff weight of 533500 lbs (242000 kg). Of that 271700 lbs (123240 kg) is fuel for the military aircraft in need of it.All that fuel will be sent to the recipient tanks by something Lockheed Martin and Airbus describe as the world’s first fully automatic boom/air-to-air refueling (A3R) system (check second video below the text) a fly-by-wire system that will allow faster refueling operations at increased range.It was back in 2020 when Airbus announced it achieved the world’s first fully automatic refueling contacts. The missions took place over the Atlantic Ocean where the MRTT refueled a Portuguese Air Force F-16 What fully automatic means in this case is that the A3R boom once deployed keeps the alignment between its tip and the receiver receptacle on its own “with an accuracy of a couple of centimeters.”The system also determines “the optimum moment to extend the telescopic beam to achieve the connection with the receiver.” Once that happens the fuel transfer is a go. Once the receiver plane’s tanks are full the boom disconnects gets clear and retracts.During all of this the air refueling operator (ARO) is reduced to just an observer ready to jump in if and only when something goes wrong.At the time of writing the boom system deployed on the Airbus machine is certified for refueling no less than ten aircraft namely the F-35A F-22 F-16 A-10 B1-B C-17 E-3 E-7 F-15 P-8A.Aside from being a capable refueler the LMXT is also envisioned as a Joint All Domain Operations node meaning it will integrate and be integrated with air land maritime cyberspace and space assets (first video below for more details).More details on the LMXT (but of course not all) will be released as work on the project progresses. Presently the tanker aircraft is scheduled to start rolling off production lines by the end of the decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA2L21kYS10YXBzLXJheXRoZW9uLXRvLWNvbnRpbnVlLWRldmVsb3BpbmctY291bnRlci1oeXBlcnNvbmljLW1pc3NpbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MDA taps Raytheon to continue developing counter-hypersonic missile,"MDA taps Raytheon to continue developing counter-hypersonic missile The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has selected Raytheon Missiles & Defense a Raytheon Technologies business to continue to develop a first-of-its-kind counter-hypersonic missile the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI).

Glide Phase Interceptor will defend against advanced hypersonic threats.

Raytheon press release

GPI is designed to intercept hypersonic weapons in the glide phase of flight providing the U.S. and allies with an additional layer of defense against regional hypersonic missile threats.

This firm fixed price Other Transaction Agreement modification valued at $41 million increases the total value to $62 million and allows Raytheon Missiles & Defense to continue maturing its GPI design using advanced materials and technology required to intercept a hypersonic threat. This phase will also finalize systems requirements and support accelerated development timelines.

“Our GPI is built on proven missile defense technology as its foundation. By using digital engineering and leveraging high technology readiness level components and subsystems already in use across Standard Missile and hypersonic programs we can quickly advance the creation of this new interceptor.”

Tay Fitzgerald president of Strategic Missile Defense at Raytheon Missiles & Defense

Raytheon Missiles & Defense is leveraging mature technologies from across the current portfolio to create efficiencies reduce qualification time and demonstrate the GPI capability as quickly as possible.

Raytheon Technologies’ missile defense portfolio combines sensors interceptors and command and control networks to track and defeat a wide range of threats. With more than 50 years of combat proven interceptor development integration and production experience the company is responsible for portions of nearly every air and missile defense system deployed by the U.S. and its allies. By evolving its missile interceptors directed energy and cyber technologies Raytheon Technologies is advancing counter-hypersonic solutions.

Naval News comments:

Shipping traditional fossil fuels up there is impractical and surface solar cells won’t work for the two weeks that a given side of the Moon is shadowed. So the best option may be to set up a nuclear power station. NASA solicited some ideas along those lines with a preliminary design request for proposal – and they recently announced that three groups would each receive $5 million to develop preliminary designs for surface-based lunar fission reactors.

The names of the companies that received the funding probably won’t surprise anyone closely tied to the nuclear industry. They include:

Lockheed Martin partnering with BWXT and Creare

Westinghouse partnering with Aerojet Rocketdyne

IX (a joint venture of Intuitive Machines and X-Energy) partnering with Maxar Technologies and Boeing.

The cross-disciplinary nature of the project requires companies that are nuclear specialists (such as Westinghouse) to coordinate with rocketry specialists (such as Aerojet). The project is run by a combination of NASA and Department of Energy labs with the DoE’s Idaho National Laboratory taking the lead on the project. At the same time NASA contributes expertise from their fission surface power project at Glenn and the funding comes from the Space Technology Mission Directorate based at Marshall.

The RFP was initially released in November with proposals due in March. Now the awardees each of whom will have $5 million to work with will have 12 months to work on their initial design concepts for a 40 kW fission reactor that can operate on the lunar surface for at least ten years.

The companies don’t have to start from scratch though – they can leverage a former NASA project that ended in 2018 that aimed to create a reactor that could survive on the Moon. Known as the Kilopower Reactor Using Stirling Technology it was mantled with the humorous nickname of KRUSTY.

KRUSTY which operated in collaboration with the National Nuclear Safety Administration used a Stirling engine rather than the typical water-based heat engine most nuclear power plants are designed around. Using a Sterling engine which relies on gas rather than heavier liquid is one way to save weight and solve some energy problems that would plague liquid-based heat engines.

Workers install the vacuum chamber around the KRUSTY experiment.

There’s still a long way to go before any fission reaction takes place on the Moon though. At the earliest a test reactor might be ready in the early 2030s. But most exploration experts agree that nuclear’s consistent reliable power will be absolutely critical to humanity’s efforts for a sustained presence in the solar system. With the output of these projects in hand in a year NASA will be one step close to realizing that critical goal.

LOW,Lowe's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZXJhbGxlcmdpYy5jb20vNzI2MzkwL2Etc3BvdGxpZ2h0LW9uLW5hdmFqby1maWxtbWFrZXItYmxhY2tob3JzZS1sb3dlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Spotlight on Navajo Filmmaker Blackhorse Lowe,"Blackhorse Lowe on the set of Reservation Dogs (all photo courtesy Blackhorse Lowe unless stated otherwise)

TULSA — “I’m focused on contemporary Native American stories the modern-day ups and downs of that lifestyle but I’m not trying to do it in a traditional manner” said filmmaker Blackhorse Lowe in a phone interview with Hyperallergic. “I’m more interested in the people who are on the threads of our society — you know artists drug dealers former drug pushers medicine people — people you don’t really see in the Native spotlight.”

That non-traditional approach has helped bring significant attention to Lowe who is from the Navajo Nation as a 2012 Sundance Institute Native Producing Fellow a recipient of a Re:New Media Award and an alum of the Sundance Institute’s NativeLab Producers Lab and Screenwriters Writers Lab. He also directed two episodes in the first season of the groundbreaking FX series Reservation Dogs from co-creators and executive producers Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi and is now working on the second season.

In addition Lowe is in his fourth year of the Tulsa Artist Fellowship established by the George Kaiser Family Foundation in 2015 which welcomes “socially invested arts practitioners to live and work” in a city that is “distinctly positioned at the center of coastal cultural conversations” as described on the program’s website. The fellowship has quickly become a revered support structure and dynamic platform for both established and emerging artists.

Lowe’s path to recognition includes a string of awards including Best Cinematography prize at the Terres en Vues/Land InSights Montreal First Peoples Festival in 2016 for Chasing the Light. The film which has screened at domestic and international film festivals such as imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival Skabmagovat Film Festival and the Maoriland Film Festival follows main character Riggs (Lowe) as he fails to write a script his friends interrupt his suicide attempts and drug deals go awry each scene tinged with melancholy and heartbreak over his ex-girlfriend. The film is a stripped-down black-and-white day-in-the-life Jarmuschian-type narrative about relationships depression and the powerful forces of addiction whether to substances or emotions.

Shimásáni a short film that Lowe wrote and directed is a 1930s period piece based on his grandmother her upbringing and her desire to go to boarding school. Lowe explains “I wanted to tap into my roots and then into my family’s roots and to think more about Navajo experiences from that time.” The film earned him the New Mexico New Visions Contract Award and Panavision Award. It premiered at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival and screened at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival as well as other festivals around the world picking up multiple awards and accolades along the way. “Still to this day Shimásáni is probably one of my strongest films and continually brings work my way” he said.

Lowe’s filmic style and aesthetic choices are broad. He responds to the story begging to be told rather than operating with any preconceived notions about the genre or medium.

From Chasing the Light (2016) dir. Blackhorse Lowe

“Sometimes my inspiration comes from characters sometimes it’s music sometimes it’s just something somebody tells me and then my brain will blossom with all these new ideas to attach to it. So I never know exactly where it’s gonna come from. But when I’m able to catch it I just try to put it all on paper then hopefully put it on screen later” he explains.

Lowe’s feature directorial debut 5th World which premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival highlights his interest in matching characters settings and feelings. Long camera shots show Andrei (Sheldon Silentwalker) and Aria (Livandrea Knoki) seemingly inseparable from the Navajo reservation landscape they traverse as they experience the disruption and fallout that can come with falling in love too quickly scored with songs by Corey Allison Ecliptic Gruv and others.

According to Lowe “When I did 5th World — which ended up becoming a road story about two kids falling in love and hitchhiking through Arizona and New Mexico — a lot of the music I was listening to at the time had a specific sound and feeling. So I wanted to find that feeling and make it into a feature film.”

From Shimásáni (2009) with Carmelita B. Lowe Noelle Brown and Larry A. Lowe

During his time living and working in Albuquerque Lowe was busy with the Sundance Native initiative mentoring and helping other people develop their work and their voice. Yet he states “Once I saw that the Tulsa Artist Fellowship was very much on board with me focusing on my own practice and really developing my own artistic voice … I thought it’d be perfect time to really focus on getting my stories told and getting my vision up on the screen.”

Lowe discovered the Tulsa Artist Fellowship through friends and collaborators including Harjo and Nathan Young who now works for the organization as the public programs producer. The fellowship awards a $25000 stipend and $10000 in project resources as well as free accommodation and studio space plus additional forms of support to designated fellows. As for the geographic relevance? “The state of Oklahoma is home to 39 tribal Nations and the city of Tulsa is deeply shaped by its rich Native American cultural landscape” Young told Hyperallergic. “Tulsa Artist Fellowship is dedicated to celebrating and supporting Native arts.”

Lowe finished his most recent film Fukry in Tulsa and he also received an Arts Integration Award alongside Atomic Culture for his continued work with the local community in the form of Cinetelechy Lab an intergenerational storytelling mentorship. Although COVID interrupted previous plans this year the Lab aims to do a full-blown media festival.

Lowe says he’s always been interested in film for which he (lovingly) blames his parents. His mom showed him The Godfather earlier on and his father was a huge fan of Spaghetti Westerns. Lowe remembers watching those films along with Apocalypse Now and Conan the Barbarian with his grandfather as well as sci-fi films like Escape from New York with his uncle while other relatives showed him “weird Italian horror films.” And he has a memory of his dad mistakenly renting Eraserhead. “It blew my mind — freaked me out but definitely drew my interest” he notes.

When his mom wasn’t using her collection of 35-millimeter and early VHS cameras for documenting family get-togethers Lowe and his brother and sister would recreate scenes from the likes of The Road Warrior Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Growing up on a big farm they didn’t have many friends nearby so they created their own little worlds by making short films. His interest grew from there and after studying painting photography and creative writing he put all his focus into filmmaking at Scottsdale Community College the most affordable film school he could find.

“All of my themes kind of come from my earliest teachings and understandings of story which come from the Navajo creation story. So I try to apply it to what’s going on now but with a more modern darker sensibility” he said. “I’m always more interested in the people who have to go through the spiritual struggles just trying to find a way out of darker places and into the light.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvd2hhdC1saW5kc2F5LXllbnRlci1kb2luZy1zaW5jZS1zZWFuLWxvd2Utc2Vhc29uLXRoZS1iYWNoZWxvci5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Has Lindsay Yenter Been Doing Since Sean Lowe's Season of 'The Bachelor'?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvd2hhdC1saW5kc2F5LXllbnRlci1kb2luZy1zaW5jZS1zZWFuLWxvd2Utc2Vhc29uLXRoZS1iYWNoZWxvci5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000029D4983F160>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvd2hhdC1saW5kc2F5LXllbnRlci1kb2luZy1zaW5jZS1zZWFuLWxvd2Utc2Vhc29uLXRoZS1iYWNoZWxvci5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3RyYWN0aWZ5LmNvbS9wL3doYXQtaGFwcGVuZWQtdG8tYmVybmFyZC13ZXN0d29ybGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Happened to Bernard Lowe in 'Westworld'?

What happened to Bernard in 'Westworld'?

To start ""Bernard Lowe"" is not a human being — anymore. Bernard is an android or ""host"" made with the image and memories of Arnold Weber Westworld's co-creator and founder who is also portrayed by Jeffrey Wright. Before he was Bernard Arnold was a co-creator of Westworld the theme park alongside Dr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins).

Dolores Abernathy (Evan Rachel Wood) the farmer's daughter was the first host created. The amount of time Dolores spent with Arnold allowed Ford to replicate his friend based on Dolores' memories of him after his death. Before his death Arnold was fixated on the idea that the hosts could develop consciousness although his concerns about this idea begin to outweigh the benefits.

He reconstructs his friend in the form of top Westworld engineer Bernard Lowe (whose name is an anagram for Arnold Weber) but without Arnold's concerns about the hosts. Ford designs the hosts with ""reveries"" or the ability to remember their past pains and traumas in hopes it unlocks their consciousness.

In the meantime Delos the corporation that owns Westworld has been copying guest consciousnesses in a ""key"" inside one of the hosts Peter Abernathy (Dolores' father). After Ford turns Dolores and Teddy on the board members in a massacre hosts and humans struggle to get out of the park due to an override code by a hive mind known as ""the Cradle."" Even after death Ford's consciousness is running the show.

Dolores destroys the Cradle and gets the key from her father's mind which opens ""the Forge"" where host bodies are created. Dolores wants to destroy the Forge but after a struggle where Bernard shoots her hits a failsafe that floods Westworld. A virtual heaven known as ""the Door"" opens where the remaining hosts have their consciousnesses be at peace. Bernard decides to side with Dolores against Delos after Charlotte Hale kills his friend Elsie.

Bernard wakes up when the Delos security team arrives. It's revealed that Bernard scrambled his own memories in the Forge and placed Dolores' drive inside a host Charlotte killing the real Charlotte. Char-lores grabs the virtual Eden data 5 ""mind pearls"" and gets out. Chief Security Officer Ashley Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) is also a host with his goal to protect other hosts. He makes it out of the park with Char-lores. The Man in Black is also able to escape the park.

Char-lores discovers a small Forge in Bernard's (Arnold's) home on the mainland where she creates a new body for Bernard and a new Dolores body. Three months later Bernard is in hiding after being accused of the Westworld massacre and Dolores is still bent on the robot revolution. Meanwhile she has implanted the key to all the host data in Bernard's mind in hopes of creating a world where the hosts are ""truly free.""

Stubbs and Bernard rescue the Man in Black from a mental institution where he has spent time wondering if he's a host. Unfortunately the Man in Black attempts to kill them both but Dolores sends a rescue party and takes Bernard to visit his human wife who has been suffering from dementia. The season ends with Bernard realizing he has the park data in his head and learning to access it.

Season 4 of Westworld could see Bernard accessing the virtual Eden called ""The Sublime"" and re-creating old hosts now that the forces opposing Dolores have been mostly eliminated. ""The Sublime"" also contained data that Season 3 villain Serac needed to complete a hostile takeover of the human world so now that he's gone it might be safe for Bernard ... or so fans hope.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ja2VuemllYmFubmVyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL3dpbGxpZS1lLWxvd2UtanIsMTQ4NTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Willie E.

The supply chain crisis has retailers considering the unthinkable: Instead of returning your unwanted items just keep them.

The chaotic mix of record fuel prices and an unending supply chain crisis have retailers considering the unthinkable: Instead of returning your unwanted items just keep them.

In recent weeks some of the biggest store chains including Target Walmart Gap American Eagle Outfitters and others have reported in their latest earnings calls that they have too much inventory of stuff ranging from workout clothes spring-time jackets and hoodies to garden furniture and bulky kids' toys. It's costing them tons of money to store it.

Now add on to that glut another category of product that stores have to deal with: returns.

So instead of piling returned merchandise onto this growing inventory heap stores are considering just handing customers their money back and letting them hang onto the stuff they don't want.

""It would be a smart strategic initiative"" said Burt Flickinger retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. ""Retailers are stuck with excess inventory of unprecedented levels. They can't afford to take back even more of it.""

Returned products are handled in a number of different ways he said. Retailers take back merchandise from the customer evaluate it and if it's in good condition put it back on the shelf at the same or lesser price.

They can refurbish damaged returns and sell them for less or offload them to liquidators to resell. They also can sell returned products to foreign liquidators for sale in Europe Canada or Mexico.

""Given the situation at the ports and the container shortages sending product overseas isn't really an option"" said Flickinger. Lastly retailers can hire third party firms to handle all aspect of merchandise returns for them.

Each of these options however tack on additional costs for retailers he said.

""For every dollar in sales a retailer's net profit is between a cent to five cents. With returns for every dollar in returned merchandise it costs a retailer between 15 cents to 30 cents to handle it"" said Flickinger.

There is one other option for retailers to address returns while avoiding more product bloat and that's to consider a 'returnless return' said Steve Rop chief operating officer with goTRG a firm that processes over 100 million returned items annually for companies like Wal-Mart Amazon and Lowe's.

Just keep it

Rop said his company's clients are 100% considering offering the ""keep it"" option for returns this year although he wouldn't disclose if any of his customers have implemented the ""Keep it"" returns policy yet.

In some instances when they determine it would be easier some retailers advise customers to just keep or donate their return after issuing a refund. Walmart said it had nothing to share at this time. Lowe's didn't provide a comment for the story.

""They're already discounting in stores to clear out products but when there's heavy discounting buyer's remorse goes up. People are tempted to buy a lot to only return it later"" he said.

Refunding customers while simultaneously letting them keep their returns isn't a new practice said Rop. ""It started with Amazon several years ago"" he said.

The offer makes sense for some types of products -- lower price-tier bulky items like furniture kitchen appliances home decor baby chairs walkers strollers where it's costly for the retailer to cover the shipping cost for the return.

""Other products like kids' toys footwear towels and bedding raise sanitary concerns when it comes to returns. It could also apply to these categories"" he said.

Another concern with cheaper items: Stores typically discount returned products so the amount of money they can make on an inexpensive return is miniscule -- and may not be worth the tradeoff says Keith Daniels partner with Carl Marks Advisors.

Still a ""keep it"" policy has its own disadvantages namely: Companies will need to ensure that they don't become victims of fraud.

""One thing retailers need to track and ensure is that customers that become aware of the (Keep it) policy do not begin to abuse it by seeking free merchandise over a series of orders by getting a refund but getting to keep the merchandise"" said Daniels.

When the petrochemical maker LyondellBasell Industries announced in April that it would close its century-old refinery in Houston by the end of 2023 the news was hardly a surprise. The facility which processes heavy imported crude oil to make fuels and aromatics had lost money for the past 3 years. LyondellBasell had been looking to sell it since September to no avail.

What was unusual about the announcement was then–interim CEO Ken Lane’s declaration in a press release that shutting the unit “advances the Company’s decarbonization goals.” The refinery accounts for nearly 15% of LyondellBasell’s emissions from industrial processes and purchased energy.

In a conference call later that month Lane added that the 300-hectare site would be ideal for Lyondell to repurpose for sustainability initiatives. The company has been piloting a pyrolysis process that breaks down postconsumer plastics into petrochemical feedstocks and the Houston refinery has hydrotreaters that can aid the process. The site Lane told analysts “could be very synergistic with our circular ambition.”

For decades major corporate decisions like shutting divesting acquiring and spinning off businesses were motivated mainly by dollars and cents. A big chemical company might for example sell a commodity chemical business to focus on higher-growth and more-profitable specialty chemicals. Now executives at such companies are increasingly weighing environmental impact—carbon footprint in particular. In just the past few months Evonik Industries Solvay Lanxess and Trinseo all highlighted the environmental benefits of major portfolio maneuvers.

Managers at these companies have made the shift because shareholders are demanding it. A growing number of mutual funds managed by institutional investors are evaluating the environmental social and governance (ESG) performance of the companies they hold stock in. To attract these investors companies must aspire to ambitious environmental goals. As a consequence executives are allocating a significant share of their capital spending toward ­sustainability and are making environmental performance part of their merger and acquisition strategy.

Environmental action incentivized by Wall Street might seem like an unambiguous good. But critics caution that chemical companies could dress up their environmental performance by divesting their dirtier operations to firms that don’t care as much resulting in little gain—and perhaps even a loss—for the planet.

ESG concerns are now impossible for executives to ignore. Investment in funds that consider ESG performance in their selection criteria is growing at a 15% annual rate and is set to reach $41 trillion globally this year according to Bloomberg Intelligence. ESG holdings the consulting firm says represent roughly a third of total assets under management.

You don’t want to sell to someone with a poor reputation just like you don’t want to buy something that has a poor reputation. Omar Diaz managing director Balmoral Advisors

Institutional investors say companies have a social responsibility beyond hitting their quarterly earnings targets. And they argue that having high standards for sustainability makes good business sense.

Larry Fink the CEO of BlackRock an asset management firm with $10 trillion in assets is a leading light of the ESG movement. His annual letter to CEOs is treated like a papal encyclical. “I believe the decarbonizing of the global economy is going to create the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime” reads the most recent one issued in January. It later asks “As your industry gets transformed by the energy transition will you go the way of the dodo or will you be a phoenix?”

Most chemical companies want to be a phoenix. One of them is Dow the largest US chemical maker. Howard Ungerleider Dow’s president and chief financial officer is quick to point out that the company has been focusing on sustainability for longer than most. “We are in the third decade of setting 10-year sustainability goals” he says. “The first set was 1995.”

Like Fink Ungerleider sees business advantages in elevating ESG. For instance he says consumers are now willing to pay for more environmentally responsible products. “It’s just the right thing to do as human beings as individuals in society but also it’s the right thing to do for the enterprise” he says.

Investors’ growing interest in ESG funds is another motivator for the increased focus on sustainability. “I would not say it’s the leading motivation” Ungerleider says. “But obviously anywhere you can make sure that you’re giving yourself as large a potential shareholder base as possible is in the direction of goodness.”

Ungerleider adds that Dow has “gotten good feedback from investors” for major ESG advances like in 2020 when it set a goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It also received positive investor response in October when it announced specific zero-carbon plans—notably the world’s first ethylene cracker that will capture its carbon emissions.

Overall Dow plans to spend $1 billion per year about a third of its capital budget on decarbonization. This level of spending could become the norm for the petrochemical industry. According to BloombergNEF the sector will need to outlay a total of $759 billion by 2050 to nearly eliminate carbon emissions.

With such high levels of capital spending required to reach emission goals major chemical companies are not surprisingly looking to trim or exit their more carbon-intensive businesses to reduce the amount of investment they will need to meet their targets.

Growing importance



Bernd Elser global chemical lead at the consulting firm Accenture says the number of chemical deals in which sustainability was stated as part of the rationale has spiked in recent years hitting a record of nearly $10 billion in transaction value in 2021. “We see a lot of divestments being communicated where businesses with a significant share of the greenhouse footprint of the overall company are divested” Elser says. “I think that’s a game changer.”

In May for example Evonik Industries said it would divest its performance materials businesses by the end of 2023. They include most of its bulk chemical operations—such as C ₄ chemicals isononyl alcohol and superabsorbent polymers—and generate about $3 billion in annual sales 20% of Evonik’s total.

The company noted that these businesses emit about 20% of its greenhouse gases. Evonik aims to cut emissions by 25% by 2030. What’s more the company plans to redeploy the proceeds it gets from the asset sales toward a $3.2 billion investment in sustainable businesses.

“We are even more systematically integrating sustainability into all elements of our strategy into portfolio management into innovation steering into capital allocation and into our culture” Evonik CEO Christian Kullmann told analysts when he unveiled the plan in a presentation.

Another European chemical maker Solvay announced in March that it will split in two. One firm with about $4.5 billion in annual sales will house Solvay’s commodity businesses such as soda ash and peroxides. A separate $6.6 billion company will hold its specialty chemical and polymer businesses.

In 2021 Solvay set a goal of reaching net-zero carbon dioxide emissions before 2050 and the soda ash business was going to be among the last to reach this target. After the split the specialty chemical company will have a net-zero target of 2040.

A series of deals is likewise improving Trinseo’s sustainability profile. In December the polymer firm sold its European synthetic rubber business to Poland-based rival Synthos. The unit represented about 10% of Trinseo’s sales but 25% of its greenhouse gas emissions according to the company’s sustainability report. Trinseo is now planning to divest its polystyrene and feedstock businesses which account for 28% of its sales and 46% of its emissions.

Francesca Reverberi Trinseo’s chief sustainability officer says in an email that ESG is “a key consideration of our M&A activities.” This is also true she says not only in selling but also in buying businesses and extends beyond greenhouse gas reduction. The firm’s purchase of Arkema’s acrylics business she notes has been an environmental positive because of the ease with which that polymer can be recycled. Earlier this year Trinseo bought the European plastics recycler Heathland.

Such dedication to ESG is spreading. In a survey of executives the consultancy Bain found that 65% said their focus on ESG would increase. In energy and natural resources a sector that includes chemicals the interest is acutely high: 40% of deals were motivated by ESG versus 14% for other sectors. “It was impacting what sort of deals they were pursuing. It was impacting how they conducted diligence and how they valued companies” says Whit Keuer a partner in Bain’s energy and resources practice.

Acquirers are willing to pay more for more-sustainable businesses Keuer says. Conversely they will pay less when large investments would be needed to bring assets up to higher standards. “Those things are actually being sold at discounts to what they were several years ago” he says.

Omar Diaz a managing director of Balmoral Advisors an investment bank that markets chemical businesses to potential buyers is seeing ESG considerations crop up increasingly. And he is encountering finicky buyers such as when he was trying to market a materials business that a large conglomerate wanted to sell.

“We had multiple buyers who in the past had been involved in materials businesses and they came right back at us almost immediately and said ‘This just doesn’t meet our ESG criteria’ ” Diaz says.

Conversely Diaz has encountered sellers that have ruled out certain buyers. “You don’t want to sell to someone with a poor reputation just like you don’t want to buy something that has a poor reputation” he says.

For publicly traded companies with relatively high environmental standards selling carbon-intensive businesses to private companies with a lower commitment to the environment—“transferred emissions” as it is known—could be a new hazard. BlackRock’s Fink called it out in his most recent letter to CEOs. “Divesting from entire sectors—or simply passing carbon-intensive assets from public markets to private markets—will not get the world to net zero” he wrote.

The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) released a study in May looking into this issue in the oil and gas industry. It found that over the past 5 years major oil companies with net-zero commitments sold $86.4 billion in assets to firms without such pledges.

And the EDF found evidence of more lax environmental practices at the acquiring firms. For example Shell and Eni sold an oil field in the Niger Delta to a local operator leading to increased flaring.

Gabriel Malek the lead author of the report says the issue of transferred emissions isn’t necessarily relegated to oil and gas. “Across all of these sectors whether it’s petrochemicals transportation cement and steel there’s growing pressure on public companies to begin to decarbonize and set energy-transition plans. And understandably those companies will need to begin shedding some of their most demanding assets” he says.

Malek is worried that many of those assets will go to private equity firms that aren’t focused on the long term. Most net-zero targets are nearly 30 years away. “The private equity firms that we speak to they may be looking at a 7-year window between now and when they end up selling the asset once again” he explains.

A major shift of a business from public to private hands was announced in May. The German chemical maker Lanxess and the private equity firm Advent International are forming a joint venture—to be owned at least 60% by Advent—to buy DSM’s engineering polymer business. Lanxess is contributing its own nylon and polybutylene businesses to the partnership marking an exit from polymers so it can focus on specialty chemicals.

Lanxess noted in its presentation that divesting its polymer businesses will improve its emission profile. The company has a goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2040.

Ronald Ayles an Advent managing partner says his firm will honor Lanxess’s targets for the businesses that it is acquiring. “We are one of the largest private equity funds” he says. “We set ourselves very high ESG and environmental targets.”

Ayles says the notion that private equity firms have lower environmental standards is an unfair stereotype. “Our investors behind Advent are the very large institutional investors” he says. “There’s no difference versus a public company.”But

Bain’s Keuer says a difference between public and private equity–owned companies is transparency. Public companies face pressure from green investors and the public to hold themselves to environmental targets. “Private equity is not subject to that same level of disclosure scrutiny and pressure” he says.

Ideally mergers and acquisitions would be an environmental trade up for both companies. Trinseo’s sale of its rubber business to Synthos demonstrates that this is possible.

After the deal Trinseo may more easily reach its goal of a 35% reduction in emission intensity—greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production—by 2035. And Reverberi says the company is considering instituting a net-zero target if it is technologically and financially feasible.

Synthos had not committed publicly to ambitious targets but when it closed the rubber purchase it unveiled a sustainable growth strategy. The Polish firm said it would move completely away from coal as an energy source and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 28% by 2028. It now aims for climate neutrality by 2050.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS9hbHJlYWR5LWdvbmUtdXMtcmVmaW5lcnktc2h1dGRvd25zLWEtbWFqb3ItY29udHJpYnV0b3ItdG8tcmVmaW5lZC1wcm9kdWN0LXNxdWVlemUtYW5kLWhpZ2gtcHJpY2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Already Gone - U.S. Refinery Shutdowns a Major Contributor to Refined Products Squeeze and High Prices,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://rbnenergy.com/already-gone-us-refinery-shutdowns-a-major-contributor-to-refined-product-squeeze-and-high-prices on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS9hbHJlYWR5LWdvbmUtdXMtcmVmaW5lcnktc2h1dGRvd25zLWEtbWFqb3ItY29udHJpYnV0b3ItdG8tcmVmaW5lZC1wcm9kdWN0LXNxdWVlemUtYW5kLWhpZ2gtcHJpY2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The elite schools took $10 million from 2017 to 2023 from entities within the “State of Palestine” according to the analysis by Open the Books a Republican-owned nonprofit dedicated to revealing government spending.

Brown University Harvard University and non-Ivy Indiana University of Pennsylvania are among the schools to accept funding from donors located in the nation that technically doesn’t exist at least by UN standards.

The “State of Palestine” is not a recognized entity by the United Nations or the US — though some 140 countries do officially recognize it.

3 Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Palestinians who have long been fighting for recognized statehood live in the Israel-occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank which are controlled by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority respectively.

Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from a foundation located within the “State of Palestine” to create a professorship in Palestinian Studies as part of the college’s Middle East Studies program according to federal disclosures reviewed by Open the Books.

Though the financial filing does not disclose the donor’s name Brown previously said the money was gifted by the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Nine different donors — including multiple Brown alumni and the foundation — came together to fund the “Mahmoud Darwish Professorship in Palestinian Studies” according to a 2020 press release.

Meanwhile Harvard took in $1.6 million from donors within the “State of Palestine” and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania received $6.4 million from entities within the “State of Palestine” and another $900000 from a donor from “Palestinian Territory Occupied” according to the review of the financial disclosure documents.

The donors are not identified in the filings. Harvard previously said that monies it received from Palestinian donors in 2017 2018 and 2019 did not come from the Palestinian Authority though the Ivy League would not disclose the donor names in a 2020 news report.

Most of the money helped pay for Palestinian students from the occupied territories to receive an education at American universities according to the filings.

They were often reported as “payment of tuition and fees for students from Palestine. Funds are also utilized to pay for educational-related expenses incurred by the university for these students through their enrollment in this program” the documents state according to Open the Books.

Indiana University of Pennsylvania received at least $2.3 million from the West Bank-based Arab American University to cover the tuition and other expenses for Palestinian students attending the US college according to the same 2020 report.

In addition to the funding the US universities have had ongoing relationships with universities in the West Bank.

Brown’s inaugural professor of Palestinian Studies Beshara Doumani was granted permission to simultaneously serve as the president of Birzeit University in the West Bank for two years.

The Palestinian university was criticized after its Union of Professors and Employees penned an op-ed days after Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack stating “2023 will be recorded historically as the year that Palestinians stood boldly in the face of colonial fascism and screamed in defense of their homes humanity and lives.”

For its part Indiana University of Pennsylvania offers business Ph.D. and master’s programs in partnership with Arab American University.

One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3dpc2NvbnNpbi1kZW1zLWludmVzdC03bS10di1hZHMtNS1rZXktc3RhdGUtc2VuYXRlLXJhY2Vz0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3Mvd2lzY29uc2luLWRlbXMtaW52ZXN0LTdtLXR2LWFkcy01LWtleS1zdGF0ZS1zZW5hdGUtcmFjZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wisconsin Dems invest $7M in TV ads for 5 key state Senate races,"Wisconsin Democrats plan to spend $7 million on television ads in five state Senate races they believe are key to regaining control of the chamber.

The State Senate Democratic Committee said Wednesday that the buy will target races in Milwaukee’s northern suburbs the rural areas north of Madison the Fox Cities Green Bay and La Crosse.

Republicans currently hold a 22-10 supermajority in the 33-seat Senate but Democrats hope new district boundaries Gov. Tony Evers signed in February will help them chip away at the GOP advantage.

WISCONSIN LAWMAKERS VOTE TO AUDIT STATE DEI INITIATIVES

Sixteen Senate seats are up in November including eight currently held by Republicans and four open seats. Four Democrats are not up for re-election this cycle; that means Democrats need to win 13 seats in November to gain the majority. In a sign of how the new maps have energized the party Democrats have put up a candidate in every Senate race on the ballot for the first time in more than 20 years.

Democrats plan to run ads in the 8th Senate District which includes Milwaukee's conservative leaning northern suburbs. The new maps pulled Republican Sen. Duey Stroebel out of his old district and put him in the 8th where he'll face Democrat Jodi Habush Sinykin.

Ads are also on tap in the redrawn 14th District which covers parts of Columbia Marquette Green Lake and Waupaca counties. Democrat Sarah Keyeski is running against GOP incumbent Joan Ballweg there.

The committee also will target the 18th District which now runs from Appleton south to Oshkosh along Lake Winnebago's western shore. The seat is open with Democrats Kristin Alfheim and Joseph Carmen and Republicans Anthony Phillips and Blong Yang are all running.

Ads are slated for the 30th District as well. That district covers the western shore of the bay of Green Bay from the city of Green Bay north to Marinette. The seat is open. Democrat Jamie Wall and Republican Jim Rafter are running for it.

The last district in the committee's ad buy is the 32nd in western Wisconsin where Republican Stacey Klein is looking to unseat Democratic incumbent Brad Pfaff.

Andrew Whitley the State Senate Democratic Committee's executive director said the committee picked those districts because President Joe Biden and Gov. Tony Evers won them in 2020 and 2022 respectively suggesting Democratic legislative candidates stand a good chance of success in them. The ads will be tailored to the issues in each district and will begin airing after Wisconsin's Aug. 13 primary he said.

These days everything seems like a competition. Americans are obsessed with competition—keeping up with Joneses school rivalries—heck you could stream five hours every night for years watching nothing but competition shows about dancing singing cooking baking dating surviving restoring homes and cars or even battling robots. Perhaps in response to this Yankee fascination you can now only buy the BMW X5 M or X6 M SUVs in their most extreme Competition trims.

OK the real reason for this change is because prime competitor Mercedes-AMG only offers its GLE63 SUV and Coupe in their most extreme S trims. Buyers in other markets can still get these vehicles with less extreme powertrain and suspension setups. But let’s say you don’t yet have a gut that jiggles on bumps your threshold for kidney trauma is high and/or your local weather conditions or tax base mean you only ever drive on mirror-smooth roads. How would a BMW X5 M Competition fare in you know a performance and handling competition?

Drag Race Competition

First a quick recap of the hardware basics shared in our First Look: The M’s 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 gets help from a small electric motor mounted in the transmission kicking out a combined 617 hp and 553 lb-ft. Mercedes-AMG’s smaller 4.0-liter bi-turbo V-8 is 13 percent torquier producing 603 hp and 627 lb-ft. AMG employs an extra gearbox cog too with nine versus eight. Our test cars weighed in within a single pound on our scales and their straight-line performance was equally close. Each hit 60 mph in 3.4 seconds with the deeper-lunged BMW crossing the quarter-mile mark ahead by 0.1 second and 1.4 mph in 11.8 seconds at 116.6 mph. An Audi RS Q8 and an Alfa Romeo Stelvio Q4 Quadrifoglio would be photo-finishing with these two. That performance would put both this BMW and the Benz even with or ahead of any similarly priced Porsche Cayenne we’ve tested but well behind the way spendier trims with “Turbo” in the name.

Road-Course Competition

Braking performance is similarly spot-on with each stopping from 60 mph in exactly 104 feet. But BMW opens some daylight relative to its GLE63 rival by circulating our figure-eight test course nearly a second ahead in 24.1 seconds at 0.86 g average versus 25.0 seconds at 0.78 g. The max 0.99 g force our X5 generates in the corners is also well ahead of the AMG’s 0.93 g. Usually tires explain the difference in cases like this but here both vehicles were shod in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber (although it’s possible their individual fitment specs could vary). Staggered tire and wheel sizes vary with the BMW on 21s and the AMG on 22s so we wondered if contact-patch sizes accounted for the difference. Nope. Total static contact patch area measures within 3 square inches with the Mercedes leading at 278.

So we can probably credit the BMW’s more even weight distribution superior suspension kinematics the consistency with which the brakes tolerated hard application and smooth trailing into the turns for lap after lap and/or a higher degree of stability control system tolerance for permitting limit-handling shenanigans without intervention. As for those other leading contenders? The Audi RS Q8 runs with the BMW the Alfa Stelvio Quad with the Mercedes. Our test of a base 2024 Porsche Cayenne weighing 580 pounds less than this X5 M matched its figure-eight time and hung on with 1.02 g of max cornering grip.

How Does It Work as Transportation?

As ridiculous as a 2.7-ton track car sounds that is the only use case that makes sense for SUVs as musclebound as the X5 M or GLE63. Toward that end our test unit featured the M Driver's package (S07ME) elevating top speed from 155 to 177 mph and entitling the owner to take a BMW high-performance driving course. But a savvy track-day buyer would preserve some tire and brake replacement capital by skipping both the $3100 Executive package and the $3400 Bowers & Wilkins sound upgrade. Soft-close doors a high-mounted and heavy panoramic roof and ventilated massaging seats are utterly anathema to a track car the massaging is nowhere near as effective as the best Mercedes or Lucid systems and the stereo struggles to shout down the glorious engine noises and the tiresome tire racket.

Considering this as a dedicated track rat also helps us forgive the X5 M Competition its horrendous ride and shortcomings including an automatic climate control that isn’t (fan speed remains adjustable) and its lack of basic amenities such as adaptive cruise control and lane centering (the button to select them is there but the features cost $1700 extra).

Is the X5 M Competition Competitive?

We’re still mystified by this vehicle’s purpose in life given that nobody is likely to track it. Why would they when an M2 costs half as much and is four times more fun everywhere? Frankly a more supple-riding X5 M60i producing the same torque and just 15 percent less power equipped with all the expected luxuries at $96245 makes ever so much more sense. And for anyone hellbent on spending 50 grand more the Audi RS Q8’s balance of luxury comfort and sportiness better suits the way these trucks will actually be driven.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/05/08/a-ukrainian-m-2-fighting-vehicle-sneaked-up-on-a-russian-t-80-tank-at-night-and-hit-it-with-a-missile-from-a-mile-away/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Why do they keep closing?,"Hilco Redevelopment Partners is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to convert the 1300-acre site along the Schuylkill River into a green high-tech campus for e-commerce and life sciences companies shown in this rendering. (Hilco Redevelopment Partners)

Philadelphia -- As the energy crunch drives record profits at American oil refineries the owners of what had been the largest such facility in the Northeast have no regrets about tearing the place down.

Hilco Redevelopment Partners has been hauling out 950 miles of pipe from the former Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery abandoning the property's 150-year history of processing crude oil into fuel in this city. The firm is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to convert the 1300-acre site along the Schuylkill River into a green high-tech campus for e-commerce and life sciences companies.

""I don't even know how to operate a refinery"" said Roberto Perez chief executive of Hilco which bought the property in a bankruptcy auction in 2020 a year after a massive explosion at the refinery rattled the city. ""It's not what we do.""

Oil refineries across the country are being retired and converted to other uses as owners balk at making costly upgrades and America's pivot away from fossil fuels leaves their future uncertain. The downsizing comes despite painfully high gasoline prices and as demand globally ramps up amid sanctions on gasoline and diesel produced in Russia the third-biggest petroleum refiner in the world behind the United States and China.

Five refineries have shutdown in the United States in just the past two years reducing the nation's refining capacity by about 5 percent and eliminating more than 1 million barrels of fuel per day from the market leaving the remaining facilities straining to meet demand. Yet even at this lucrative moment for what's left of the refining industry a White House desperate to bring down gas prices is having little success persuading owners to expand operations and more closures are imminent.

The futility of the White House effort came through in the response to letters President Joe Biden sent this week to the nation's major oil companies chastising them for squeezing ""historically high profit margins"" out of their refineries. ""At a time of war refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto American families are not acceptable"" Biden wrote. Biden threatened to invoke emergency powers if the companies don't bring prices down.

The companies are unmoved. The profits follow years of heavy losses at many facilities after demand plunged during the pandemic. Unpredictable shifts in oil markets had created a challenging business climate before that. Even at this moment of windfall refinery earnings when the profit margin on each barrel of oil processed has jumped from a dollar or two a year ago to as much as $18 today investors are hardly jumping at the opportunity to enter the sector. They fear the profits are short lived. The administration's environmental priorities -- as well as rising public and corporate concern about climate change -- would make many refineries obsolete in the not-too-distant future.

Building and upgrading the mammoth structures is a messy expensive undertaking that can drag on longer than a decade strain the finances of even the biggest fossil fuel giants and run the risk of getting abandoned before that investment is returned.

""I don't think you are ever going to see a refinery built again in this country"" Chevron CEO Michael Wirth said in an interview with The Washington Post this month.

""It's been 50 years since we built a new one"" Wirth said. ""In a country where the policy environment is trying to reduce demand for these products you are not going to find companies to put billions and billions of dollars into this.""

Some of the nation's 129 refineries are owned by large oil companies such as Chevron while others are operated independently. At the facilities the components of crude oil are separated and processed into fuel for vehicles and planes as well as industrial petroleum products such as lubricants.

The last major refinery to come online in the United States in 1977 is the one owned by Marathon Oil in Garyville La. It is capable of pumping out 578000 barrels per day. Since it opened more than half the refineries in the U.S. have closed.

While the Biden administration says market manipulation by Big Oil is behind the shortage of refined fuel right now the major fossil fuel companies don't have a monopoly on production. There is a large refining facility in Houston up for sale right now.

""If there was someone out there who believed this would be a strong business in the future this is an asset they could buy"" said Jacques Rousseau a managing director at ClearView Energy Partners an independent research firm.

The problem: Nobody wants to buy it. There has not been a single viable bid.

In the absence of any offers LyondellBasell plans to shut its 700-acre operation on the Gulf Coast no later than the end of next year. Quitting the refining business the company said in a statement ""is the best strategic and financial path forward."" The company did not comment on industry speculation that a fire that knocked part of its century-old Houston facility offline last week may push the closure date even sooner as LyondellBasell faces the prospect of costly repairs.

The facility refines about 264000 barrels of crude oil per day.

""These are aging physical plants where steel needs to be replaced equipment needs to be overhauled new pumps maybe needed"" said Ed Hirs an energy economist at the University of Houston.

""Just getting the equipment you need could take three years. Electric vehicles might already make up 20 percent of the car market by then. You could find yourself investing a bunch of cash to rebuild a refinery that may not be needed for long.""

The White House would have to take extreme steps to compel companies to refine more right now. That could involve Biden invoking emergency powers to curb exports of refined gasoline and diesel or to force companies to restart operations at idled American refineries according to a memo ClearView sent clients.

The president wrote in his letter that he is ""prepared to use all tools at my disposal"" to bring prices down scolding oil executives for making record profits off a refining shortage that is ""blunting the impact of the historic actions"" by the White House to confront soaring gas prices. Those actions included releasing 1 million barrels per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the suspension of an environmental rule limiting high blends of ethanol into gasoline in the summer.

Analysts caution that any actions the White House tries to take to spur more production could backfire. Curbing exports for example would intensify fuel shortages in Europe and could lead to further political destabilization there. It could also motivate companies to move more operations overseas worsening shortages in the United States.

""The problem is we are running the existing refineries at full power"" said Jason Bordoff founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. ""There is not a lot of ability to require industry to refine more than it already is.""

The case of the shuttered Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery illustrates how little influence the White House has over such operations.

The Trump administration had worked aggressively to keep the plant that was churning out 335000 barrels of fuel per day from closing warning it played an important role in U.S. energy security and independence. The White House had dispatched Peter Navarro a top Trump economic adviser to try to help advance the bid of a group of energy executives who planned to rehabilitate the bankrupt facility.

The bid which had the backing of organized labor fizzled.

The city was emerging from the trauma of a refinery explosion that sent an enormous fireball over the area and catapulted large pieces of machinery throughout the property. A 38000-pound fragment of the plant was hurled across the river by the explosion. Nobody was killed but 3271 pounds of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid leaked into the community. It can cause lung damage and severe skin burns according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The explosion was triggered by a pipe that had not been inspected since 1973. It was so corroded that the pipe's metal had become thinner than a credit card according to investigators from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board. The board noted that such corrosion had been the culprit in earlier refinery explosions in California and Utah and ""it's just a matter of time"" before another such explosion at a refinery leads to fatalities or contamination of a community.

The Philadelphia refinery had already fallen into bankruptcy the year before it was engulfed by fire. New pipelines from the North Dakota Bakken region and the Permian Basin in Texas had begun pumping crude directly to Gulf Coast and Midwest refineries. Those refineries could then afford to sell their products much more cheaply than the Philadelphia facility which could access the North Dakota and Texas crude only through rail car shipments.

Like many of the nation's refineries the one in Philadelphia was not equipped to process all types of crude. It could not for example handle the heavy crudes from Canadian tar sands that became available on the market for cheap pushing the Philadelphia facility into further financial despair.

The refinery was also not equipped to blend ethanol into its fuels forcing it to purchase expensive credits on the open market to meet its obligations under the federal Renewable Fuels Standard. The price of those credits had soared by 2017 creating a crushing financial burden.

Facing a city unnerved by the refinery's public safety risks and immense greenhouse gas emissions a shaky financial outlook and tepid interest from investors proponents of keeping the refinery going found themselves overshadowed by a large coalition of groups looking to turn the page.

""This is a phenomenon we are seeing around the country"" said Cary Coglianese director of the program on regulation at Penn Law. ""Neighborhoods are growing up around these facilities. There are lots of people who are not benefiting from the jobs they bring but are suffering the risks associated with them. It changes the political playing field dramatically.""

Perez who is based in Chicago vividly recalls the day one of his colleagues approached him with the idea of buying the refinery. It struck him as absurd knowing the cleanup would cost hundreds of millions of dollars the environmental liabilities are immense and it would take years to tear down the thicket of pipes and heavy equipment.

""I said 'We are not buying a refinery' "" Perez said. ""I don't even need to see it.""

But Perez was lured out and on his visit he was struck to find the property just down the road from the airport close to downtown Philadelphia and right by the port. It struck him that the highest and best use for such a strategically located piece of land in a city serious about going green was no longer petroleum processing.

""The community was very excited by our commitment to taking the refinery offline"" said Perez whose company bought the property for $252 million. ""Within day one of closing we started the endeavor of unwinding 150 years worth of refining operations here.""

In South Korea more than 30000 cases of filming with hidden cameras were reported to the police between 2013 and 2018 according to the New York-based non-profit organization Human Rights Watch. The number of hidden spy camera reports has proliferated because of the increasing accessibility and inexpensiveness of such cameras combined with the public's growing ability to detect them said Kenneth Bombace CEO of intelligence firm Global Threat Solutions. Experts share simple methods to locate hidden spy cameras in hotel rooms and rental properties.

1. Conduct a physical search

When looking for hidden cameras start with areas like bathrooms and bedrooms Bombace said. Airbnb hosts are allowed to have cameras in their houses but they must inform guests and the cameras must not be placed in private spaces he said.

Almost all covert cameras are concealed in household devices such as lights thermostats and plugged clock radios Bombace said. ""Look and see if anything looks like it's out of the ordinary and then inspect it closer"" he said. Most spy cameras are connected to an electrical source or an electronic device Bombace added. He said the first thing he does in a bedroom is unplug the clock radios and put them in a drawer. Michael O'Rourke CEO of security consulting firm Advanced Operational Concepts also said he does exactly that. Even well-hidden cameras will have a small amount of reflective glass from the lens Bombace said. ""If you use flashlights and shine them on something you think could possibly hide the camera you will see a reflection in there which is a pretty good way of detecting if there's a camera"" he said.

Even when a camera is hidden in another device like a thermostat or an outlet there will be some glass in there that is reflective because there will be a lens Bombace said.

But O'Rourke said care is needed to accurately locate hidden lenses. ""A lot of people will try to do amateur lens detection which can work"" O'Rourke said. ""However if you don't have a good search methodology — if you go too fast if you're impatient — you can miss quite a bit.""

2. Look at the Wi-Fi network

A hidden camera must be connected to a local Wi-Fi network in order to be viewed remotely Bombace said.

Wi-Fi scanning apps like Fing can identify devices on the network that are cameras he said. Those who hide cameras might use a separate Wi-Fi network to stream live video footage but Wi-Fi scanning apps can also detect how many networks are in a residence Bombace said. But Kody Kinzie a security researcher at data security and analytics firm Varonis warned that a network scanner may not catch everything. ""The next thing you can do is look for devices that are broadcasting their own network name"" he said. He recommended using apps like WiGLE to find devices that are ""broadcasting some sort of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi network name"" Kinzie added.

3. Buy a spy camera detector

If all else fails spy camera detectors can scan for radio frequencies connected to hidden cameras. These can be easily bought online from websites like Amazon or AliExpress. But O'Rourke noted this method works only if the hidden camera is transmitting data. ""So many of them now have SD cards that just store data to be retrieved after someone leaves"" O'Rourke said. ""And so these are much more difficult to detect."" Bombace added that while it is possible to buy a radio frequency scanner the cheaper ones are probably not that good. ""Like anything else you get what you pay for — if it's $30 it's probably not that good"" Bombace said. ""Better ones are going to cost hundreds or even over $1000.""

What to do if you find a camera

After locating a camera immediately disconnect it without damaging it because the camera's firmware may contain identifying information such as login credentials and the Wi-Fi network it was connected to Kinzie said.

Disconnect hidden cameras but don't damage them said Varonis security researcher Kody Kinzie.

Mr. Yuthasak Supasorn TAT Governor said “TAT is going all out to showcase the wonderful possibilities Thailand offers for the ideal Indian wedding. Destinations like Krabi HuaHin Rayong Pattaya Phuket and Koh Samui are already popular with Indian wedding couples and honeymooners and this roadshow was a valuable platform from which to help us further grow this segment.”

Gracing the event in New Delhi was H.E. Pattarat Hongthong Ambassador of Thailand to India and in Mumbai Mr. Donnawit Poolsawat Consul General of the Royal Thai Consulate-General Mumbai.





Ms. Cholada Siddhivarn Director of TAT Mumbai Office said “The Amazing Thailand Wedding Summit 2022 was the perfect medium to gauge the sentiments of the Indian wedding segment especially post-pandemic.

Mastercard has successfully secured accreditation under the Australian Government’s Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) as an identity provider for identity proofing level 1+ identity exchange and credential provider. In doing so Mastercard has become the first private sector organization or entity to be accredited for more than two roles since the framework’s inception.

The TDIF sets the standards rules and guidelines for digital identity providers based on international best practice and industry standards. Accreditation demonstrates that Mastercard’s digital identity service ID is trusted safe and built to the standards set by the Australian Government. It will also support Mastercard to partner with local businesses to provide seamless secure and convenient identity verification in Australia.

Accreditation for identity proofing levels up to 1+ means users will need only an email address or mobile phone number to prove their identity. For some services they may also need an acceptable identity document which includes full name and date of birth. Once accredited providers need to continually demonstrate they meet their TDIF obligations by undergoing annual assessments.

“As many parts of the world begin to return to a sense of normality with reopening of omnichannel retail and borders the need for more effective and streamlined identity verification has never been so important. Australia is leading the way when it comes to this step change and Mastercard is excited to continue its collaboration with the public and private sector to build a national identity ecosystem where citizens have trust and confidence that their personal information is safe and secure” said Mallika Sathi Head of Cyber & Intelligence Solutions and Digital Identity Australasia Mastercard.

Mastercard has been accredited under three out of four roles supported by the TDIF:

Identity provider: providers can create maintain or manage information about a person’s identity and offer identity-based services.

Identity exchange: exchanges convey manage and coordinate the flow of identity attributes and assertions between members (identity providers credential providers attribute providers and relying parties) of an identity federation.

Credential provider: providers can generate bind and distribute credentials to individuals or can bind and manage credentials generated by individuals.

Leveraging Mastercard’s global network and data privacy practices ID offers a highly secure end-to-end solution for creating managing and verifying identities digitally. Using data encryption and biometric authentication to protect personal identity information it keeps consumers in control of their data enabling them to choose what information to provide to which organizations and when.

Mastercard has been scaling ID in Australia since 2019 announcing pilots with Deakin University and Australia Post and global partnerships with Samsung and Microsoft. In the past twelve months Mastercard has successfully partnered with Optus to roll out a pilot across sales and customer support channels.

“Digital identity not only has the potential to vastly improve the consumer experience but also provide organizations with additional peace of mind when it comes to customer onboarding and relationship management. What’s more its potential is global in scale – enabling citizens to create one identity that can be used with partners in Mastercard’s ID network anywhere in the world. That is the end goal” concludes Sathi.

Mastercard will continue to roll out ID in other industries across Australia over the coming months helping business solve real-world problems including reducing fraud and identity theft while improving the consumer experience.

Both organisations made this known at the ‘The Agribusiness Investment Forum” organized by Innovative Youth in Agriculture (I-Youth).

Speaking at the event the deputy director-general Corporate Services IITA Hilde Koper said though the institute had done a lot in scaling technologies and innovations while providing the much-needed capacity the knowledge and skills required to attract youth participation in agriculture there was support from investors to help retain their interest in the sector.

While singling out Mastercard Foundation for providing necessary funding for agribusiness training Koper stated that it had become significant for the private sector to come in by offering loans or microcredit to youth-led enterprises to scale their businesses.

She stressed that successful youth-led agribusinesses are also a viable employment opportunity for Nigerian youths.

The country head Mastercard Foundation-Nigeria Chidinma Lawanson said the foundation aimed at leveraging the youth population in Africa to deliver on the target of providing seven million dignified and fulfilling jobs in the agricultural sector noting that IITA is a strategic partner in the realization of this overall objective.

“We remain committed to working with IITA to train the youth to have linkages to financial services and work opportunities. Also create that access to market to ensure that there are no goods lost by evaluating the entire value chain from production to micro processing warehousing etc. and IITA has been a strong partner in achieving this” she said.

Executive Manager I-Youth Project Aline Mugisho stated that the institute had assisted in providing the capacity for the youth to become innovation and technology catalysts but lacks the necessary support to bring their ideas to life.

Also speaking the director Agribusiness Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture Aramide Ganzallo who represented the Commissioner for Agriculture Mrs Abisola Olusanya expressed appreciation to IITA and Mastercard Foundation for their commitment to making agriculture attractive to the youth. Ganzallo noted that the Lagos State government would continue to do its best to prioritize the youth by harnessing their potential for the growth of the agricultural sector in Nigeria.

With the victory the USA puts itself in prime position to win tournament title in its final match which will be against the Netherlands on June 28. The USA needs a win or a tie against the Dutch to lift the trophy and can even take first place with a loss depending on the result of the France-Mexico game. The USA and Netherlands will also face each other in group play at the 2022 FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup in August.

All the matches are being played in Aubagne which is located 12 miles east of Marseille in the south of France.

The USA and Mexico met on March 12 in the title game of the 2022 Concacaf Women’s U-20 Championship a 2-0 win for the USA and the USA got a strong defensive effort once again in today’s match.

The Americans opened the scoring in the 15th minute after a shot from Ayo Oke bounced off a defender and fell to Albert in the right side of the penalty box. Albert shot high from a tight angle and the ball deflected off the tips of the Mexican goalkeeper’s gloves and into the roof of the net. It was her first international goal at the U-20 level.

The match stayed tight until the 80th minute when Byars who scored twice in the USA’s 3-1 win over France on June 24 maneuvered through three Mexican defenders to slot the ball low into the right corner.

The USA clinched the match in the 86th minute off a nice sequence of possession with midfielder Alexis Missimo receiving the ball at the top of the penalty box. She then scooped a pass over two Mexican defenders to Shaw who took a touch before nutmegging the ‘keeper. It was Shaw’s second career international goal at the U-20 level.

The matches in the Sud Ladies’ Cup will be the final ones for the U.S. U-20s before head coach Tracey Kevins selects a roster for the 2022 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup to be staged from Aug. 10-28 in Costa Rica. All four teams participating in the Sud Ladies Cup have earned berths to Costa Rica.

Wade corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees — and in some cases their dependents — seeking abortions in states that outlaw the procedure.

The court's decision to roll back the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling which protected the federal constitutional right to an abortion is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America leaving abortion policy up to individual states and paving the way for numerous states to pass new abortion restrictions. As of Friday afternoon state officials in at least seven states said that new abortion bans can now be enforced.

Millions of people seeking abortions could soon be forced to travel across state lines to access the procedure adding to the cost of an already often expensive healthcare service. For many employers' benefit packages may be the only way they can afford an abortion.

In response corporations some with headquarters or offices in Republican-controlled states are taking action. Companies such as Citigroup Salesforce and Match Group first promised financial support to employees seeking abortions in affected states after a draft version of the opinion leaked in May. Many more followed suit on Friday. Some including Bumble and Lyft also previously said they would donate to organizations that support women's rights such as Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice.

Corporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent and worry about the impact these states' anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.

Here are some of the prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.

Microsoft

Microsoft extended its financial support for ""critical healthcare"" including abortions and gender-affirming care to include coverage for travel expenses for such services after the draft opinion overturning Roe was first leaked.

Apple

The company's existing benefits package allows employees to travel out of state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state according to an Apple spokesperson.

Meta

The tech giant intends to offer travel expense reimbursement ""to the extent permitted by law"" for employees seeking out-of-state health care and reproductive services according to a spokesperson. ""We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved"" the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

Yelp

Yelp's existing healthcare plan for U.S. employees pays for women family members and partners to travel out of states with strict abortion laws such as Texas and Oklahoma which ban abortions after 6 weeks.

""This ruling puts women's health in jeopardy denies them their human rights and threatens to dismantle the progress we've made toward gender equality in the workplaces since Roe"" Jeremy Stoppelman co-founder of Yelp said in a statement Friday. ""Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.""

Disney

Disney employees who are unable to access medical care in one location will be given affordable coverage to access the same care in another location according to a company spokesperson. The benefit covers family planning and pregnancy-related decisions.

Uber

Uber's U.S. insurance plans already cover reproductive health benefits including abortion and travel expenses to access healthcare. The rideshare company will also reimburse any drivers sued under state law for providing transportation to a clinic through the app according to an Uber spokesperson.

Netflix

The streaming company offers travel reimbursement coverage for U.S. full-time employees and their dependents who need to travel for healthcare treatments including abortions and gender-affirming care a Netflix spokesperson told CNN. The company provides a lifetime allowance of $10000 per employee (or their dependents) per service.

Bumble

Bumble a female-driven dating app said Friday that it will support its employees' ability to access ""the healthcare services they need"" including abortion care. A Bumble spokesperson added that the company will donate to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

""Abortion is healthcare and healthcare is a human right. We are deeply troubled by the Supreme Court decision"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Match Group

Dating app company Match Group in October established a partnership with Planned Parenthood Los Angeles to provide abortion access for its Texas employees and their dependents. The company is currently considering expanding that benefit to all its U.S. staff including remote employees in states with trigger laws that may soon ban abortions according to a Match spokesperson. Match healthcare plans also help to cover travel and lodging costs for employees who need to travel to receive care the spokesperson said.

Box.com

Box.com will cover employee travel and medical expenses incurred by employees while seeking reproductive services.

Levi Strauss

The denim company said through The Levi Strauss Foundation that it is providing grants to the Center for Reproductive Rights Afiya Center and ARC-Southeast which provides direct assistance to women and communities in need of care. The company previously said that under its benefits plan employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren't included in the company's benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement it said.

Comcast-NBC Universal

Comcast has an existing healthcare travel benefit for all employees that covers up to $4000 per trip up to three trips per year with a maximum coverage cap of $10000 per year. The amount paid out depends on the type of health care procedure but abortion care is covered according to the company.

Warner Bros Discovery

Warner Brothers Discovery which owns CNN on Friday expanded healthcare benefits options to include expenses for employees and their covered family members who need to travel to access abortions and other reproductive care according to a company spokesperson.

Condé Nast

The media company said Friday it will reimburse travel and lodging for employees who need abortion infertility or gender-reaffirming services and cannot obtain them locally. CEO Roger Lynch said in an internal memo the Supreme Court decision was a ""crushing blow to reproductive rights"" and said the most powerful way the company can respond is through its content and journalism.

JPMorgan Chase

JPMorgan on Friday said that its health care benefits have long covered abortion care. And starting in July abortion will be included in the company's health care travel benefit that covers services that can only be obtained far from home according to spokesperson Joseph Evangelisti.

Nike

The sportswear company said in a statement that it covers travel and lodging expenses in situations where healthcare services are not available close to home according to a statement Nike released Friday.

""No matter where our teammates are on their family planning journey — from contraception and abortion coverage to pregnancy and family-building support through fertility surrogacy and adoption benefits — we are here to support their decisions"" the statement reads.

Starbucks

The coffee company is providing employees enrolled in its healthcare plan a medical travel benefit to access an abortion according to a public letter to employees by Sara Kelly Starbucks acting executive vice president of partner resources.

""We all need to process this in our own way and as you do here is what I want you to know: no matter where you live or what you believe we will always ensure you have access to quality healthcare"" Kelly said in the letter.

Dick's Sporting Goods

For employees who live in a state that restricts abortion access Dick's will provide up to $4000 in travel expense reimbursement to travel to the nearest location where care is legally available the company said in a statement Friday. The benefit will be provided to any employee spouse or dependent enrolled in its medical plan along with one support person.

Kroger

The grocer's healthcare package includes travel benefits of up to $4000 to facilitate access for reproductive healthcare services including abortion and fertility treatments according to a Kroger spokesperson.

Alaska Airlines

Alaska Airlines said in a statement that it has always provided travel reimbursements for ""certain medical procedures and treatments if they are not available where you live.""

""Today's Supreme Court decision does not change that"" it said.

Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs on Friday extended its healthcare travel reimbursement policies to include all medical procedures treatments and evaluations including abortion services in areas where a provider is not available near to where its employees live a benefit that will be effective July 1 according to an internal memo obtained by CNN.

Zillow

Zillow said in a statement Friday that its health benefits cover a wide range of reproductive health services including abortions. The company said that as of June 1 its health plan has been updated to include a reimbursement of up to $7500 ""each time significant travel is necessary to access health care including reproductive services.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vc3RpcHVsYXRpb24tYWRkZWQtdG8tYWV3LXgtbmpwdy1mb3JiaWRkZW4tZG9vci1zaXgtbWFuLXRhZy10ZWFtLW1hdGNoLWNocmlzLWplcmljaG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stipulation Added To AEW x NJPW Forbidden Door Six Man Tag Team Match,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vc3RpcHVsYXRpb24tYWRkZWQtdG8tYWV3LXgtbmpwdy1mb3JiaWRkZW4tZG9vci1zaXgtbWFuLXRhZy10ZWFtLW1hdGNoLWNocmlzLWplcmljaG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpdmVtZXNwb3J0LmNvbS84ODAyNjE5OC1tb3N0LWNvbnRyb3ZlcnNpYWwtd29ybGQtY3VwLWdhbWUtdGhlLWRpc2dyYWNlLW9mLWdpam9uLXJlbWVtYmVyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most controversial World Cup game?

The semi-final was against another Esports heavyweight: Celtic were seeded by virtue of their group stagevictory. Again Sánchez started for FC Bayern and beat his Scottish rivals 2-1. In the second match Mestre suffered FC Bayern's first defeat in the knockout rounds a 2-1 reverse so a third game was needed to decide the outcome.

And Alguacil who had lost all three of his games in the group stage emerged as the match-winner for FC Bayern. Kingsley Coman (13) scored the opening goal which was cancelled out by Daizen Maeda in the 32nd minute after a goalkeeping error. Robert Lewandowski (48) restored the lead at the start of the second half to put FCB 2-1 up and the 23-year-old Alguacil then held his nerve and paved the way for FC Bayern Esports to reach the eFootball Championship Pro 2022 final.

(NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP via Getty Images)

Dave McCormick forged a relationship with Ray Dalio the founder of Bridgewater Associates in early 2008 and was rewarded with a job at Bridgewater after Dalio made $780 million on the financial collapse.

Much like his upbringing Dave McCormick the Republican challenger for US Senate in Pennsylvania can attribute his wealth and his career as the president and CEO of the world’s largest hedge fund to being in the right place at the right time.

McCormick served as the president of Bridgewater Associates the world’s largest hedge fund from 2009 when working Pennsylvanians were reeling from the financial collapse to 2020 and served as its CEO from 2020 to 2022.

A recent book titled “The Fund” by Rob Copeland is a biography that focuses on Ray Dalio’s rise as the founder of Bridgewater Associates.

It also shines a spotlight on how McCormick got rich thanks to the proverbial revolving door and his friendship with Dalio while he was serving as the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs in 2008.

“When you look at something like the recession where millions and millions of people lost their pensions or were severely hurt millions lost their jobs and to hear that someone benefited during that time it’s heartbreaking” Darrin Kelly President of the Allegheny/Fayette County Labor Council said in in an interview.

McCormick began working under former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2007 and went to Bridgewater Associates in 2009.

During this time Copeland explained in his book that McCormick met with Dalio multiple times in early 2008 when Dalio predicted an impending financial crisis and at these meetings Dalio was encouraging McCormick and other officials from former President George W. Bush’s administration and the Treasury to print money in order to stave off a financial crisis.

Once the great recession started the federal government would heed Dalio’s advice and print trillions of dollars throughout the end of 2008.

According to Copeland Dalio was betting against the dollar by investing in gold treasury bonds and commodities as the government was pumping trillions of dollars into the struggling economy in the fall of 2008.

“While Bridgewater’s automated trading systems were positioned relatively conservatively in 2007 and 2008 Dalio himself ordered a number of manual adjustments so the fund would profit more heavily from an overall decline investment staffers there then recall. Throughout this period he had placed a series of bets that would pay off if central bankers printed money to revive the economy—the exact move he had predicted” Copeland wrote in the book.

Dalio made $780 million dollars in 2008 as Bridgewater Associates’ Alpha fund saw a 9% increase. Other hedge funds were witnessing 20% losses during that time.

Dalio then rewarded McCormick by hiring him as Bridgewater Associates’ president in 2009. McCormick would then go on to earn $21 million in 2021 as the hedge fund’s CEO.

To put things into perspective over 191000 Pennsylvanians lost their jobs in 2008 and 2009 and the state’s unemployment rate peaked at 9.3% in October 2010. Home foreclosures in the state skyrocketed by 173% during that time and over 44000 properties were foreclosed on in 2009.

All of this happened while McCormick began working at Bridgewater Associates.

“You look at it right now there are still pension funds that have not gotten fully back. There are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of union members whose pensions were literally wiped out or were taken to the point where they’re still not back. People are still struggling from that day” Kelly said.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 2022 that McCormick and his wife Dina Powell a Goldman Sachs executive are worth between $116 million to $290 million and possibly more.

McCormick lived in Connecticut while working for Bridgewater and the Associated Press reported that he rents a $16 million mansion on Connecticut’s “Gold Coast” one of the densest concentrations of wealth in the country. The mansion includes a 1500-bottle wine cellar an elevator and a private beachfront resort overlooking the Long Island Sound.

McCormick’s wealth and lavish lifestyle are already focal points in his upcoming campaign against US Sen. Bob Casey.

Casey is campaigning on a progressive economic platform that includes supporting unions going after junk fees and going after corporations for price gouging during and after the pandemic.

Casey is also using his opponents out of state residence and wealth whenever he gets a chance to on the campaign trail.

“He doesn’t live in Pennsylvania. He lied about living in Pennsylvania. We know that and he continues to try to make that case that he’s living here” Casey said to supporters in Lancaster last month.

“So here’s a candidate who’s an out-of-state candidate being supported by out of state billionaires. We don’t want a senator like that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9jaGFkLXJldXRlci1iZWxpZXZlcy1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stY2FuLWNvbXBldGUtZm9yLXN0YXJ0ZXItc25hcHMtYXMtcm9va2llL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chad Reuter Believes Mason McCormick Can Compete For Starter Snaps As Rookie,"The Pittsburgh Steelers made it an emphasis to improve their offensive line in the 2024 NFL Draft selecting Troy Fautanu Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick with three of their first five selections. While Fautanu and Frazier seem likely to start on Day 1 or at least early in the season McCormick to this point has been viewed more as depth across the interior offensive line. However NFL Media draft analyst Chad Reuter believes McCormick could potentially take over a starting spot at guard for the Steelers and believes the three rookie starters might be an improvement over last season’s offensive line.

“McCormick has the toughness and athleticism to take a starting spot from James Daniels or Isaac Seumalo. Yes that potentially means the Steelers would start three rookies on the offensive line but some Steelers fans might argue McCormick left tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier will quickly constitute an improvement over last year’s group despite their lack of experience.”

I find it very very hard to believe that the Steelers would bench one of Seumalo or Daniels for McCormick. While there were some down moments for the most part the two were steady last season and among Pittsburgh’s best offensive linemen. Seumalo in particular brings leadership to a line that will still be very young and it’s really hard to fathom McCormick getting starter reps as a rookie.

Now could he compete with Nate Herbig for the top backup job at guard and potentially win it? Sure but even then McCormick is likely waiting for an injury to get his reps. The more realistic scenario here is that McCormick serves as depth and potentially as the team’s backup center behind Frazier as they worked him out at the position before the draft and he becomes a viable starting option after 2024 when Daniels’ contract will be up. The guard market got expensive in free agency this offseason and Daniels might be looking at a number the Steelers don’t want to pay. McCormick becomes insurance against them overpaying to keep Daniels around should he want a lot of money.

The selection of McCormick was an awesome one to help bolster Pittsburgh’s line depth and add a bully on the offensive line and it’s continually been praised since the draft concluded. But given what the Steelers currently have at guard it’s just hard to fathom the team benching two experienced starters who have been good in Seumalo and Daniels for McCormick. That doesn’t mean McCormick won’t one day be a starter but I’d be shocked if it happened in 2024 without injuries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhZ2xlY291bnRyeW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2JyYXVuLXdpbnMtZ29wLXByaW1hcnktam9pbnMtbWNjb3JtaWNrLWluLXJhY2UtZm9yLWdvdmVybm9yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Braun Wins GOP Primary Joins McCormick in Race for Governor,"Jennifer McCormick was unopposed in the Democratic primary.

MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd29ya3dlZWsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMjUvbWNkb25hbGRzLTQyYi1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS1lbXBpcmUtZXhwbGFpbmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's $42B real estate empire explained -,"In the fallout from Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine McDonald’s officially exited the Russian market in May.

Per CNN the burger chain sold 850 restaurants — which employs 62k people — to the local franchisee a Siberian oil tycoon (McDonald’s says it’ll take a $1.4B charge against its earnings for the deal).

The English translation of the company’s new name is straight to the point: “Tasty and That’s It” (the new logo is still in the shape of an “M” and apparently is supposed to look like a burger and two fries).

McDonald’s arrival in Moscow on January 31st 1990 was one of the most iconic moments in fast-food history. It happened near the end of the Cold War and signified an opening of Russia to the West (the restaurant had 30k+ visited on the first day).

The Moscow location has two general lessons for the McDonald’s business:

Control of franchisees: When McDonald’s entered Russia the Communist country did not have “private businesses to supply the 300 or so distinct ingredients needed by a McDonald’s outlet” per NYT. So McDonald’s built a $50m factory outside of Moscow (appropriately called The McComplex) to supply the buns lettuce frozen fries beef etc. McDonald’s wouldn’t completely outsource its Russia supply chain until 2010 (the existence of this in-country supply chain is actually one reason that the current franchisee was able to easily take over the brand).

When McDonald’s entered Russia the Communist country did not have “private businesses to supply the 300 or so distinct ingredients needed by a McDonald’s outlet” per NYT. So McDonald’s built a $50m factory outside of Moscow (appropriately called The McComplex) to supply the buns lettuce frozen fries beef etc. McDonald’s wouldn’t completely outsource its Russia supply chain until 2010 (the existence of this in-country supply chain is actually one reason that the current franchisee was able to easily take over the brand). Real estate deals: In the late 1980s Russia was so keen to get McDonald’s into the country that it agreed to a wild deal. It took 14 years to negotiate but McDonald’s was able to secure the first Moscow location for 1 ruble per square meter a year. Here’s the kicker: the lease was for 49 years! And — over the years — attempts to renegotiate it repeatedly failed.

McDonald’s Russia business was not lucrative in the early years as the country was quite poor. While prices for a meal were 50% less that in the United States it still amounted to a half day’s wage.

The deal was still worth it for McDonald’s. Why? Because of the real estate perks. In 1993 McDonald’s opened a $15m downtown office (appropriately called McDonald’s Tower) that it co-owned with the Moscow City Council.

The fast food chain leased the space to other Western corporations (Coca-Cola Amex Toyota) trying to break into the Russian market.

The cliche “McDonald’s is a real estate company” was quite literal in the early Moscow days.

Today McDonald’s real estate holding is worth $42B and 36% of its $23B in revenue is from franchisees paying rents.

Let’s break down the business.

There are currently 40k+ McDonald’s restaurants in 110+ countries (based on crude estimates I’ve eaten at 15876 of them).

Among these stores McDonald’s owns:

55% of LAND under the locations (+ long-term leases for the rest)

80% of buildings

McDonald’s $42B real estate holdings are ~80% of total assets and can be thought of like apartment buildings that collect rent.

The McDonald’s story is most associated with Ray Croc who had a contentious relationship with the founding McDonald’s brothers (TLDR: Croc partnered with them on the chain but ended up booting them out in a sketchy manner).

However it was Harry J. Sonneborn — McDonald’s President from 1955-1967 — who created the lucrative real estate model for the fast food chain.

Croc’s initial model extracted money from franchisees by:

Charging an initial franchise fee

Escalating royalty payments

Selling them marked-up supplies

Unhappy franchisees could balk at the demands. So Sonneborn pitched a way for more control: become a landlord.

To build the real estate business Croc and Sonneborn — played by Michael Keaton and BJ Novak in the pretty damn good 2016 biopic The Founder — launched McDonald’s Franchise Realty Corp in 1956.

Soon they started buying real estate and leasing it to franchisees at a 40% markup.

Here was the control catch: if franchisees ignored McDonald’s guidance they were breaking the lease and could be evicted.

This is how Sonneborn explained the arrangement to Wall Street investors:

“We are not…in the food business. We are in the real estate business. The only reason we sell $0.15 burgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue from which our tenants can pay us rent.”

While Kroc disliked Sonneborn’s blunt framing the model remains true to this day.

In 2021 McDonald’s made $13.1B in revenue from franchisees. Rent was 64% ($8.4B) and Royalties was 36% ($4.6B) of that figure.

At the individual level 8-15% of franchisee sales go to rent.

Overall McDonald’s made $23B in 2021 split between:

Franchisee-run stores (57% of sales)

Company-run stores (43% of sales)

Add it all up and rent accounts for 35% of McDonald’s TOTAL revenue.

The Franchise model is much more profitable for McDonald’s with 82% operating margins (vs. 18% for company-owned stores which the chain has to run itself).

Unsurprisingly McDonald’s weights its stores towards high-margin franchisees which account for 93% of its 40k+ locations.

McDonald’s uses company-owned locations to test new ideas/products before rolling them out to franchisees which typically sign 20-year lease agreements.

To identify good real estate locations McDonald’s uses traffic analysis walking patterns and census data.

An ideal location has:

50k+ sqft

Corner or corner wrap with signage on two major streets.

Signalized intersection

Build height of 23ft

Parking lot potential

Here is the model’s secret sauce: McDonald’s typically finances the property at a fixed rate but — because royalties are 4% of sales (+ a fee for ads) — its take from franchisees are variable.

As sales and prices rise (*cough* inflation *cough*) McDonald’s captures sales upside while its largest financial outlay is fixed.

In the early-2010s investors were clamouring for McDonald’s to spin off its real estate biz into a REIT (real estate investment trust).

In 2015 McDonald’s decided against the REIT in part because the deal was too complicated (including changes to the tax code that made such a spin-off less advantageous).



But the real reason is probably that Sonnebon’s model is just too good of a business…as elegantly explained by this Wall Street Bets post:

A viral fast food thread: On a related note here’s a former Wendy’s pricing manager breaks (what a baller job) breaking down the economics of a single fast food store. Some hi-lights from the Twitter thread:

30/30/30 rule : Successful stores aim for a cost breakdown of 30% wages / 30% site costs (utilities rent maintenance) / 30% food costs. The remaining 10% is for profits and franchise fees.

: Successful stores aim for a cost breakdown of 30% wages / 30% site costs (utilities rent maintenance) / 30% food costs. The remaining 10% is for profits and franchise fees. The most profitable items: …are drinks and fries. Sandwiches have the most food cost and you’d quickly go out of business only selling those.

…are drinks and fries. Sandwiches have the most food cost and you’d quickly go out of business only selling those. Ground beef: Major fast-food chains do not get ground beef at a lower cost than regular shoppers (even with high volumes). Why? Ground beef is usually a loss-leader for supermarkets so prices are already low across the board.

Advertising hacks: A wild YouTube video that shows how fast-food chains make their products look “good” for TV. Example: motor oil is drizzled on top of pancakes instead of syrup (Why? the pancakes don’t absorb the syrup and look fluffier).

Dr. Seuss: I’ve read my son Dr. Seuss books for years. For some reason the “That Sam I Am” character from Green Eggs & Ham puts my kid into stitches. Anyways I recently discovered the wild origin story behind the book (and it’s confirmed by Snopes):

Green Eggs and Ham was born out of a $50 wager between Dr. Seuss and his publisher Bennett Cerf who bet he couldn’t write an articulate entertaining book using only fifty different words. The result was a 62-page volume composed of 49 monosyllabic words and a fiftieth three-syllable word “anywhere.”

THE POWER OF CONSTRAINTS! (Side note: While Googling this story I came by some highly inappropriate — but hilarious — fake Dr. Seuss book covers)

Just last week a new spokesperson for McDonald’s appeared in Japan. Usually this wouldn’t be much cause for concern but this new spokesperson wasn’t a friendly face — in fact it wasn’t the face of a human at all. Instead it was the helmeted face of one of the world’s most famous anime antagonists – Char Aznable from the mecha anime Mobile Suit Gundam!

▼ Here he is fronting up for the new series of Gundam burgers with this one playing up the spiciness of the Char Custom Kara Dabuchi.

While the entire four-burger series includes a Char Custom Dabuchi Sausage Muffin only available on the morning menu when our Gundam-loving reporter Egawa Tasuku stopped by to try the burgers at lunch there were three to choose from.

▼ Left to right: Red Garlic Teriyaki Kara Dabuchi and Newtype White Torichi

Seeing as Egawa had previously tried the Kara Dabuchi when it appeared on the menu for a limited time last year he was keen to try the “New” burgers which were making their debut at McDonald’s for the first time. So he ordered the Teriyaki and the Torichi along with a Red Energy Flavour McFizz and took them home for a taste test.

▼ Lovin’ it.

Like Char himself who’s known for fighting in custom versions of standard mobile suits featured in the anime these burgers have been equally enhanced. Taking them out of the bag revealed they were decked out in Char Custom mobile suits of their own — Zeong for the Newtype White Torichi (left) and the Char Custom Gelgoog for the Red Garlic Teriyaki (right).

Starting with the Newtype White Torichi Egawa stopped for a moment to gaze at the beauty of the packaging.

Inside this mobile suit was the white triple cheeseburger oozing with white cheddar cheese which reminded Egawa of the colour associated with series protagonist Amuro Ray. It was heavy and delicious but if this were a battle Amuro would probably want to curl up for a nap after eating a burger like this rather than head into battle with Char.

▼ Next up to the tasting dock we have the Char Custom Red Garlic Teriyaki.

This new burger sits inside the Gelgoog the mobile suit Char piloted before Zeong. As a nod to Char’s favourite colour and his nickname “The Red Comet” red plays a big role here featuring in the spicy sauce and colouring the burger buns.

The specs for this burger are built upon a teriyaki base model and include smoked bacon and garlic soy sauce mayonnaise.

This was a deliciously smoky saucy encounter and it delivered such a wallop of spice to the taste buds that Egawa was glad he’d bought the red McFizz. This fizzy beverage helped to douse the heat and sweeten the climax with honey and guarana berries.

Everything Egawa tasted made an impact and left him feeling happy and satisfied much like a Gundam episode although this new series will be coming to a conclusion soon as it’s only on the menu until the end of July.

Before the series wraps up Egawa hopes to order all the burgers and head out to the life-size statue of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam in Tokyo the RX-78-2 Gundam in Yokohama and the RX-93 ν (“Nu”) Gundam in Fukuoka to really blur the lines between fast food and fiction!

On Monday McDonald’s warned Australians should be prepared to get some chicken nuggets with the new sauces being released this week.

The ""fan favourite"" Cajun sauce will return this July along with the Australian debut of the Szechuan Sauce.

In a media release McDonald’s said the Cajun sauce is a blend of Dijon mustard vinegar honey and spices which make for a ""creamy sweet yet tangy flavour"".

""This fan favourite sold out the last time it was released in 2020 so you’d better be quick"" McDonald's said.

The Szechuan Sauce boasts an aromatic and rich blend of soy sauce ginger garlic and sesame oil.

""We know how much Macca’s fans love our Chicken McNuggets and sauces and we can’t wait to release a limited stock of some our highly requested sauces like Szechuan and Cajun sauces"" McDonald’s Marketing Director Tim Kenward said.

The sauces will be available from Wednesday July 6 until Tuesday July 19 while stocks last at McDonald's restaurants nationwide.

Details about the other two dipping sauces are yet to be announced.

While the sauces aren't set to launch for another week Macca's ""superfans"" will have a chance to get their hands on their own supply of the sauces before they hit restaurants.

Fans will have a chance to embark on a three-day digital sauce hunt to claim the prize.

Starting on Tuesday June 28 at 9am people taking part in the Sauce Quest will have to solve clues and find hidden sauce splatters.

If you find all the splatters you will go in the draw to win a personal stash of the Cajun and Szechaun sauces.

“Keep an eye on Macca’s socials for your first clue” Mr Kenward said.

On Monday Gossamer and the Italy-based Chiesi Farmaceutici announced a collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and eventually sell the drug which is called seralutinib. Gossamer has been testing seralutinib as a potential treatment for an uncommon disease known in short as PAH and is currently recruiting patients in a late-stage clinical trial meant to serve as the basis for approval applications.

PAH or pulmonary arterial hypertension is a form of high blood pressure in the lungs. The pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood over time causing the organ to weaken or even fail. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several blood vessel-widening medicines that help alleviate the symptoms of PAH and more recently cleared a first-of-its-kind therapy from Merck & Co.

Unlike other treatments Merck’s Winrevair inhibits a protein that thickens the walls of blood vessels. The therapy is injected every three weeks and is seen as a valuable product by both Wall Street and Merck which acquired it through an $11.5 billion buyout of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Analysts have predicted Winrevair could generate annual sales anywhere between $1 billion to $8 billion at its peak.

Gossamer believes there’s still room in the market for its drug as it also works differently than available treatment options and comes as an inhaled powder. Results from a smaller PAH study encouraged the company to advance seralutinib into that late-stage trial titled “Prosera” which will enroll 350 participants and complete by late 2025.

While Gossamer remains confident in its drug company investors have questioned the strength of those earlier trial results and whether seralutinib can truly compete with Winrevair. Shares of Gossamer lost three-quarters of their value in late 2022 when findings from the smaller study were announced. As of Monday morning they traded at about 75 cents apiece.

Joseph Schwartz an analyst at investment firm Leerink Partners wrote in a note to clients that the new deal with Chiesi “could address many of the concerns investors have” with Gossamer. Chief among those concerns according to Schwartz is the company’s ability to enroll and fund Prosera.

The collaboration “bodes well” for Gossamer “based on the amount of diligence that typically precedes a collaboration” the analyst wrote.

Story continues

Per deal terms Gossamer will continue leading the development of seralutinib in PAH as well as another related indication the companies are interested in: pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Though Gossamer and Chiesi will evenly split development costs the former is responsible for financing Prosera.

In the U.S. the partners plan to evenly share commercial profits and losses. Gossamer will helm commercialization efforts for those two diseases while Chiesi will take the lead for any additional indications.

Chiesi will also have the exclusive right to commercialize seralutinib outside of the U.S. Gossamer will get mid-to-high teens royalties on net sales. Chiesi has agreed to pay Gossamer $160 million as a development reimbursement and may shell out up to $326 million more provided certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved.

Zuckerberg also said in order to get more money directly to creators Meta is going going to keep paid online events fan subscriptions badges and its upcoming independent news products free for creators until 2024. The company had previously said it was going to do this until 2023.

Zuckerberg announced that Meta is testing a designated place on Instagram where creators can get discovered and paid for content. Meta notes that the creator marketplace allows brands to share new partnership opportunities. Once a brand finds a creator that they want to partner with they can send a project with the details to them including information about deliverables and payment. Meta notes that there will be a partnership messaging folder within Instagram DMs where creators and brands will be able to filter through their offers and projects.

It's worth noting that Meta's take on its marketplace for creators seems to be similar to TikTok’s Creator Marketplace which is the video app’s in-house influencer marketing platform. TikTok's Creator Marketplace allows brands to discover top TikTok personalities for their marketing campaigns which is what Meta looks to be aiming to do with its own creator marketplace. It's clear that Meta's Creator Marketplace will be part of its continued efforts to take on TikTok and woo more creators to its platform.

Meta is also launching interoperable subscriptions to let creators give their paying subscribers on other platforms access to subscriber-only Facebook Groups. The company notes that these exclusive groups are Meta's first investment in interoperable monetization tools for creators which lets creators receive payments from their fans on other platforms and offer access to exclusive features on Facebook.

As for the company's current monetization offerings Zuckerberg announced that Meta is opening up the Facebook Reels Play Bonus program to more creators on Facebook and also letting creators cross-post their Instagram Reels to Facebook and monetize them there as well. The Reels Play Bonus program is a part of Meta’s larger $1 billion creator fund.

Starting next week U.S.-based creators can apply for the Facebook Reels Play bonus program if they have created more than five Reels and have a total of at least 100000 views in the last 30 days. Creators must meet Meta's Partner Monetization Policies and Content Monetization Policies to be eligible for the program. Prior to this expansion the program was invite-only. Meta says it has received a lot of interest in the program and is now allowing people to apply to join the program.

Zuckerberg also announced that Meta is opening up Facebook Stars the virtual items that allow fans to express their support for their favorite creators to all eligible creators. Starting this week creators who have at least 1000 followers over the last 60 days will be eligible to onboard. Creators must be in a region where Stars are available and must also meet Meta's Partner Monetization Policies and Content Monetization Policies. Meta is also bringing back Stars Fest a month-long celebration from June 15 to July 15 to recognize Stars creators.

""We're heading toward a future where more people can do creative work they enjoy and I want platforms like ours to play a role in making that happen"" Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post about today's announcement.

Zuckerberg also announced that Meta is expanding its NFT test on Instagram so more creators around the world can display their NFTs on Instagram. The supported blockchains for showcasing NFTs on Instagram are Ethereum and Polygon with support for Flow and Solana coming soon.

From there Tony Stark turned the building which exists in the MCU where the MetLife Building exists in real-life into the Avengers headquarters where they lived and worked in the 2015 sequel Age of Ultron. After the superteam moved their HQ to a compound in upstate NY Avengers Tower was sold and replaced by a distinctive-looking glass-covered building first glimpsed in Spider-Man: Far From Home.

Marvel Studios

However in two New York City-based MCU projects that have been released since Far From Home there's been a noticeable goof: the visual effects team forgot to use CGI to erase the real-world MetLife Building and digitally insert the structure added in the second MCU Spider-Man film.

One of those projects was Hawkeye which was almost entirely set in Manhattan. In Episode 6 of the series a shot of the New York City skyline had the MetLife Building plainly visible.

The other of those two releases were a certain sorcery-centered sequel starring Benedict Cumberbatch.

A Notable Multiverse of Madness Continuity Error

Eagle-eyed Reddit user Electrical_Daikon771 noticed an element in the background of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness that shouldn't actually be there: the MetLife building.

During Strange and Wong's first act fight with the monster known as Gargantos visible in the distance is the famous skyscraper where what should be present is the tower featured in Spider-Man: Far From Home.

Here's a screencap from the Doctor Strange sequel showing the error:

Why the Mistake for Avengers Tower?

This isn't the first time this mistake has been made as the MetLife building was shown in Hawkeye as well. But this little snafu extends back even further.

The Marvel/Netflix series' such as Daredevil and Luke Cage (both now on Disney+) were notorious among fans for not including Avengers Tower in their numerous shows in New York City despite the idea that they were ostensibly set within the MCU.

And if someone's thinking ""What if the MetLife building was constructed after Spider-Man: Far From Home but before Hawkeye?"" It's technically possible but the established timeline doesn't really support that notion. Far From Home is set in the Summer of 2024 while Hawkeye is Christmastime of the same year roughly six or seven months later. That's not enough time to demolish the brand-new unnamed Avengers Tower replacement and construct an entirely new skyscraper in its place.

This is likely just an element of the production that got lost in the shuffle. VFX houses are currently experiencing an unprecedented backlog of work due to the pandemic so it's the little details that can sometimes be missed and understandably so.

But with Multiverse of Madness now streaming on Disney+ what's stopping the platform from going back in and rectifying this issue with a little CGI touch-up? It remains to be seen whether it will happen but it's in the realm of possibility. After all CGI alterations have previously been made to WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier long after both shows first arrived on the streaming service.

The union issued a report Friday estimating that four casinos including the Tropicana could lose $2.6 million a day in the event of a strike which has been threatened for July 1 if a new contract is not reached by then.

ATLANTIC CITY — A week before it could walk out on strike against numerous Atlantic City casinos the resort’s main casino workers union warned that a strike could cost four casinos a total of $2.6 million a day in losses.

Local 54 of the Unite Here union issued a report Friday estimating that the city’s top-performing casino the Borgata could lose $1.6 million a day in the event of a strike and that the three casinos owned by Caesars Entertainment — Caesars Harrah’s and Tropicana — could collectively lose an additional $1 million a day.

The union made its projections based on past casino revenue and earnings data reported to the state and assumed that a strike would cause revenue to decline by 25% in the third quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2021.

Contracts with Atlantic City's nine casinos expired on June 1. The union has authorized a strike against these four casinos on July 1 if a new pact is not reached by then. (It also has set a July 3 strike deadline for Hard Rock whose finances were not included in Friday's projections.)

Bob McDevitt the union’s president had no immediate comment on the report Friday. Representatives of MGM Resorts International which owns the Borgata and Caesars Entertainment which owns the other three casinos did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.

Jane Bokunewicz director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University which studies the Atlantic City casino industry said it is difficult to accurately predict the financial impact of a strike with so many variables in play. These include the number of casinos that are targeted by a strike and the public’s willingness to patronize them in such an event.

“The casino floors at all properties would remain functioning as normal because they are not part of Local 54” she said. Casinos that are struck “would use nonunion employees and management to keep the hotel and food and beverage sites operating at an acceptable level to attract customers. Revenue losses or gains would depend on how successful they are at doing this.”

As of Friday the union had reached so-called “me-too” agreements with Bally's and the Ocean Casino Resort pledging them to adopt the terms of contracts eventually reached with the larger casinos in the city. That effectively means they will not be struck the union has said.

The union report said a strike could have a particularly meaningful impact on Caesars Entertainment which got 15% of its earnings from Atlantic City in the third quarter of last year.

In 2021 Caesars’ New Jersey properties generated 33.2% of their net revenue and 42% of their gross operating profit in the third quarter the union report said.

The union also noted that the timing of a strike could be painful for the casinos coming at the start of the July Fourth weekend traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for Atlantic City's casinos.

And it would come amid an ongoing labor shortage at all nine casinos. Local 54's workers clean hotel rooms and public areas including the casino floor and restrooms and staff food and beverage operations among other responsibilities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjhuZXdzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaW1hZ2luZS1kcmFnb25zLW1lZXQtc3VyZmluLXVzYS1hdC1mb3VudGFpbnMtb2YtYmVsbGFnaW8v0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuOG5ld3Nub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9pbWFnaW5lLWRyYWdvbnMtbWVldC1zdXJmaW4tdXNhLWF0LWZvdW50YWlucy1vZi1iZWxsYWdpby9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Imagine Dragons meets ‘Surfin’ USA’ at Fountains of Bellagio,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/imagine-dragons-meet-surfin-usa-at-fountains-of-bellagio/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjhuZXdzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaW1hZ2luZS1kcmFnb25zLW1lZXQtc3VyZmluLXVzYS1hdC1mb3VudGFpbnMtb2YtYmVsbGFnaW8v0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuOG5ld3Nub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9pbWFnaW5lLWRyYWdvbnMtbWVldC1zdXJmaW4tdXNhLWF0LWZvdW50YWlucy1vZi1iZWxsYWdpby9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvaGFuZG1haWRzLXRhbGUtc2VyaWVzLXJvZS12LXdhZGUtZGVjaXNpb24tcmVhY3Rpb24td2FycmVuLWxpdHRsZWZpZWxkLTEyMzUwNTE5NTMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi9oYW5kbWFpZHMtdGFsZS1zZXJpZXMtcm9lLXYtd2FkZS1kZWNpc2lvbi1yZWFjdGlvbi13YXJyZW4tbGl0dGxlZmllbGQtMTIzNTA1MTk1My9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ EP Warren Littlefield On “Hauntingly Relevant” Dystopian Drama Finding Hope & Mobilizing After Roe V Wade Is Overturned,"Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale was filming the last two episodes of its upcoming fifth season in Toronto on Friday when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in Washington D.C. stripping American women of their constitutional right to have an abortion. As protestors gathered outside the court building some were wearing the Handmaid’s costume from the series a familiar sight over the last couple of years as the outfit has become a symbol of women’s fight to protect their reproductive rights.

“We’ve said many times over a number of years we would love to be less relevant but sadly the show’s been hauntingly relevant. And today appears even more so” Handmaid’s Tale executive producer Warren Littlefield said in an interview Friday night. “I think we all wish that we were this bizarre dystopian no-one-would-ever-believe-this concept. We all wish that we were a made-up graphic novel.”

Margaret Atwood wrote The Handmaid’s Tale more than a decade after Roe v Wade had become the law of the land as a dystopian novel that depicts a near-future New England as a patriarchal totalitarian state — known as the Republic of Gilead — where women’s reproductive rights are suppressed.

Hulu set out to develop a TV series adaptation with writer Bruce Miller during Barak Obama’s second term as President with Littlefield joining before Elisabeth Moss was cast to play the lead June Osborne. The project was picked up straight-to-series in the spring of 2016 when there was no real threat to reproductive rights on the horizon.

In November 2016 the series was filming its first season. “We all stayed up very late the night of the election where we all felt we would be celebrating the ushering in of the first female president of the United States. We thought that [The Handmaid’s Tale] was still going to be relevant and important” Littlefield recalled. “Then all of a sudden [Donald] Trump was elected and the world shifted. When we went on the air [in April 2017] it was the start of the Trump administration.”

Over the past six years leading to yesterday’s decision rendered by a conservative Supreme Court majority secured by Trump’s picks there has been a string of state legislation that restricted abortion in places such as Georgia Ohio and Texas. As women fought back donning the Handmaid costume at protests became an image of the resistance.

“It’s a tremendous source of pride to see protests throughout the country — and also protests throughout the world — where women are putting on the Handmaid’s costume the robe the bonnet and we see it become a symbol of the fight for women’s freedom and women’s rights” Littlefield said. “But today I just feel tremendous sadness anger and frustration because of who we are right now in America and what this says. Over the past number of years we’ve seen throughout the planet the rise of the far right. Unfortunately I think the United States stands the tallest and with the rise of that movement the continued restriction of women’s rights and freedom and In that way sadly we’ve separated ourselves from many other nations that are experiencing the rise of the far right.”

Along with news photos of women taking to the streets in the Handmaid’s costume images from the show have been circulating on social media including character posters from Season 2 whose messages take on a eerily dark new meaning following the Supreme Court ruling.

In the upcoming fifth season set to debut September 14 “we dip into how the right has seeped even into Canada which has been treated previously as a very sacred place; we’re showing that Gilead rises there as well” Littlefield said.

He doesn’t expect any last-minute tweaks in the last two episodes which are currently being directed by series stars Bradley Whitford (Episode 9) and Moss (the season finale).

“I suspect there won’t be because we have a pretty powerful narrative. I mean the series echoes what we’re living with today” he said.

At the time of the interview Littlefield had only been in touch with production staff in Toronto in the hours following the Roe v Wade news. “I have heard from a number of Canadians who work on the show that say ‘we are as saddened as you are and we stand with you’” he says. “So there’s been quite the connection where citizens of the world are shocked dismayed and realize that our narrative drama is closer and closer to reality and that’s wildly uncomfortable. But it also says to us that we are an important beacon and so that’s our small part in this I guess.”

Is Friday’s ruling an incentive to keep The Handmaid’s Tale going with a sixth season?

“I think from day one the quest has been to have a powerful dramatic narrative that with June taking up the fight we as an audience stand united with June and June gives us hope. Well she hasn’t given up and we can’t give up” he said. “I think it’s a powerful powerful message that despite all that June is up against in Gilead there’s a ray of hope in her fight and determinism. I think that’s valuable and important we are still relevant and so long as Bruce and the writing staff feel there’s more to tell then that’s what we’re going to do.”

Speaking of hope “today it’s very difficult to see it I can’t say that that’s an emotion I felt today” Littlefield admitted. “But I think that what’s critical is we have to find it and we can’t let go of it. So we have to mobilize we have to realize what women are going to have to go through to find services that protect them the distances they have to go. We’re going to have to build new infrastructure in the states where it’s supported fight as hard as we can and support — financially emotionally and with sweat. And so today it’s probably difficult to see any of those rays of light but we’ll uncover them. I think individually and collectively that’s what we all must do.”",,,

e-safety devices to prevent illegal fellingThe IoT-based smart sensor developed by the(IWST) to prevent the illegal felling of valuable trees is garnering attention. As per the IT cell of IWST many forest departments across the country and individual farmers have placed orders for these smart sensors. scientist IT Cell IWST said “We have a request of over one lakh microchips from theto protect deodar trees from illegal felling. We have demonstrated the functionalities and they have placed an order for one lakh microchips. Shimla experiences extreme weather conditions and thus they wanted to test the viability of the device. We are also in talks withandDepartments for installation of the device in their areas.”The sensors have been developed to ensure timely detection and prevention of illegal felling of valuable trees such as rosewood and red sanders. According to Soundararajan the technology was developed after looking at huge losses that the farmers incurred due to illegal tree felling across the country.The e-safety device works by analyzing disturbance to the tree and sounds an alarm on mobile phones of concerned authorities through an application. The device is installed on the tree by removing a portion of the bark. The microchip can communicate to a gateway which then intimates the farmer through the app within 10 to 15 seconds of the disturbance.“Areas under such plantations are huge and it is difficult for forest officials or farmers to keep an eye on every tree all the time. The application can be downloaded on multiple smartphone devices. In case of a disturbance such as a tree felling the sensor picks up the vibration and triggers an alarm” informed Soundararajan.The device consisting of a microchip can also be put inside an artificial bark made up of wood plastic composite to camouflage natural bark to ensure the device is not detectable from a distance.Currently IWST scientists are working on making the sensor more portable and economically viable.“In the first phase of development the microchip was 6.5 cm long which was reduced to 5 cm in the second phase. We are also working on the range of these sensors.While currently they can communicate with the gateway within a 5-km range the idea is to keep improving the range to avoid installation of multiple gateways forbigger farms or forest land” said Soundararajan.IWST has now reached out to the Forest and Climate Change (MOEF&CC) for funds to install a server at its campus. “We want to install the server at IWST’s data centre to avoid any snag” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(pic: Microsoft)

A reader worries that Microsoft is taking the wrong attitude with its first party studios especially Starfield developer Bethesda.

I read the Reader’s Feature about Starfield the other day and couldn’t help but agree. The gameplay footage all looked worryingly familiar despite it being a brand new franchise in a completely different universe and I have very little confidence in it turning out well. Bethesda is a good developer at least in part but their biggest problem is that they believe their own hype and my worry is that Microsoft is making that worse.

In theory Microsoft buying Bethesda could be a good thing. One of Bethesda’s biggest issues is their outdated tech and their terrible QA. Microsoft could help with both those things very easily and while I doubt there’s been enough time to do anything about the graphics for Starfield they should be helping out with the bug-checking. If Starfield comes out and it’s the usual glitchy mess though that is going to be a giant red flag.

Recently Bethesda admitted that they’re already working on Fallout 5 but at the speed they go it’ll be lucky to come out this decade given they have The Elder Scrolls 6 to finish first. Microsoft should be helping with Elder Scrolls 6 and absolutely should be involved in Fallout 5 from the very start but why is it I get the feeling they’re not?

Microsoft owns a lot of developers now but it’s going to be a long time before any of their games see the light of day. That’s understandable but some sources are already suggesting that there’s a problem with how Microsoft are managing them. The Initiative is the obvious one where Crystal Dynamics had to be brough in to help with their first game and reports saying half the staff have left recently.

A bigger concern for me though is Playground Games who have been plugging away at the Fable reboot for at least five years and yet still haven’t been able to show so much as a screenshot of it. Not even Nintendo would be that secretive and given how desperately Microsoft needs something to show off it suggests that something has gone very wrong somewhere along the long and they’re scrambling to fix it.

I’ve not seen any reports about Playground but there have been leaks for The Initiative suggesting that Microsoft has purposefully tried not to get involved and has left everyone to their own devices apparently stung by the collapse of Lionhead Studios and their other Xbox 360 era developers. I can see why they’d do that but already it sounds like they’re overcompensating and making things just as bad in the other direction. Which brings me back to Bethesda.

What needs to happen with Bethesda is for someone in charge to lay down the law about bugs and tell them to do something about their standards when it comes to graphics and other technology. No more bad animation and broken physics. What they seem to be doing though is leaving Bethesda to do things their way while simultaneously telling them they’re the best developer in the world.

The relationship sounds like doting parents mollycoddling an underachieving child whereas the relationship should be that of a firm but fair teacher. Microsoft needs to be very hands-on saving Bethesda from their worst impulses not some distant hands-off boss.

If Starfield does turn out as bad as some fear I won’t entirely blame Bethesda. Everyone needs encouragement but they also need honest critique and if Microsoft is going around all their developers telling them they’re amazing and can do whatever they like well… I’m sure you’ve all met children whose parents treat them like that and they’re unbearable.

Microsoft brings Search Highlights to Windows 11,"If you always wanted to know when the next National Prime Rib Day or Earth Day is then you may be looking forward to the introduction of Search Highlights on Windows 11. Everyone else may be looking for a way to disable Search Highlights instead.

ADVERTISEMENT

Microsoft introduced Search Highlights in Insider Builds of Windows 11 and ported the feature to Stable versions of Windows 10 next. In the coming weeks and months Search Highlights will roll out to all Windows 11 devices.

Most Windows users come into contact with Search Highlights by accident. They notice a new icon on the taskbar depicting the special event that Microsoft picked for the day. National Prime Rib Day one of your favorites is depicted with meat and knife icons earth day with an icon of earth surrounded by pink hearts.

Search Highlights is actually a dual feature. For home systems it offers ""a look at interesting moments in time and a convenient way to discover content"". For work devices it may help users ""discover and search for content across Microsoft 365"". While the latter may indeed be useful most Windows users would probably agree that the home variant of Search Highlights is not useful.

Microsoft notes that Search Highlights will roll out over the coming months on Windows 11 devices.

Windows 11 users may turn off the feature similarly to how Windows 10 users may disable it. Yo may check out our guide on disabling Search Highlights on Windows 10 here.

Turn off Search Highlights on Windows 11

Open the Start Menu and select Settings or use the keyboard shortcut Windows-I to open the Settings app. Go to Privacy & Security. Select Search permissions on the page that opens. Toggle ""Show search highlights"" on the Search permissions page to turn the feature off.

You may undo the change at any time by changing the state of the preference to On again.

Windows 11 won't change icons on the taskbar of the operating system anymore once you make the change. The search interface does not display information related to Search Highlights anymore when you open it either.

Use the Group Policy Editor to turn off Search Highlights

Note: the Group Policy Editor is only available in professional versions of Windows 11. In other words: it is not available in Windows 11 Home. Check the Registry option below if you use a device with a Home edition.

Use Windows-R to open the runbox. Type gpedit.msc and hit the Enter-key to launch the Group Policy Editor. Go to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Search. Locate and double-click on ""Allow Search Highlights"". Change the state of the policy to ""Disabled"" and select Apply to save the change.

You may undo the change at any time by switching the state of the policy to ""not configured"" or ""enabled"".

Use the Windows Registry to turn off Search Highlights on Windows 11

The Registry edit option is available for all editions of Windows 11.

Use Windows-R to open the runbox. Type regedit.exe and hit the Enter-key to launch the Registry Editor. Confirm the UAC prompt by selecting ""Yes"". Use the address bar at the top to load the following Registry path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search Note: if part of the path is not available right-click on the previous folder and select New > Key. Name the key accordingly to create the full path. Check if EnableDynamicContentInWSB is available under Windows Search. If it is double-click on the preference and set its Value to 0 to turn off Search Highlights. It it does not exist. right-click on Windows Search and select New > Dword (32-bit) Value. Name it EnableDynamicContentInWSB. It should have a value of 0 by default but if that is not the case double-click on it and set its value to 0. Restart the Pc.

Now You: will you keep Search Highlights turned on or will you disable it?

MRNA,Moderna,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzI1L2lmLXlvdS1pbnZlc3RlZC0xMDAwMC1pbi1tb2Rlcm5hLTIteWVhcnMtYWdvLXRoaXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If You Invested $10000 in Moderna 2 Years Ago This Is How Much You Would Have Today,"It's been a rocky ride for the cutting-edge biotech stock.

Moderna (MRNA 0.68%) was one of the best stocks to own last year as it brought its COVID-19 vaccine to market and generated billions in revenue. The company which was a bit of an unknown before the pandemic began has quickly risen in popularity. And even though its shares have been declining this year they're still up a whopping 766% since 2019.

But what if you bought the stock roughly two years ago today after the company's vaccine was already approved? And more importantly is the stock still a good buy now?

Investing in Moderna two years ago would have doubled your money

Two years ago health officials weren't administering Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine yet -- the Food and Drug Administration didn't grant it Emergency Use Authorization (for people 18 years and older) until December 2020. The FDA has since expanded authorization to cover children as young as six months.

However by the end of June 2020 the stock was already rising with shares trading around $64; at the start of the year the stock was worth less than $20. At $64 per share a $10000 investment would have enabled you to buy roughly 156 shares. Today that investment would be worth close to $20600 for a return of 106%.

It would be a bittersweet return given that in September 2021 the stock surged to more than $450 after Moderna unveiled a COVID-19 booster that included a flu shot. But ultimately as a COVID stock Moderna's value has risen along with increasing case numbers and growing concerns about the pandemic. Unsurprisingly amid a return to normalcy its shares have fallen 48% this year performing worse than the S&P 500 which is down by just 21%.

Has the stock become a cheap buy?

If you're looking at earnings multiples you may be inclined to think that investors are missing a huge opportunity. At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of less than five Moderna looks incredibly undervalued; the average stock in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund trades at close to 15 times its future profits.

But investors should remember that future earnings rely on the accuracy of analyst estimates. And even though Moderna may still perform well over the next 12 months it's the uncertainty afterward that likely has investors discounting the stock right now. While Moderna reported an incredible $18 billion in sales for 2021 before the pandemic the company's revenue was declining and in 2019 totaled just $60 million.

There will likely be a significant decline in revenue for Moderna next year unless a resurgence in COVID-19 cases renews demand for vaccines and/or boosters. And that means a much smaller bottom line and a higher P/E multiple effectively eliminating today's bargain.

The stock has become a contrarian pick

If you're investing in Moderna today you have to be comfortable taking on some risk. The company does have products in its pipeline that could replace some lost COVID-19 revenue -- but not all of it. One of its most promising products is mRNA-1647 a vaccine for the cytomegalovirus. That's in phase 3 trials and the company projects that at its peak it could bring in up to $5 billion in annual revenue.

That peak could be years away and that revenue wouldn't come anywhere near the money Moderna is making from its COVID-19 vaccine now. The good news is that Moderna has more than $10 billion on its books in cash and short-term investments that it can use to acquire a company (and now may be a great time amid falling valuations). But if Moderna doesn't make a big move the uncertainty could deter investors from buying the stock.

Moderna isn't the red-hot buy that it was a few years ago. Investors buying the healthcare stock today face the reality that it could continue to decline for the foreseeable future at least until its growth prospects improve.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vYnVja3Njby50b2RheS8yMDIyLzA2L3JhbmRhbGwtbi1oeWVyLWJsdW1iZXJnLWluc3RpdHV0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dr. Randall N.

Hyer a former executive with Moderna replaces Timothy Block Blumberg’s founding president. John George covered the executive handoff in the Philadelphia Business Journal.

Hyer reports to duty July 1. He is a former senior vice president of global medical affairs at Moderna Inc. From its Cambridge Mass. headquarters he shepherded the company’s COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.

Assessing his replacement Block said: “Dr. Hyer’s background makes him perfectly suited for this position and I know he is a tremendous person and scientist.

“While it’s challenging certainly for me personally to hand over the reins Randy brings a new passion and dedication to our mission that will build upon the momentum that exists in the Blumberg Institute.”

Hyer is eager to get going.

“From my first interactions with Dr. Block and the organizations he founded I’ve been extremely impressed with their scientific rigor and their dedication to finding cures and treatments for hepatitis B liver cancer and associated diseases” he said. “The opportunity to serve as president of the Blumberg Institute is exciting and one I warmly and enthusiastically accept.”

Toblerone will have to drop “of Switzerland” from its packaging as the world-famous mountain-shaped chocolate will no longer be exclusively produced in its home country from 2023.

Established in 1908 in the Tobler family factory the instantly-recognisable triangular chocolate is produced exclusively in Bern the Alpine nation’s capital.

But the brand’s owner US food giant Mondelez International said Toblerone will open a new production line in Slovakia by the end of 2023 “to respond to the growing demand”.

The move proved hard to swallow for some in Switzerland unhappy to see a cherished national icon going abroad — especially one which features the famous pyramid-shaped Matterhorn mountain on its packaging and the bear of Bern symbol of the city.

Mondelez International told AFP in an emailed statement that it was continuing to invest in the Bern plant “the homeland of Toblerone”.

“Bern is an important part of our history and will continue to be so in the future” it said.

The launch of a production line in Slovakia where Mondelez also produces Milka and Suchard chocolates “will unlock significant capacity” at the Bern site which will eventually allow it to “manufacture millions of additional bars” Mondelez said.

– Seven billion bars –

But the new plant in Bratislava means they will have to change the labelling.

“For legal reasons the changes we are bringing to our production require us to adjust our packaging to comply with Swiss law in particular to remove the word ‘Switzerland’ from the front of the packaging” the company said.

Swiss newspaper Le Temps added Toblerone to a list of emblematic products no longer exclusively produced in Switzerland including Sugus sweets Milka chocolate and Ovaltine.

Toblerone produces seven billion chocolate bars a year with 97 percent exported to 120 countries.

They are ubiquitous at airport duty-free shops around the world where one bar is sold every two seconds according to Mondelez.

“For the export I would not assume that this plays a role at least for its current customers” said Tobias Schalger professor of marketing at Lausanne University.

“Some like Toblerone for its taste some for its form some for its packaging — and some as it is Swiss. This may have an impact but I assume this impact will be fairly small and not long-lasting.”

The name is a play on words from Tobler and “torrone” — the Italian name for honey-almond nougat. — Agence France-Presse",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3Rjb2FzdGRhaWx5LmluLzIwMjIvMDYvMjUvd29ybGQtZmFtb3VzLXRvYmxlcm9uZS1jaG9jb2xhdGUtdG8tZHJvcC1zd2l0emVybGFuZC1yZWFkLW9uLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World famous Toblerone chocolate to drop 'Switzerland'; Read on.. | DH Latest News DH NEWS Latest News NEWS ...,"Zurich: World famous mountain-shaped chocolate- Toblerone will have to drop ‘Switzerland’ from its packaging as the will no longer be exclusively produced in its home country from 2023.

Mondelez International told AFP in an emailed statement that it was continuing to invest in the Bern plant. The launch of a production line in Slovakia where Mondelez also produces Milka and Suchard chocolates ‘will unlock significant capacity’ at the Bern site which will eventually allow to ‘manufacture millions of additional bars’ Mondelez said. ‘For legal reasons the changes we are bringing to our production require us to adjust our packaging to comply with the Swiss law particularly to remove the word ‘Switzerland’ from the packaging front’ the company said.

Toblerone produces seven billion chocolate bars a year with 97% of the production exported to 120 countries. They are ubitiquitous at airport duty-free shops.",,,,,,

The iconic soft drink remained at the top of Checkout magazine’s Checkout Top 100 Brands 2021 list ahead of Tayto this year’s number two brand and chocolate brand Dairy Milk at number three.

At number four was Lucozade followed by Avonmore in fifth place and Brennans bread at sixth.

Monster continues its move up the list. The energy drink took seventh place a jump from 11th place in last year’s list. The previous year it ranked 25th.

The soft drink 7Up at eighth RedBull at ninth and Jacobs at 10th rounded out the top 10.

The rankings are produced in partnership with NielsenIQ reports The Irish Times. The numbers reflect the value of sales in Ireland’s grocery retail sector for the 12 months leading up to April 25 2021. Private label products were not included in the rankings.

According to Checkout editor Maev Martin the rankings reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on consumer purchasing habits.

“In 2020 we witnessed a big transition to in-home food and drink consumption. This continued into 2021 and will remain with us until there is a return to an open economy.”

In Checkout’s Top 100 Categories list health/functional drinks made the biggest jump rising a “phenomenal” 27 places to 60th. The jump indicates the extent of last year’s market shift.

“This massive upward move isn’t surprising given consumers’ desire to improve their health and boost their immune systems during the pandemic” said Martin.

“Hair Colourants which last featured in our Top 100 in 2014 is the second-highest mover rising by no fewer than 25 places from outside the Top 100 last year – when it ranked at number 108 – to number 83. With hair salons closed for long periods during 2020 and into 2021 it isn’t surprising that this category has re-entered our Top 100 and simultaneously shot up the rankings.""

Love Love Island? Our Factor 50 email brings all the goss direct to your inbox

Boyzone star Shane Lynch and his wife Sheena have traded their celebrity lifestyle to settle down in the suburbs.

Back before Love Island was as huge as it is now Shane appeared in the celebrity version in 2006 but quit when he realised that Sheena was the love of his life. The couple went on to marry a year later in a glam Irish ceremony.

They now have two kids Billie Rae who was born in 2008 and Marley Mae in 2012. Three years ago the family moved to Cheshire and they now run their own pub in the area. The Irish bar is called D13 named after the part of Dublin where Shane grew up.

Shane and Keith Duffy enjoyed a sunny reunion at the Chester Races earlier this week. The pair were snapped alongside former Westlife member Brian McFadden.

Keith was dressed in a navy blazer and jeans while Shane wore a beige waistcoat and matching trousers. Brian opted for a green suit. In a clip with the Shane and Brian posted on Instagram Keith said: ""So boys only fools by horses am I right?""

""Chester Races we've won a fortune. Sorry no I've got that wrong. I'll be back to you in a minute.""

Here's the proof,"Text messages. Mailers. Cold calls. Over the past two years homeowners have been bombarded with inquiries from investors who want to know one thing: Are they open to selling their property?

Since the onset of the Pandemic Housing Boom investors have flooded the U.S. housing market. There are small players like mom-and-pop landlords and Airbnb hosts who are adding to their property portfolios. Home flippers returned with vengeance. There’s also the Wall Street types like Blackstone and iBuyer players like Opendoor Technologies that are gobbling up homes. The combination of low mortgage rates easy access to capital and record home appreciation was all too enticing for investors to pass up on.

However even as investors piled into the housing market many real estate insiders over the past two years hesitated to attribute much if any of the boom to investors. In their view numerous factors drove the housing frenzy. Historically low mortgage rates spurred by the Federal Reserve’s response to the COVID-19 recession attracted all types of buyers. That included white-collar professionals who saw their jobs transition to remote during the pandemic and were eager to ditch apartments in places like San Francisco and Boston for homes in markets like Boise and Tampa. The pandemic also coincided with the five-year window (between 2019 and 2023) when millennials born during the generation’s five largest birth years (between 1989 and 1993) would hit the peak first-time homebuying age of 30. That elevated demand simply overwhelmed the supply side: Housing inventory which was already trending downward before the pandemic struck fell to a 40-year low during the boom.

But that hesitation to name investors as one of the pillars of the Pandemic Housing Boom is no longer necessary. It’s now abundantly clear that investors did indeed help accelerate the housing boom and drive up U.S. home prices. At least that’s what Fortune concluded after looking over recent data published by Redfin Freddie Mac and the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.

In the first quarter of 2022 investors made up a record 28% of single-family home sales according to a report published last week by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. That’s up from 19% in the first quarter of 2021. It’s also far above the 16% that investors made up of single-family home sales between 2017 and 2019. (To conduct the analysis the Harvard researchers analyzed home sale data collected by CoreLogic.)

The investor bull rush into the housing market was the most pronounced in fast-growing markets in the U.S. South and West according to the Harvard researchers. That finding is backed up by a separate Redfin analysis which looked at all home sales (unlike Harvard’s single-family homes analysis). In the first quarter of 2022 investors made up a staggering 33.1% of home sales in Atlanta. Not far behind was Jacksonville (32.3%) Charlotte (32.3%) Phoenix (29.0%) and Miami (28.2%). Those same markets are also among the nation’s most “overvalued” housing markets that are at risk of seeing a home price decline according to Moody’s Analytics.

While markets in the South and West saw the most investor activity almost every major U.S. housing market saw an uptick. Among the 31 large markets analyzed by Redfin 29 saw an uptick in investor activity. Look no further than Ohio which saw the share of investor homes sales jump in Cincinnati (up 2.9 percentage points) Cleveland (up 3.1 percentage points) and Columbus (up 7 percentage points). Between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 only Seattle (down 0.5 percentage point) and Milwaukee (down 0.1 percentage point) saw a decline in the share of home sales attributed to investors.

Researchers at Freddie Mac who did their own analysis of public records found a more modest jump in investor purchases than Harvard and Redfin researchers. Between December 2019 and December 2021 Freddie Mac found investor home purchases climbed from 26.7% to 27.6%. However Freddie Mac acknowledges its analysis isn’t fully capturing all-cash purchases by investors.

Let’s be clear: The vast majority of investor home purchases in America are still made by small or midsize investors: ranging from average Joes owning an Airbnb rental to individuals who’ve spent years amassing a hefty portfolio of rentals. According to the Harvard study 74% of investor purchases in September were made by investors with portfolios of less than 100 properties. The remaining 26% of investor purchases were made by groups with property portfolios of at least 100 units.

That said it’s clear that those big investors were among the biggest drivers of the uptick in investor purchases.

“Investors with large portfolios (at least 100 properties) drove much of this growth nearly doubling their share of investor purchases from 14% in September 2020 to 26% in September 2021” wrote the Harvard researchers. “By buying up single-family homes investors have reduced the already limited supply available to potential owner-occupants particularly first-time and moderate-income buyers.”

Who are these big investors? Some are massive rental companies like Invitation Homes—the nation's largest owner of single-family rental homes—which grew its portfolio during the pandemic. Blackstone which founded Invitation Homes back in 2012 also got back into the single-family home business during the pandemic. (In 2019 Blackstone had backed away from the business after selling its remaining shares of Invitation Homes.)

The Pandemic Housing Boom also saw a surge on the iBuying side of the market. These iBuyers—including firms like Opendoor Offerpad RedfinNow and Zillow Offers—went around the country making swift offers to home sellers. The companies would then quickly put the home back on the market. It's less of a traditional ""home flip"" and more of a volume play: On each sale iBuyers net a ""service fee"" that the firm charges the buyer in exchange for the speedy transaction.

As the housing boom took hold it saw Zillow’s earnings initially soar—with the real estate site posting a record $52 million profit in the first quarter of 2021. That fed Zillow’s iBuyer confidence as it quickly grew its home buying business to over three-fourths of its total revenues. Of course Zillow's home flipping business would go on to implode in epic fashion last fall. But only after Zillow’s much-lauded algorithm overpaid analysts tell Fortune for thousands of U.S. homes.

But most housing investors are still groups you’ve likely never heard of. The Opendoor and Blackstones of the world at least for now are still a small piece of the investor pie.

“While large corporate investors are rapidly rising as a share of the market and are likely to expand they remain so small that their market share only has a modest impact on the overall percentage of investors” wrote Freddie Mac researchers earlier this month. During the pandemic iBuyer and institutional buyers have jumped from around a 1.5% market share of purchases to around 4.5% according to Freddie Mac.

It's intellectually dishonest to pin soaring U.S. home prices—which are up 37% over the past two years—on any one company. However when you step back and examine the elevated demand that has come from the investor side of the market it's clear they've attributed at least in some degree to soaring home prices. Investors both big and small gobbled up a larger market share during the pandemic. The impact of elevated investor demand also goes beyond the homes they actually bought. Even when investors are on the losing side of a bidding war from an economic lens at least they are still putting upward pressure on prices.

As the Pandemic Housing Boom implodes amid spiked mortgage rates it raises the question: Is the investor rush into the housing market a temporary feature of the pandemic or the start of a lasting trend?

While spiked mortgage rates are pricing out many first-time buyers it's also seeing investors pull back from the market. Surging mortgage rates change the math for investors: The added costs means many investors would take on mortgage payments that are greater than they can charge for rent.

“Investor home purchases are falling for the same reason overall home purchases are falling: Surging interest rates and high housing prices have made it more expensive to get a mortgage and buy a home” wrote Sheharyar Bokhari a senior economist at Redfin in a report published this month. “While roughly three-quarters of investor purchases are made with cash investors are still impacted by interest rates because they often take out loans to get that cash.”

Mainwaring as Daniel and Josh Adams as Chris — are spellbinding together. Their unabashed attraction is palpable.

With culture wars reheating and a theocratic dystopia on the horizon this would be a fine time to produce a truthful and empathic play about the tension between homosexuality and the Christian faith. Which is precisely what Mosaic has done with Benjamin Benne’s In His Hands — a homoerotic rom-com framed as a pas de deux between two male millennials locked in a dance of desire and doctrine-induced disgrace.

And OMG it’s good.

The two leads — Michael J. Mainwaring as Daniel and Josh Adams as Chris — are spellbinding together. As stirringly directed by José Carrasquillo their every moment on stage is an occasion for mesmerizing physicality movement choreographed to meet up with each meter of Benne’s poetic text. At times it is like watching two danseurs do dialogue. Their lines live in body language. Their unabashed attraction is palpable.

As the play begins Daniel has recently received a master of divinity degree from Yale and aspires to be an ordained Lutheran pastor. In the meantime he is working as a receptionist at a Seattle tech start-up. One day Chris arrives to interview for an open engineering position. Daniel crushes on him instantly. “Dear God” Daniel prays “please let them hire this cute boy.”

Chris gets the job and a budding boy-boy romance ensues played out with candy and video games and some very blunt talk about sex and religion.

It turns out that notwithstanding Daniel’s and Chris’s hots for each other there are some obstacles between them to surmount. For one thing Daniel prefers anal and is averse to oral which Chris cannot comprehend. Daniel seeks a real-life relationship with a lover whereas Chris doesn’t believe in love and never has sex with people he knows only with men from an app. More important Daniel has an abiding Christian faith and Chris who was raised Baptist has lost his utterly.

Chris never uses his given name Christian. His devout father sent him to an ex-gay conversion therapist to straighten him out. That left a psychic scar. Daniel too bears scars real ones. The differences that Benne has put between his very appealing protagonists not only create a “will they or won’t they?” momentum in the consummation of their sexual attraction; those differences drive the play’s deep inquiry into the roots of religion-inspired homo hate.

Dare I say it?: There comes a revelation. From Daniel the divinity student no less.

Chris’s father (Sasha Olinick) and therapist (Joe Mallon) each make an appearance and jointly flesh out the backstory of Chris’s defection from faith. Olnick and Mallon both pros give unequivocal gravity to Chris’s issues. They do not dance as Daniel and Chris do however; they play it straight so to speak; as a consequence the play’s pace drops somewhat when they’re on. Nonetheless Benne’s father and therapist scenes will hit home for anyone who rejected the religion in which they were raised because that religion rejected them or anyone who is estranged from a parent who was incapable of loving their queer kid.

Tony Cisek (scenic design) Sarah O’Halloran (sound design) and William D’Eugenio (lighting design) have pulled off a miracle of integrated stagecraft. Daniel and Chris are performed barefoot on an all-black set framed in forced-perspective light bands that change colors like a rainbow in sync with their hearts. Sounds amplify their every interaction and burst into Handel’s Messiah when they kiss. Lights shine down ethereally through a perpetual heavenly mist. The shiny surface of the stage reflects Daniel’s and Chris’s bodies in bed as if on the bank of Narcissus’ pond.

Daniel and Chris’s passionate “will they or won’t they?” drama about sexuality and belief is full of feeling and rich in insight. Underlying it at this political moment of course is a glaring “Will we?”: Will we as a society ever learn to love one another as Someone once recommended we do?

See In His Hands for some hope.

Camera details

The images were recorded with the Infrared VarioCAM HD head 680 from InfraTec17 which was positioned in a helicopter with the nadir downwards view towards the sea ice surface (Fig. 2). All essential technical details about the IR camera are highlighted in this paragraph and listed in Table 1. The broadband thermal infrared imaging was performed in the thermal infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum from 7.5 to 14 μm which includes the Earth’s radiation peak at 10 μm [18 page 293]. The accuracy for the measured brightness temperature is 1 K and its precision is 0.02 K. To distinguish features on the ground within one image the precision is more important than the accuracy. The calibration of the device was done down to the target temperature of −8 °C with a measured deviation of 0.6 K. It has to be considered that the measurements had mainly been performed at lower temperatures. The minimum temperature by the manufacturer is −40 °C while we could measure even lower temperatures of the sky. During the measurement we reached the limit a few times but did not exceed the limit extensively. Therefore the accuracy could slightly change for colder temperatures but this is neglected in this study. A sufficient overlap of the images is guaranteed by an acquisition rate of 1 Hz. The raw data were measured at an even higher frequency of 4 Hz but down-sampled here to 1 Hz. During the recording every 15 to 60 seconds a non-uniformity compensation (NUC) ensured that there was a minimized camera-internal drift in the temperature. The focus was adjusted after reaching the final flight altitude and stayed fixed for the whole flight. We assume to have the same focus for all flights because all measurements were performed at the similar flight altitude. More information about the device ir_variocam_02 and its actions during the expedition are stored in the Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI) Sensor platform (https://sensor.awi.de/)17.

Helicopter-borne survey flights

The 35 flights were conducted during the first three legs of the expedition between 02 October 2019 and 23 April 2020 at an altitude of around 300 m and with a duration of about 90 minutes. The general objective of this measurement program was to have weekly flights. The frequency of flights varied because it depended on the weather conditions was adapted to cover interesting events in the sea ice area and some flights had to be aborted due to bad weather. There was a higher flight frequency in the earlier part of the drift but a lower frequency in the latter part. This resulted in a larger geographic distance between the flights due to a faster ice drift during that period (Fig. 3); mind that the local ice surface did not necessarily change faster because of that because the MOSAiC was drifting with the ice. Nine flights are not included in this dataset yet because they require additional processing e.g. the IR camera has missing GPS data. They include seven flights from the wintertime and two flights during the last leg in September 2020 which were mainly conducted over thin ice areas at the ice margins and not cover the MOSAiC floe. Their data will be published at a later stage.

Fig. 3 The map presents the locations of the measurements included in this study. The location of helicopter flights are marked with black triangles along the MOSAiC drift track from the northern Laptev Sea towards the Fram Strait with color-coded time. Full size image

There are four different flight types in our measurement program that cover (i) the Central Observatory (CO) (ii) the three nodes of large sensor sites (L-Sites) (L1 L2 L3) in the Distributed Network (DN) (iii) single L-Site (grids) or (iv) a specific event e.g. a lead opening. The CO flights (i) observed the local ice conditions of the MOSAiC ice floe in high spatial detail (Fig. 4(a)) and L-Site flights (ii) allowed an investigation of the ice conditions on a regional scale. The regional L-Site flights (ii) were flown in a triangle pattern covering the three L-Sites located in the corners of the flight pattern (Fig. 4(b)). On 08 January 2020 the different L-Sites were overflown separately in the same patterns as the CO surveys i.e. single L-Site grids (iii). The main weekly time series consists of the CO flights (i) and L-Site flights (ii).

Fig. 4 To get an idea about the coverage of surface for different flight patterns we display the flight tracks for (a) local CO flight 20191002_01 and (b) regional L-site flight 20200123_01. The axes show the distance in meter. The center point (00) is the location of RV Polarstern. For the flight 20191002_01 in (a) (00) is outside the map because RV Polarstern was not located at the MOSAiC ice floe yet. Full size image

Sea ice surface temperature

In the thermal infrared range the measured brightness temperature is close to the actual surface temperature. As a first approximation the surface temperature T s was calculated from the up-welling brightness temperature T bup  measured with the IR Camera and the emissivity e [18 page 294] with

$${T}_{{\rm{s}}}=\frac{{T}_{{\rm{b}}{\rm{up}}}}{e}.$$ (1)

For emissivities close to one as in our case the measured brightness temperature can be approximated to change linearly with the physical temperature. The Plank law is already considered during the recording of the brightness temperature. The influence of the down-welling brightness temperature was neglected for simplicity. The emissivity e is assumed to be a constant value of 0.996 for all incidence angles and surface types following Høyer et al. (2017)19. Here the downwelling contribution with (1-e) T s would be 1 K at 250 K surface temperature which is the same range as the accuracy of the measured temperature. We used this emissivity because the instrument of the Hoyer et al. study i.e. a Cambell Scientific IR120 radiometer has with 8 to 14 μm a very similar spectral range to our instrument. However the spectral weight function might differ. An emissivity of 0.97 was used for other infrared observations e.g. by the NSIDC during Operation IceBridge flights with a KT19 thermometer with a spectral response from 9.6 to 11.5 μm. The lower emissivity value of 0.97 would lead to overestimated surface temperatures compared to our used value of 0.996. The accuracy of the surface temperature is determined by the accuracy of the brightness temperature (1 K see Camera details) as well as of the accuracy of the emissivity. The additional uncertainty by the emissivity can be influenced by the incidence angle or change of surface type20.

In future studies the aim is to apply a more detailed theory to retrieve a higher accuracy of the surface temperature T s . Additionally it has to be considered that the penetration depth for thermal infrared radiation is very small of a few μm which allows an influence by atmospheric parameters like the air temperature wind speed or cloud cover [18 page 294].

Image correction

Corner mask

In all flights warm temperature anomalies were found in one corner. The IR camera looked through an open cutout in the helicopter bottom structure. The higher values were probably caused by a shielding effect from the structure of the helicopter which slightly influenced the temperature recording in the respective corner. To remove false high temperatures in the respective corner a corner mask is provided for every flight and can be applied to each image. We generally recommend to exclude the corner areas of the images in any case due to distortions in the higher incidence angle regime.

Radial image gradient

In every image a radial gradient of the recorded temperature occurs. This gradient is likely caused by an artificial effect of the camera. We corrected it by an empirical radial gradient which is calculated by averaging images of a flight and applied for every flight independently. For this only images with an average temperature below the 25th percentile of all images are considered to exclude warm features like leads which could influence the resulting gradient. The gradient is relative to the center temperature which is assumed to be the truth. This lens effect correction was applied to all datasets and the correction array is included in the image-based dataset for every flight so that the original uncorrected images can be reproduced if needed. In Fig. 5 a case example from the flight on 02 October 2019 illustrates the correction of an image by the gradient. The original image (Fig. 5(a)) shows colder outer parts of the image. With the reference value in the center of the image the image was corrected by a specific factor (Fig. 5(b)) resulting in a corrected image without a radial gradient (Fig. 5(c)).

Mapping

After processing the image data we produced flight maps by combining all images in one grid. The gridded data set consists of temperature values with assigned coordinates (longitude and latitude) as well as relative coordinates to Polarstern for co-location with other measurements. This mapping was done in three steps which are described in more detail in the following and which is illustrated in Fig. 6. First the ice drift correction was performed to correct the coordinates to the target time which is the middle of the flight. Second all image pixels had to be georeferenced under consideration of the helicopter position and rotation. Third and last all pixels were assigned to the closest grid cell in the equidistant grid.

Fig. 6 The schematic illustrates the different parts of the mapping method applied to the images. We calculate the positions on the ground based on the helicopter position (a1) which change with the helicopter position and rotation (a2). We also consider the reduction of the ellipsoid height from the GPS by the mean sea surface height h mss because it changes the actual position of the pixel on the plane. The pixel locations are determined based on the reference point (x i  y i ) at the known nadir location. In the next step the projection method starts with the data array from the image (b1) which is further processed to the georeferenced images with xy coordinates (b2). Finally the pixels of the image are assigned to an equidistant grid with a stereographic projection (b3). Full size image

Some images were discarded if they were outside the main flight pattern not yet at the main flight altitude level of around 300 m or not usable due to the internal calibration (NUC). Here one image per NUC had to be discarded. As a benefit of excluding the discarded images the maps are more compact in terms of data coverage of the covered area and better suited for the statistical and visual interpretation of the spatial variability in the defined area. In the following part we explain the detailed methods for the image mapping.

Ice drift correction

Assuming the average ice drift of 8.52 km/d according to Krumpen et al.3 the sea ice drifted about 500 m during a 90-minute flight. Thus a piece of ice at a specific location at the beginning of the flight was at another location later during the flight. Therefore we corrected the coordinates of every image based on the drift of RV Polarstern to be in the coordinate system of the target time in the middle of each flight. The position and heading data212223 of RV Polarstern which was achored directly to the ice floe were recorded with the high-performance inertial navigation system (INS) Motion Sensor Hydrins 124. For the ice drift correction we use linear interpolated data of 10-minutes interval Polarstern positions to correct each image accordingly with the assumption of homogeneous ice movement across the entire flight area. We took the GPS position at the target time as the reference point for the stereographic projection which is used for the final gridded temperature maps. RV Polarstern is always in the center of the stereographic projection and for the rotated relative coordinates RV Polarstern’s heading is defining the positive y-axis and the starboard direction is the positive x-axis. By this relative distances of the flight data are kept comparable between all flights. The resulting map contains the locations of the observed sea ice surface at the target time. This was used to calculate a relative coordinate system with distances towards the reference point at RV Polarstern.

Georeferencing

Based on the corrected image location and the stereographic projection every pixel is geolocated. All projections are done with the WGS84 ellipsoid. The geolocation of each pixel is determined based on a pinhole camera model and a transformation from the camera to the plane25. While the pitch angle was generally low during the flight the roll angle was increased during turns and discarded in cases of a high angle with more than 40 degrees to avoid large distortions in the projection. Values from images with a high roll angle were discarded if data with a roll of less than 20 degrees were available. In general we would recommend using the data of high roll angle with caution because large distortion can cause uncertainties in the geolocation. We correct the ellipsoid height measured by the helicopter GNSS by the mean sea surface height by Andersen and Knudsen (2009)26. Additionally we perform a distortion correction for the images to reach a more accurate pixel position. We use the positioning data which were recorded with an embedded GNSS inertial system Applanix AP 60-AIR27 which was installed in the helicopter next to the IR camera (Fig. 2).

For an increased accuracy in the geolocation we performed an optimization for the following six input parameters:

Time (time offset between IR Camera and GNSS)

Three components of a fixed camera rotation with respect to the helicopter (roll pitch heading)

Internal camera parameters (effective focal length radial distortion coefficient)

The optimization procedure consists of different steps. At first common features between different images were determined using a consecutive execution of edge detection pattern matching homograhic fitting and cleaning using a RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus28) based method. The euclidean distance between the same feature in pairs of two different images in the final coordinate system is subject to minimization. Since the feature detection despite initial outlier correction were not perfect even for a good matching parameter a high bias in the sum or mean of the determined distances. Therefore we used a loss function employing the 70th percentile of the distances of ground projected point matches in one images pair and then another 70th percentile of these values from all used images as loss. This parameter was then minimized using an adaptive differential evolution optimizer29.

For our processing we determined two different sets of correction parameters because there was change of the camera setup at the start of Leg 2. The parameter are listed with the order (time offset roll offset pitch offset heading offset effective focal length radial distortion coefficient):

For Leg 1 (until 20191206_01): (0.49762 0.458456 0.134936 88.3343 604.362 −0.407934)

For Leg 2 and 3 (20191224_01 onwards): (0.510041 0.349084 −0.279992 90.2153604.107 −0.420221)

For the respective leg the optimization was done for one specific flight i.e. 20191002_01 for Leg 1 and 20191224_01 for Leg 2. Since there was the same camera on all three legs the focal length and radial distortion parameter should not change. As a result determined by the optimization these parameters ended up very close. For all flights we use these optimized parameters. Additionally we manually determined a time offset for each flight because the IR camera is recording the time only with the full second. But for a flight speed of around 45 m/s a time difference of 0.5 s can already cause a significant position shift of the images. As expected we have mostly a time correction below 1 s. In cases of a higher time shift probably the required initial time synchronisation was not performed. The time offset for every flight is included in the image NetCDF file while the time variable contains the final (corrected) time used.

In addition the following modifications had to be done during the processing:

Until 20191130_01: rotation of image by 180° (camera was rotated in the helicopter)

Excluding images in the middle of the flight 20191105_01 because of missing position data

Correct heading by the difference of the actual longitude and the central longitude of the projection

Change of sign of pitch angle

Gridding

After having a georeference for all pixels in every image we assigned the pixels of all images to an equidistant grid of 1 m. The original images have a higher resolution of approximately 0.5 m at nadir. However 1 m guarantees full coverage of all grid points for the final map even under a higher incidence angle. After the ice drift correction the pixel coordinates of all images are assigned to a grid cell of the stereographic grid map referenced to the target time (Fig. 6). In case several values fit in one grid cell the value closest to the target time was taken and the overlap discarded. In addition to the gridded surface temperature we included the longitude latitude time roll and pitch measured by the Applanix AP 60-AIR27 as gridded data as well. This set of parameters contains all necessary information for the interpretation of the physical parameters. We also included relative coordinates which are comparable for the whole dataset period. They have one constant reference point at RV Polarstern whereas the longitude and latitude coordinates were changing constantly with the drift. The rotated relative coordinates have always the same orientationalso with RV Polarstern as reference (see Ice drift correction). The 5 m resolution are the block average of the 1 m resolution data.

Uncertainties of the geolocation

Uncertainties in the mapping can be caused by the ice drift correction which is well-defined for the area of the CO close to RV Polarstern but can differ for outer areas. The surrounding sea ice could have drifted differently than the CO during the flight which cannot be considered because there are no data available. However this effect is small for the duration of one flight. Three to five Automatic Identification System (AIS) base-stations were installed in the CO which could have served as an alternative to provide the ice drift correction. However compared to the ship GNSS and INS system the AIS stations showed jitter of tens of meters i.e. noise in the GPS position with time which could lead to a temporal variability of the signal and therefore some inconsistencies. Therefore we decided to use the RV Polarstern position data. The only disadvantage of that would occur if RV Polarstern would move relative to the CO during a helicopter flight which did not happen for our flights here mentioned. The uncertainty of the ship’s navigation system Hydrins is 0.01 deg for the heading and 0.03 m for the position24 which is neglectable for our 1 m resolution data.

Additionally there are uncertainties caused by the installation of the instruments in the helicopter. The IR camera and the INS were deployed at different positions on the instruments plate in the helicopter both with independent spring dampers (Fig. 2) which could respond differently to vibrations of the helicopter. This would result in small angular noise which was neglected. The uncertainty from the positional difference is small and is mostly overcome with the optimization which provides us with the optimal input parameter for the given setup. The pixel distance at the surface is dependent on the flight altitude which we corrected by the mean sea surface height (Fig. 6(a1)) but did not consider the changes due to tides currents or atmospheric pressure loading. In addition IR camera images were projected to a plane at the distance of the helicopter to the mean sea surface height which is probably lower than the sea ice surface. But compared to the difference to the actual surface height we consider this error negligible. The outer areas of the images (100 pixels in y-direction the small axis of the image) were cut off to reduce the effect of perspective and corresponding lowering of the resolution in the mapped data. Even with this cut of the data coverage along flight direction is sufficient since the overlap is large. There might be a small time-drift in the IR camera time (<2 s/day i.e. about 0.1 s per flight) which can reduce the matching of the position data and the image. Based on the results of the georeferencing and gridding we estimate the error of geolocation to a maximum of 10 m. For the L-sites flights with large distances to RV Polarstern a larger shift is possible due to e.g. inhomogeneous ice drift. Since the flights were performed quite far north it has to be considered that the INS data quality was degraded due to the close proximity to the earth rotational axes30. Further quantification of the actual pixel-wise uncertainty in geolocation can not be performed with the methods available to us. Small shifts in the geolocation can cause issues in the matching of the same features from different images but this does not change the statistics of the surface temperatures. Further quantification of geolocation uncertainty requires co-location with other point measurements on the floe which was not performed for this dataset.

Temperature-drift correction

During most flights the temperature changes with time. This becomes clearly visible when different swathes in one flight are crossing. As an example two neighboring images from different times within a flight have a temperature difference of 2.6 K for the local flights 20191105_01 or 20191230_01 and even 3.95 K for the regional flight 20191230_01. That is physically reasonable because changes in atmospheric parameters like cloud cover wind speed or air temperature can alter the surface temperature within the flight duration of about 90 minutes. A further investigation of the reasoning for this temperature drift will be performed in another study. However this temporal temperature change would make it challenging or not possible to analyze the temperature maps of a whole flight coherently. Thus we derived the time-fixed surface temperature by a temporal correction of the temperature change. This makes surface features in the data more easily interpretable because the temporal temperature changes do not have to be taken into account. For this we corrected the surface temperatures of a whole flight by relative differences to the target time in the middle of the flight. The fixed surface temperature T sfixed was corrected based on the fit function f i of the 10th percentile as lowest surface temperature T s values for each image (Eq. 2). The 10th percentile was chosen because it represents the fairly constant background temperature of cold snow-covered thick ice and is not influenced by varying warmer features like cracks in the sea ice.

The temporal temperature change was corrected by a fit function with the target time t 0 and the actual time of the pixel t (Eq. 2):

$${T}_{sfixed}={T}_{{\rm{s}}}-({f}_{i}(t)-{f}_{i}({t}_{0}))$$ (2)

whereas f i represents the fit function. Since there are different temporal behaviour for the flights there are four fit types applied on every flight which are tested for all flights: 1) linear 2) quadratic 3) third-degree polynomial and 4) exponential (Eq. 3 to Eq. 6):

$${f}_{{\rm{lin}}}(t)={{\rm{a}}}_{1}\cdot t+{\rm{c}}$$ (3)

$${f}_{{\rm{quad}}}(t)={{\rm{a}}}_{2}\cdot {t}^{2}+{{\rm{a}}}_{1}\cdot t+{\rm{c}}$$ (4)

$${f}_{{\rm{poly}}}(t)={{\rm{a}}}_{3}\cdot {t}^{3}+{{\rm{a}}}_{2}\cdot {t}^{2}+{{\rm{a}}}_{1}\cdot t+{\rm{c}}$$ (5)

$${f}_{{\rm{\exp }}}(t)={\rm{a}}\cdot {\rm{\exp }}\left(-{\rm{b}}\cdot \left(t-{t}_{0}\right)\right)+{\rm{c}}.$$ (6)

The best fit type was selected by the smallest Chi-squared statistic. The selected flight-specific fit type and parameters are listed in Table 2. The fit parameters a 1  a 2  a 3  a b and c are fixed for each flight. The time t is given in seconds since day start. For the exponential fit the initial guess was: (a = 0 b = 0.0001 c = 200). Some flights needed a slightly different initial guess with (a = −0.1 b = 0.0001 c = 200) or (a = 0 b = −0.0001c = 200) because otherwise no solution could be found. The fit was performed to data only in the vicinity of the center of the CO i.e. the position of RV Polarstern with 1 km extent in every direction and 100 measurement points from the start and end of the flight to cover the whole period. Often the flight starts and ends close to RV Polarstern anyway. As an exception the mean longitude and latitude were used as the center point for the first CO and the three L-Site grids because during the flight RV Polarstern was not overflown. This restriction ensures that mostly the same sea ice surfaces of the CO are considered for the fit. That is especially important for the regional flights where a larger area and therefore a larger variability of surface temperatures is included. The temperature range for every flight (Table 2) is an indicator of the magnitude of temperature change in the respective flight. Here we considered the range between start and endpoint as an estimation of the homogeneity of the respective flight.",,,,,,,,,

(Photo provided)

The Oswego Village Board has approved the purchase of an armored vehicle and an agreement for the purchase of body-worn cameras and in-car video systems for the village’s police department at a total cost of $577306.

The board authorized the purchases as part of their consent agenda during a meeting Tuesday evening June 14.

As approved village police will be acquiring a Lenco Bearcat G-2 armored truck from Lenco Armored Vehicles at a cost of $251136.

In a separate agreement with Motorola Solutions the village will purchase 16 in-car video systems 53 body-worn cameras accessories data storage and installation at a cost of $326170 over the next five years. The department will make an initial payment of $72746 and four annual payments of $61116.

The armored vehicle was included in the department’s FY23 Vehicle Fund budget. The vehicle will be purchased with funding from asset forfeiture restricted funds and the Vehicle Fund according to Police Chief Jeff Burgner.

Burgner said his intent is to have his front-line officers trained to use the vehicle so in the event of an active shooter or in the event people need to be rescued from a building they won’t have to wait for a SWAT team.

“We’ve had this in our capital budget for about three years” Burgner said. “It’s something that we’ve looked at as a useful piece of equipment for those very limited circumstances.”

In a memo to the board Burgner further detailed the need and how police will utilize the the armored vehicle.

“The approach for police response to firearms related emergency calls for service has changed significantly over the last twenty years. Since the school shooting at Columbine High School in 1999 law enforcement has significantly changed tactical responses to these types of violent calls as well as other firearms related emergency calls” the memo stated.

“The equipment needed to respond has evolved and front-line police officers are training comparable to how Special Response Teams (SRT) traditionally responded. Front line patrol officers are trained to rapidly respond to active shooter or violent firearm emergency calls for service using advanced tactical training and specialized equipment they receive at their respective police department” the memo stated.

In a presentation to the board from October 2020 Burgner detailed the department’s need for body-worn cameras and how they would be used by the department. The department has been investigating the deployment of BWC’s since 2015 according to the presentation.

“BWC’s are another tool to assist in the maintenance of transparency and accountability” the presentation stated.

Body-worn cameras are useful in confirming officer accounts verifying and protecting officers against baseless complaints and gathering information potentially vital to the village in lawsuits according to the presentation.

The presentation states that the cameras are also useful in evidence collecting and for training purposes.

Under the state’s Law Enforcement Officer-Worn Body Camera Act all Illinois law enforcement agencies will be required to have body cameras by 2025.",,,,,,,,,

(NASDAQ:ETSY) Worth Looking At Closely?,"Let's talk about the popular Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Etsy’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

See our latest analysis for Etsy

What's the opportunity in Etsy?

Etsy appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 24.39x is currently well-above the industry average of 15.03x meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Etsy’s share price is quite volatile this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

Can we expect growth from Etsy?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Etsy's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 71% indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What this means for you:

Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ETSY’s positive outlook with shares trading above industry price multiples. However this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ETSY should trade below its current price selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ETSY for some time now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for ETSY which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. For example - Etsy has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

As much as you might hate to hear this stock market corrections and bear markets are a perfectly normal part of the investing cycle. Including the current bear market decline that the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-focused Nasdaq Composite are navigating their way through the broader market has dropped by a double-digit percentage on average every 1.85 years since the beginning of 1950.

But there's another side to this coin. Despite corrections being commonplace the amount of time Wall Street spends in a bull market handily outpaces periods of pessimism. In other words stock market corrections and bear market dips serve as the perfect opportunity for patient investors to pounce.

Following peak declines of 24% in the S&P 500 and 34% in the Nasdaq from their respective all-time highs there are plenty of amazing deals to be had. The following five unique and highly innovative stocks all have the potential to generate transformational wealth for investors willing to give them the time to do so.

Novavax

First up is specialty biotech stock Novavax (NVAX -3.04%) which is one of a handful of companies to have developed a COVID-19 vaccine. Despite Wall Street's skepticism of the company entering developed markets after established players like Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech Novavax's future looks exceptionally bright.

Novavax has conducted three large-scale clinical trials for NVX-CoV2373 with two adult studies producing respective vaccine efficacies (VEs) of 89.7% and 90.4%. Meanwhile a study on adolescents which was released earlier this year generated an 80% VE. As one of only three COVID-19 vaccine producers to hit the elusive 90% VE mark Novavax has an opportunity to be a leader in booster shots and/or initial inoculation campaigns in developed and emerging markets.

What's even more important to recognize is that Novavax's drug-development platform is a success. This is a company that can beat its competitors to market with a combination influenza/COVID-19 vaccine or perhaps other vaccines targeting airborne viruses.

If you need one more reason to be excited about this company's future keep in mind that Novavax ended March with $1.57 billion in cash and cash equivalents. It's swimming with capital to fund its future research.

Lovesac

A second unique stock that's fully capable of helping long-term investors build transformational wealth is furniture company Lovesac (LOVE -0.12%). Although retail stocks are universally despised at the moment Lovesac offers true differentiation in an industry ripe for disruption.

This differentiation begins with the company's furniture. While once known for selling ""sacs"" the company's beanbag-styled chairs Lovesac's top-seller (87.6% of net sales in fiscal 2022) is now its ""sactional."" A sactional is a modular couch that looks like a sectional couch. However it can be rearranged dozens of ways to fit virtually any living space.

To add to this point sactionals comes with a bevy of options traditional couches don't offer. Buyers can choose from one of more than 200 different covers to match the color or theme of their home and the yarn in these covers is made entirely from recycled plastic water bottles. Sactionals can also be upgraded to include surround-sound or wireless charging systems.

But arguably the best aspect of Lovesac's operating model is its nimbleness. The company's omnichannel sales platform allowed it to pivot to online sales during the pandemic. When coupled with brand-name in-store and online partnerships along with popup showrooms Lovesac's overhead costs clock in substantially lower than its predominantly brick-and-mortar-based peers.

Pinterest

Social media stock Pinterest (PINS 1.77%) is another unique company that has the ability to generate life-changing wealth for patient investors. Even though ad-driven businesses like Pinterest are clearly out of favor with the growing likelihood of a recession this is a company that offers clear and sustainable competitive advantages.

The most telling aspect of Pinterest's success has been its ability to monetize its users. Despite a drop of 45 million monthly active users (MAUs) in the first quarter Pinterest's average revenue per user (ARPU) grew 28% globally including 40% in Europe and 164% in its ""Rest of World"" category. What this ARPU growth illustrates is that advertisers are willing to pay a premium to get their message in front of Pinterest's 433 million MAUs.

To build on this point Pinterest's recent MAU decline appears benign. It coincides with COVID-19 vaccination rates picking up and people returning to some semblance of normal. When the lens is widened Pinterest's five-year MAU growth has steadily trended higher.

Furthermore Pinterest's entire operating model is based on the premise that users are willingly sharing the things places and services that interest them. This makes it incredibly easy for the company to help merchants target users.

Root

A fourth unique stock with transformational wealth potential -- and possibly the one with the highest risk-versus-reward potential on this list -- is technology-driven insurance stock Root (ROOT -0.78%). If Root can overcome sizable short-term losses its new method of pricing insurance policies could change a stodgy industry.

For decades auto insurance companies have priced their policies using broad-based metrics such as a person's marital status or credit score. Unfortunately neither statistic provides any insight into what really matters -- i.e. how safe a person is behind the wheel.

What Root does is lean on telematics to price its policies. By utilizing sensors in smartphones Root can get an accurate understanding of a person's driving habits. When combined with other dynamic factors the company can offer drivers a tailor-priced policy. Note that this approach to policy pricing can be introduced into other insurance verticals too.

Thus far Root's operating approach has demonstrated promise as illustrated by its quarterly gross accident period loss ratios below 100%. A loss ratio of less than 100% signifies a profitably written policy. While there's still work to be done with regard to refining its dynamic pricing model Root has the potential to completely transform the auto insurance industry.

Berkshire Hathaway

Last but not least conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.14%) (BRK.B 0.06%) can help long-term investors generate transformational wealth. Although Warren Buffett's company recently found its way to a 52-week low the Oracle of Omaha's track record speaks for itself.

Since becoming CEO in 1965 Warren Buffett has created more than $590 billion in value for his shareholders and overseen an average annual return of 20.1% for the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) through Dec. 31 2021. In aggregate this works out to an increase of 3641613%! Even if Buffett isn't able to generate an average annual return of 20.1% going forward he's proven adept at outpacing the S&P 500 over long periods.

One of the keys to Berkshire Hathaway's success is its dividend-friendly investment portfolio. While Berkshire doesn't pay its shareholders a dividend Buffett's company is on track to collect more than $6 billion in passive income over the next 12 months including preferred dividends. Companies that pay a dividend are typically profitable and time-tested. They've also handily outperformed their non-dividend-paying peers over multiple decades.

Warren Buffett has packed Berkshire's investment portfolio with cyclical businesses as well. Even though recessions are inevitable the Oracle of Omaha is keenly aware that periods of expansion last considerably longer. With over 90% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets tied up in four cyclically oriented sectors Buffett has positioned his company to take advantage of the natural expansion of the U.S. and global economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYWFzdG9ja3MuY29tL2VuL3N0b2Nrcy9hbmFseXNpcy9zdG9jay1hYWZuLWNvbi8wMTM2MS9ISzYvTk9XLjExOTMyOTMvaGstc3RvY2stbmV3c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sportswears Broadly Buoyant; LI NING ANTA SPORTS Rocket 10-11%,"SITEMAP

Most Anticipated New Releases Coming to Netflix This Week

Blasted (2022)

Coming to Netflix: Tuesday

Given Stranger Things headlines the lineup this week we’re a little light on other big Netflix Originals but one that could potentially break through the noise is this new Norweigen sci-fi movie.

Inspired by a UFO phenomenon in Hessdalen the movie first announced in May 2021 here’s what you can expect from the action-comedy:

“Blasted follows childhood friends Sebastian (Axel Bøyum) and Mikkel (Fredrik Skogsrud) who are reunited for Sebastian’s bachelor party. While Mikkel never matured past teenage laser tag-prodigy Sebastian has grown into a career-obsessed workaholic who’s using the party to schmooze a potential client. But when the bachelor party stumbles head-first into an alien invasion it’s up to Mikkel and Sebastian to reunite as the kick-ass lasertag duo they once were and fight back.”

First of the Month Movies

As always the first of the month means a refresh in terms of licensed movies from third-party providers like Warner Bros. Sony Universal and others. If we had to pick three movies for you to check out we’d recommend:

A Call to Spy – “After France falls to the Nazis two women seek to support the war effort by spying for a secret agency under Churchill. Based on a true story.”

I Am Legend (2007) – “When a virus turns the human race into bloodthirsty mutants civilization’s last hope is scientist Robert Neville — the only person left unaffected.”

– “When a virus turns the human race into bloodthirsty mutants civilization’s last hope is scientist Robert Neville — the only person left unaffected.” Zero Dark Thirty (2012) – “Helmed by Kathryn Bigelow this gripping dramatization chronicles the 10-year hunt for Osama bin Laden in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.”

Mr John Akaribo a peasant farmer at Vea in the Bolgatanga Municipality said Apart from the increase in cost of fertilizer traction cost has also increased at a time that farmers are preparing their lands for cropping.

Mr John Akaribo a peasant farmer at Vea in the Bolgatanga Municipality said for the past two years he had cultivated five hectares of rice but due to ill health and the high cost of farm inputs he could only cultivate two acres this year.

He noted that rice cultivation required so much fertilizer without which one could not get a good harvest.

Mr Akaribo who spoke to the Ghana News Agency in an interview in Bolgatanga lamented over current prices of farm inputs and feared that farmers whose farms were yet to be ploughed would pay higher for the service due to the increase in fuel prices and high demand for tractor services as the rains increased.

He expressed shock at the current state of agriculture in the country saying “if agriculture is the backbone of our economy it should be detached from politics for it to thrive” he stressed.

He explained that this year he and his colleague farmers were shifting from fertilizer intensified crops to sorghum and soya bean which did not need so much fertilizer and had a good market.

Mr Samuel Abiayega a rice farmer and once a regional award winner at the Fumbisi rice valleys in the Builsa South District said he had reduced his rice farm from 260 hectares to 100 hectares to enable him concentrate on soya beans which did not require much fertilizer.

He said the challenge of buying fertilizer was a daunting one and noted that last year some subsidized fertilizer was sold for GH¢ 80 while others went for GH¢ 205 and in 2022 the same was being sold at GH¢150 for 25 kg and GH¢320 for the 50kg.

He said the Yara Activa fertilizer was currently being sold at GH¢400 per bag and added that it was the quantum of fertilizer needed to cultivate per acre that made it difficult for them to afford.

He said chemicals used for the preparation of the farms after broadcasting rice seeds to control the weeds were sold between GH¢18.00 to GH¢20.00 last year but presently cost between GH¢50.00 to GH¢70.00

He also noted that farm hands charged by day from between GH¢20 to GH¢30 last year but had increased it to GH¢50 and GH¢60 this year 2022.

Mr Isaac Pabia the Regional Chairman of the Peasant farmers Association of Ghana said in an interview said though there was fertilizer in the system the prices were too high and that was deterring the farmers from accessing it.

He said members of the association have been encouraged to explore other means of fertilizing their farms such as using organic fertilizer either in granular or liquid form.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9jb21tdW5pdGllcy11cmdlZC10by1wcm92aWRlLWFjY29tbW9kYXRpb24tZm9yLXRlYWNoZXJzL9IBUWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9jb21tdW5pdGllcy11cmdlZC10by1wcm92aWRlLWFjY29tbW9kYXRpb24tZm9yLXRlYWNoZXJzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Communities urged to provide accommodation for teachers,"Ms Mercy Akua Lissar the Assin Fosu Municipal Education Director has appealed to chiefs opinion leaders philanthropists and institutions to help provide accommodation for teachers posted to rural areas.

She noted that the unavailability of decent accommodation in some communities has compelled teachers to live outside making supervision of the children challenging.

Ms Lissar made the appeal when the Assin Fosu Municipal Education Directorate celebrated its Education Week on the theme “Enhancing Quality Education Through Stakeholders Engagements.”

She also appealed to teachers to adjust and manage to live closer to where they work until better accommodation was provided to raise the standards of discipline in schools.

Ms Lissar further appealed to all stakeholders to help put up good habitable for school staff in rural areas to motivate them to accept postings to those areas.

Ms Lissar noted that 76 per cent of students in the Municipality performed well in the West Africa Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE) in 2021 as compared to 56 per cent in 2020.

She attributed that to some firm mechanisms that the directorate put in place to promote quality education in the municipal.

In addition she said heads of schools were made to sign performance contract agreements to ensure things were well structured for good results.

Rev. Dr. John Kwame Apenkwa Brown the head pastor of Lighthouse Chapel stressed the need for teachers to upgrade their knowledge to provide the necessary teaching competencies to meet the standard of education worldwide.

Nana Agyapong Ntrada II chief of Assin Brofoyedru called on the students to desist from hunting mushrooms and snails during school hours but prioritize education to secure a better future.

He appealed to stakeholders philanthropists and others to come to their aid to help build accommodation for teachers.

In attendance was Mr. Nicholas Fiifi Baako the Municipal Chief Executive and other heads of departments.",,,,,,,,,

The chaotic mix of record fuel prices and an unending supply chain crisis have retailers considering the unthinkable: Instead of returning your unwanted items just keep them.

In recent weeks some of the biggest store chains including Target (TGT) Walmart (WMT) Gap (GPS) American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and others have reported in their latest earnings calls that they have too much inventory of stuff ranging from workout clothes spring-time jackets and hoodies to garden furniture and bulky kids’ toys. It’s costing them tons of money to store it.

Now add on to that glut another category of product that stores have to deal with: returns.

So instead of piling returned merchandise onto this growing inventory heap stores are considering just handing customers their money back and letting them hang onto the stuff they don’t want.

goTRG processes more than 100 million units of returned items annually. Stephen Ironside/goTRG

“It would be a smart strategic initiative” said Burt Flickinger retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. “Retailers are stuck with excess inventory of unprecedented levels. They can’t afford to take back even more of it.”

Returned products are handled in a number of different ways he said. Retailers take back merchandise from the customer evaluate it and if it’s in good condition put it back on the shelf at the same or lesser price.

They can refurbish damaged returns and sell them for less or offload them to liquidators to resell. They also can sell returned products to foreign liquidators for sale in Europe Canada or Mexico.

“Given the situation at the ports and the container shortages sending product overseas isn’t really an option” said Flickinger. Lastly retailers can hire third party firms to handle all aspect of merchandise returns for them.

Each of these options however tack on additional costs for retailers he said.

“For every dollar in sales a retailer’s net profit is between a cent to five cents. With returns for every dollar in returned merchandise it costs a retailer between 15 cents to 30 cents to handle it” said Flickinger.

There is one other option for retailers to address returns while avoiding more product bloat and that’s to consider a ‘returnless return’ said Steve Rop chief operating officer with goTRG a firm that processes over 100 million returned items annually for companies like Wal-Mart Amazon and Lowe’s.

Just keep it

Rop said his company’s clients are 100% considering offering the “keep it” option for returns this year although he wouldn’t disclose if any of his customers have implemented the “Keep it” returns policy yet.

In some instances when they determine it would be easier some retailers advise customers to just keep or donate their return after issuing a refund. Walmart said it had nothing to share at this time. Lowe’s didn’t provide a comment for the story.

“They’re already discounting in stores to clear out products but when there’s heavy discounting buyer’s remorse goes up. People are tempted to buy a lot to only return it later” he said.

Refunding customers while simultaneously letting them keep their returns isn’t a new practice said Rop. “It started with Amazon several years ago” he said.

The offer makes sense for some types of products – lower price-tier bulky items like furniture kitchen appliances home decor baby chairs walkers strollers where it’s costly for the retailer to cover the shipping cost for the return.

“Other products like kids’ toys footwear towels and bedding raise sanitary concerns when it comes to returns. It could also apply to these categories” he said.

Another concern with cheaper items: Stores typically discount returned products so the amount of money they can make on an inexpensive return is miniscule – and may not be worth the tradeoff says Keith Daniels partner with Carl Marks Advisors.

Still a “keep it” policy has its own disadvantages namely: Companies will need to ensure that they don’t become victims of fraud.

“One thing retailers need to track and ensure is that customers that become aware of the [Keep it] policy do not begin to abuse it by seeking free merchandise over a series of orders by getting a refund but getting to keep the merchandise” said Daniels.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9jaGljYWdvLWhpc3RvcnktdGltZWxpbmUtcmV2aXNpdGluZy0xNzUteWVhcnMtb2YtYnJlYWtpbmctbmV3cy1mcm9tLXRoZS1wYWdlcy1vZi10aGUtY2hpY2Fnby10cmlidW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chicago history timeline: Revisiting 175 years of breaking news from the pages of the Chicago Tribune – Chicago ...,"Since its first edition was published on June 10 1847 the Chicago Tribune has covered every milestone in the city’s history.

If you ask Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane the name of its entrepreneurial founder (and cornflake creator) W.K. Kellogg will live on via consumer packages — even if it goes away on a corporate masthead.

""The Kellogg name is incredibly important"" Cahillane told Yahoo Finance Live last week.

""It stands for so many things and all of them good and started 116 years ago by Mr. Kellogg. This great company has done some tremendous things and his name lives on on cereal boxes and food items around the globe.""

Last Tuesday the food giant announced the company's three segments will venture out on their own to ""unleash growth"" as Cahillane put it.

These units will be divided into: Global Snacking Co. which has $11.4 billion in net sales; North America Cereal Co. which has about $2.4 billion in sales; and Plant Co. which has $340 million in sales.

All three businesses are currently profitable Kellogg noted in a press release.

""We haven't decided yet [on names]"" Cahillane said. ""I wouldn't dismiss the opportunity for Mr. Kellogg's name to continue to carry on on one of the three companies [being created] or more. We're doing the work to understand exactly what speaks to our employees what harkens back to the heritage the rich tradition and pays the right level of respect and homage to one of the great entrepreneurs of our time.""

Cahillane plans to run the snacking business given his specific expertise with appointments for the other two business leaders expected later. Kellogg didn't rule out a potential sale of its plant-based food business at some point. A completion of the reorganization is slated for sometime in 2023.

""It was an extraordinarily weighty decision to say the least — a 116-year tradition started by Mr. Kellogg"" Cahillane who has been CEO since 2017 conceded.

Kellogg stock has gained about 4% since unveiling the corporate overhaul.

Wall Street had mixed views on Kellogg's breakup.

Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English lifted his price target on Kellogg to $76 from $70.

CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram maintained a sell rating on the stock however.

""Spin-offs like this don't always add shareholder value in our opinion as they typically create dis-synergies stranded costs and other inefficiencies at least over the near to medium term"" Sundaram said in a note to clients.

The move by Kellogg's comes as the food manufacturer has seen improved momentum in the face of supply chain challenges and bruising inflation.

Story continues

Kellogg's first quarter organic net sales rose 4.2% from a year ago while adjusted operating profits gained 13.3%. Sales were paced by brands such as Pringles Cheez-Its and Eggo waffles while the namesake cereal business grew at a slower pace.

The company also raised its full-year earnings growth guidance to a range of 1% to 2% from 1% previously.

Washington Square Park was brimming with incensed pro-choice advocates Friday evening before the throng headed north through Midtown around 9 p.m. stopping at Grand Central Station Times Square and Bryant Park.

One cop estimated there were 17000 people in the crowd. Many were holding signs that said “Keep your laws off my body” and “No uterus no opinion” while shouting chants like “My body my choice.”

During the march the crowd made a stop at the News Corp building on 6th Avenue which is home to Fox News and The New York Post.

“Burn it down! Burn it down! F–k Tucker Carlson!” the crowd yelled outside the News Corp building.

“F– you!” they yelled at a pair of security guards.

Someone from the crowd also spraypainted “F—k Fox” on the side of the building.

Nearby a protester appears to have broken a window and poured an unknown liquid on the floor at the Women’s National Republican Club on 51st street photos show.

NYPD could not immediately confirm the incident but a marked police cruiser was parked outside of the club.

The crowd ended its crusade at Bryant Park where several people were arrested around 11 p.m. as they blocked traffic on 42nd Street and The Avenue of the Americas. The Post counted at least a dozen individuals who were detained by police.

They had sat themselves down cross-legged in the middle of the crosswalk as a police officer warned them that they would be arrested and charged with disorderly conduct if they did not leave. In response three women took their shirts off completely topless.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” the crowd chanted as cops put zip ties around the protesters’ hands.

Moments later two others were also arrested.

Several other protesters were seen blocking a Harlem-bound M7 bus with one climbing on the windshield and twerking. Another protester pretended to collapse in front of the bus.

Later protesters threw something at a passing police car as dozens remained in the street blocking traffic.

“F–k 12!” a man yelled at a driver of a yellow Porsche after surrounding the car.

About four or five people were seen jumping onto the flatbed of an 18-wheeler as it drove up 6th Avenue. Moments later a phalanx of cops descended and arrested another handful of protesters.

Those arrested included a man in a “F–k Fox News” t-shirt and two tourists from Estonia.

At the park a woman who identified herself as Elizabeth from the Party of Socialist Liberation speaking in front of a stage told the crowd “The Supreme Court needs to be abolished” and called for “a summer of rage.”

In Washington D.C. another large protest on Capitol Hill was mostly peaceful with the exception of some back and forth shoving between protesters and cops and an American flag that was set on fire in the street.

The protesters many clad in black and carrying opened black umbrellas marched past the DC courthouse Metropolitan Police headquarters chanting “burn the precinct to the ground.” A group at the front of the march held a large banner that read “They cannot control our bodies.”

“F—k Judge Thomas” they chanted at one point.

The crowd returned to the Supreme Court building without spray painting or vandalizing any property.

Across the county in Los Angeles protesters took over the LA Freeway before they were dispersed by police according to posts on the Citizen app. Video shows the crowd chanting as they march down the highway. Other gatherings were reported in other parts of the city as well.

More officers were seen sprinting towards the intersection as tensions rose between cops and protesters.

Moments later an LAFD ambulance arrived on the scene. The area was shut down for about an hour before police said it was cleared. Police said “no incidents were reported.”

In Phoenix people were sent screaming and running after police officers fired tear gas from inside of the capitol at the crowds on the front lawn video shows.

“It was kind of scary because I thought they were shooting flares at us” one protester in Pheonix told The Post. “It got all smokey it was hard to breathe for a little. We were literally just yelling at people inside the building.”

At a seemingly peaceful rally in Cedar Rapids Iowa a truck ran into pro-choice protesters after a verbal altercation sending one woman to the hospital.

The incident happened near the city’s courthouse around 7:20 p.m. according to KCRG-TV and was partially caught on camera. Video shows the pickup truck was seen driving at a slow speed as two people pressed against its front hood and ran backward to avoid being run over.

Other major U.S. cities such as Chicago Boston and Philadelphia saw their streets packed with thousands of protesters enraged that over 40 million women across at least 26 states are expected to be banned from getting an abortion.

While the high court’s decision to uphold the Mississippi law challenging Roe does not outlaw abortion it does hand regulatory power to state governments."
NWS,News Corp,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9idXNpbmVzcy9yZXRhaWwtcmV0dXJucy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gE6aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9idXNpbmVzcy9yZXRhaWwtcmV0dXJucw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Just keep your returns: Stores weigh paying you not to bring back unwanted items,"New York CNNBusiness —

The chaotic mix of record fuel prices and an unending supply chain crisis have retailers considering the unthinkable: Instead of returning your unwanted items just keep them.

In recent weeks some of the biggest store chains including Target (TGT) Walmart (WMT) Gap (GPS) American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and others have reported in their latest earnings calls that they have too much inventory of stuff ranging from workout clothes spring-time jackets and hoodies to garden furniture and bulky kids’ toys. It’s costing them tons of money to store it.

Now add on to that glut another category of product that stores have to deal with: returns.

So instead of piling returned merchandise onto this growing inventory heap stores are considering just handing customers their money back and letting them hang onto the stuff they don’t want.

goTRG processes more than 100 million units of returned items annually. Stephen Ironside/goTRG

“It would be a smart strategic initiative” said Burt Flickinger retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. “Retailers are stuck with excess inventory of unprecedented levels. They can’t afford to take back even more of it.”

Returned products are handled in a number of different ways he said. Retailers take back merchandise from the customer evaluate it and if it’s in good condition put it back on the shelf at the same or lesser price.

They can refurbish damaged returns and sell them for less or offload them to liquidators to resell. They also can sell returned products to foreign liquidators for sale in Europe Canada or Mexico.

“Given the situation at the ports and the container shortages sending product overseas isn’t really an option” said Flickinger. Lastly retailers can hire third party firms to handle all aspect of merchandise returns for them.

Each of these options however tack on additional costs for retailers he said.

“For every dollar in sales a retailer’s net profit is between a cent to five cents. With returns for every dollar in returned merchandise it costs a retailer between 15 cents to 30 cents to handle it” said Flickinger.

There is one other option for retailers to address returns while avoiding more product bloat and that’s to consider a ‘returnless return’ said Steve Rop chief operating officer with goTRG a firm that processes over 100 million returned items annually for companies like Wal-Mart Amazon and Lowe’s.

Just keep it

Rop said his company’s clients are 100% considering offering the “keep it” option for returns this year although he wouldn’t disclose if any of his customers have implemented the “Keep it” returns policy yet.

In some instances when they determine it would be easier some retailers advise customers to just keep or donate their return after issuing a refund. Walmart said it had nothing to share at this time. Lowe’s didn’t provide a comment for the story.

“They’re already discounting in stores to clear out products but when there’s heavy discounting buyer’s remorse goes up. People are tempted to buy a lot to only return it later” he said.

Refunding customers while simultaneously letting them keep their returns isn’t a new practice said Rop. “It started with Amazon several years ago” he said.

The offer makes sense for some types of products – lower price-tier bulky items like furniture kitchen appliances home decor baby chairs walkers strollers where it’s costly for the retailer to cover the shipping cost for the return.

“Other products like kids’ toys footwear towels and bedding raise sanitary concerns when it comes to returns. It could also apply to these categories” he said.

Another concern with cheaper items: Stores typically discount returned products so the amount of money they can make on an inexpensive return is miniscule – and may not be worth the tradeoff says Keith Daniels partner with Carl Marks Advisors.

Still a “keep it” policy has its own disadvantages namely: Companies will need to ensure that they don’t become victims of fraud.

“One thing retailers need to track and ensure is that customers that become aware of the [Keep it] policy do not begin to abuse it by seeking free merchandise over a series of orders by getting a refund but getting to keep the merchandise” said Daniels.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9jaGljYWdvLWhpc3RvcnktdGltZWxpbmUtcmV2aXNpdGluZy0xNzUteWVhcnMtb2YtYnJlYWtpbmctbmV3cy1mcm9tLXRoZS1wYWdlcy1vZi10aGUtY2hpY2Fnby10cmlidW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chicago history timeline: Revisiting 175 years of breaking news from the pages of the Chicago Tribune – Chicago ...,"Since its first edition was published on June 10 1847 the Chicago Tribune has covered every milestone in the city’s history.

If you ask Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane the name of its entrepreneurial founder (and cornflake creator) W.K. Kellogg will live on via consumer packages — even if it goes away on a corporate masthead.

""The Kellogg name is incredibly important"" Cahillane told Yahoo Finance Live last week.

""It stands for so many things and all of them good and started 116 years ago by Mr. Kellogg. This great company has done some tremendous things and his name lives on on cereal boxes and food items around the globe.""

Last Tuesday the food giant announced the company's three segments will venture out on their own to ""unleash growth"" as Cahillane put it.

These units will be divided into: Global Snacking Co. which has $11.4 billion in net sales; North America Cereal Co. which has about $2.4 billion in sales; and Plant Co. which has $340 million in sales.

All three businesses are currently profitable Kellogg noted in a press release.

""We haven't decided yet [on names]"" Cahillane said. ""I wouldn't dismiss the opportunity for Mr. Kellogg's name to continue to carry on on one of the three companies [being created] or more. We're doing the work to understand exactly what speaks to our employees what harkens back to the heritage the rich tradition and pays the right level of respect and homage to one of the great entrepreneurs of our time.""

Cahillane plans to run the snacking business given his specific expertise with appointments for the other two business leaders expected later. Kellogg didn't rule out a potential sale of its plant-based food business at some point. A completion of the reorganization is slated for sometime in 2023.

""It was an extraordinarily weighty decision to say the least — a 116-year tradition started by Mr. Kellogg"" Cahillane who has been CEO since 2017 conceded.

Kellogg stock has gained about 4% since unveiling the corporate overhaul.

Wall Street had mixed views on Kellogg's breakup.

Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English lifted his price target on Kellogg to $76 from $70.

CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram maintained a sell rating on the stock however.

""Spin-offs like this don't always add shareholder value in our opinion as they typically create dis-synergies stranded costs and other inefficiencies at least over the near to medium term"" Sundaram said in a note to clients.

The move by Kellogg's comes as the food manufacturer has seen improved momentum in the face of supply chain challenges and bruising inflation.

Story continues

Kellogg's first quarter organic net sales rose 4.2% from a year ago while adjusted operating profits gained 13.3%. Sales were paced by brands such as Pringles Cheez-Its and Eggo waffles while the namesake cereal business grew at a slower pace.

The company also raised its full-year earnings growth guidance to a range of 1% to 2% from 1% previously.

Washington Square Park was brimming with incensed pro-choice advocates Friday evening before the throng headed north through Midtown around 9 p.m. stopping at Grand Central Station Times Square and Bryant Park.

One cop estimated there were 17000 people in the crowd. Many were holding signs that said “Keep your laws off my body” and “No uterus no opinion” while shouting chants like “My body my choice.”

During the march the crowd made a stop at the News Corp building on 6th Avenue which is home to Fox News and The New York Post.

“Burn it down! Burn it down! F–k Tucker Carlson!” the crowd yelled outside the News Corp building.

“F– you!” they yelled at a pair of security guards.

Someone from the crowd also spraypainted “F—k Fox” on the side of the building.

Nearby a protester appears to have broken a window and poured an unknown liquid on the floor at the Women’s National Republican Club on 51st street photos show.

NYPD could not immediately confirm the incident but a marked police cruiser was parked outside of the club.

The crowd ended its crusade at Bryant Park where several people were arrested around 11 p.m. as they blocked traffic on 42nd Street and The Avenue of the Americas. The Post counted at least a dozen individuals who were detained by police.

They had sat themselves down cross-legged in the middle of the crosswalk as a police officer warned them that they would be arrested and charged with disorderly conduct if they did not leave. In response three women took their shirts off completely topless.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” the crowd chanted as cops put zip ties around the protesters’ hands.

Moments later two others were also arrested.

Several other protesters were seen blocking a Harlem-bound M7 bus with one climbing on the windshield and twerking. Another protester pretended to collapse in front of the bus.

Later protesters threw something at a passing police car as dozens remained in the street blocking traffic.

“F–k 12!” a man yelled at a driver of a yellow Porsche after surrounding the car.

About four or five people were seen jumping onto the flatbed of an 18-wheeler as it drove up 6th Avenue. Moments later a phalanx of cops descended and arrested another handful of protesters.

Those arrested included a man in a “F–k Fox News” t-shirt and two tourists from Estonia.

At the park a woman who identified herself as Elizabeth from the Party of Socialist Liberation speaking in front of a stage told the crowd “The Supreme Court needs to be abolished” and called for “a summer of rage.”

In Washington D.C. another large protest on Capitol Hill was mostly peaceful with the exception of some back and forth shoving between protesters and cops and an American flag that was set on fire in the street.

The protesters many clad in black and carrying opened black umbrellas marched past the DC courthouse Metropolitan Police headquarters chanting “burn the precinct to the ground.” A group at the front of the march held a large banner that read “They cannot control our bodies.”

“F—k Judge Thomas” they chanted at one point.

The crowd returned to the Supreme Court building without spray painting or vandalizing any property.

Across the county in Los Angeles protesters took over the LA Freeway before they were dispersed by police according to posts on the Citizen app. Video shows the crowd chanting as they march down the highway. Other gatherings were reported in other parts of the city as well.

In Downtown LA video shows protesters setting off fireworks as they clash with LAPD officers.

Protesters could be seen exchanging shoves with police in tactical gear at the intersection of Main St. and Fifth Street video from KTLA reporter Andre Tinoco shows.

More officers were seen sprinting towards the intersection as tensions rose between cops and protesters.

Moments later an LAFD ambulance arrived on the scene. The area was shut down for about an hour before police said it was cleared. Police said “no incidents were reported.”

In Phoenix people were sent screaming and running after police officers fired tear gas from inside of the capitol at the crowds on the front lawn video shows.

“It was kind of scary because I thought they were shooting flares at us” one protester in Pheonix told The Post. “It got all smokey it was hard to breathe for a little. We were literally just yelling at people inside the building.”

At a seemingly peaceful rally in Cedar Rapids Iowa a truck ran into pro-choice protesters after a verbal altercation sending one woman to the hospital.

The incident happened near the city’s courthouse around 7:20 p.m. according to KCRG-TV and was partially caught on camera. Video shows the pickup truck was seen driving at a slow speed as two people pressed against its front hood and ran backward to avoid being run over.

Other major U.S. cities such as Chicago Boston and Philadelphia saw their streets packed with thousands of protesters enraged that over 40 million women across at least 26 states are expected to be banned from getting an abortion.

While the high court’s decision to uphold the Mississippi law challenging Roe does not outlaw abortion it does hand regulatory power to state governments."

Gemunu Amarasinghe / AP

JPMorgan Chase the largest bank in America and two athletic apparel giants with a significant presence in the Northwest have joined a host of companies saying they will cover the cost for employees who need to travel out of state for abortions.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday officially reversed Roe v. Wade declaring that the constitutional right to abortion upheld for nearly a half century no longer exists.

Without federal protection states are now responsible for codifying their own laws surrounding abortion. Some have already passed laws banning nearly all abortions.

JP Morgan told employees in a memo that if they live in states where abortion is outlawed the company will cover the cost of travel to a state where it’s legal beginning in July.

Nike and Adidas have also issued statements saying they’ll help employees access abortion if the procedure is restricted where they live. While abortion access is still protected in Oregon the two companies also have employees in states where abortion will now be banned or severely restricted.

Nike which is headquartered near Beaverton says abortion is covered in its family planning benefits. The athletic apparel giant says it will cover travel and lodging expenses for employees who can’t access services nearby.

Portland is home to the North American headquarters of Adidas which offered an even more specific commitment to its U.S. employees in a statement released Friday.

“Our comprehensive medical plans will continue to cover reproductive resources like contraception and abortion support pregnancy fertility and other family planning and building services” Adidas said in an emailed statement. “Where availability of abortion services may not be accessible close to home our plan now covers travel and lodging expenses up to $10000 per occurrence for all U.S. employees enrolled in the plan.”

A statement from Oregon’s largest corporate employer Intel also signaled ongoing healthcare coverage for employees seeking abortions but its statement was more cautious and vague.

“Our U.S. healthcare options cover a wide range of medical treatments including abortion where permitted as part of our overall family planning benefits” the statement said. “Intel will continue to provide resources for those who need to travel for safe timely healthcare.”

After the initial statement from JP Morgan numerous companies issued statements and internal memos to employees. They include:

Disney

Paramount

Netflix

Condé Nast

Meta

Warner Bros

Comcast

Sony

Intuit

BuzzFeed

Duolingo

Dick's Sporting Goods

These companies join a previous wave of corporations that had made similar announcements after a Supreme Court opinion leaked in early May suggesting this outcome.

""Access to reproductive health care including abortion has been a critical factor to the workplace gains and contributions women have made over the past 50 years"" a May 4 statement from Levi's said.

Media company Condé Nast said it will pay for travel and lodging costs if employees need to travel out of their state for an abortion according to an internal memo from CEO Roger Lynch to employees of the publisher of Vogue New Yorker and Vanity Fair among others.

""It is a crushing blow to reproductive rights that have been protected for nearly half a century"" Lynch said in the memo obtained by NPR.

Condé Nast said the company has made enhancements to its U.S. health benefits to help employees and their dependents get access to reproductive care regardless of where they reside.

Lynch went further in his email to exhort his employees to use their journalism to respond in this moment.

""The most powerful way for us to respond to what's happening right now is through our brands and the distinctive editorial lenses with which they're covering today's news and the effect it will have on society"" he said. ""Our values are clear in the content and journalism we produce.""

Originally released around the same time as other ‘college’ colourways that is Nike Dunk Lows with solid panelling overlays set over a white midsole and underlay the shoe has become a favourite for its ‘go with anything colour’.

“The train is hoping to be moved in the next 10 to 15 minutes” Lieutenant Clint Riner stated.

From The Tribune staff reports

TRUSSVILLE — A Norfolk Southern train has reportedly broken down this morning and has caused some delays.

According to the Trussville Police Department (TPD) Lieutenant Clint Riner said three intersections two Stockton crossings and Camp Coleman Road were reportedly blocked. Norfolk Southern has broken the train in half at Bethune Parkway crossings and an alternate route has been opened for Camp Coleman Road.

“Off Camp Coleman Road the chicken plant has opened their back gate” Riner said. “The train was broken at Stockton so there’s access for all three intersections.”

Riner said that Norfolk Southen did not have a timeline for when the train would be moved.

Representative Danny Garrett filed a bill on January 13 2022 stating that it “would provide that except for trains stopped due to mechanical failure where separation or movement is not possible and except for trains stopped as required by federal law any train that has come to a complete stop and is blocking a railroad-highway grade crossing shall be cut separated or moved to clear the crossing upon the approach of any authorized emergency vehicle.”

The bill passed the house with a 95 to 1 vote but it did not make it out of the Senate.

“It passed the House which meant that it went to the Senate but it never came out of the committee and Senate” Garrett said. “It died and now we’ll have to start over next session.”

The Trussville Tribune has reached out to Norfolk Southern but has not received a comment or any additional information at the time of publication.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL3NoZWlsYS1icmFkeS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNTM3NDYyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sheila Brady Obituary (2022) - Norfolk VA - The Virginian-Pilot,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pilotonline/name/sheila-brady-obituary?id=35374624 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL3NoZWlsYS1icmFkeS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNTM3NDYyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvYWxsaWdhdG9yLWtpbGxzLXBlcnNvbi1pbi1zYy1yZXRlbnRpb24tcG9uZC1wb2xpY2Utc2F5L2FydGljbGVfYTY3YjE1MmMtYzljZi01YzZlLTg3MTQtYmY1NTJjNTQ0YmRiLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alligator kills person in SC retention pond police say,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.fox13memphis.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/trending/alligator-kills-person-in-sc-retention-pond-police-say/article_a67b152c-c9cf-5c6e-8714-bf552c544bdb.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000029D48E11F60>, 'Connection to www.fox13memphis.com timed out.

The affected states are Sokoto Kebbi and Zamfara.

The chief veterinary officer of the federation Dr. Maimuna Habibu Saturday said the reported cases of locusts’ invasion were particularly recorded in Zamfara and Kebbi states.

Dr Habibu said the ministry has already deployed officers to begin aerial attacks against the locusts in the affected states.

Trust CEO Rob Tarn wants DfE funding so other schools can follow North Shore Academy's lead in launching attendance networks

A government attendance adviser has urged the Department for Education to fund dozens more “attendance hubs”.

Rob Tarn the chief executive of the Northern Education Trust was appointed to the DfE’s “attendance action alliance” of expert advisers last year.

One trust school in a highly deprived area North Shore Academy in Stockton-on-Tees was also invited to do a DfE webinar last year after achieving 93 per cent attendance.

This prompted Tarn to launch an “attendance hub” network pilot in May – which he now wants replicated nationwide.

“If you could bring schools together every month with similar challenges and communities and all you did was share best practice as professionals who are peers and equals maybe we’d start to get somewhere” he said at the recent Confederation of School Trusts conference.

Many hubs conferences and programmes focused on behaviour leadership and outcomes but there had never been “networking or partnerships” for attendance.

The trust received 250 requests to join but it has capped numbers at 58. Tarn said its approach at North Shore was no “magic bullet” and might only work in areas with a similar demographic.

Rob Tarn

He hoped to help the DfE and other schools launch their own partnerships with “30 partnerships of 50 schools each”.

He has asked the DfE to fund a co-ordinator for any new hubs or “a few grand” for participating staff. His own staff have spent “hundreds of hours” building resources.

Michael Robson an executive principal leading the pilot said North Shore had five learning managers an education welfare officer an attendance officer and a safeguarding and wellbeing officer.

Pupils who had “lost their way” spent half a term in a “personalised learning centre”  studying the curriculum and doing a “social action project”.

The school was “really clear” about “red line behaviours” that were not tolerated although pupils were offered support.

Tarn said “processes and protocol” an “obsessive” approach and a culture where pupils felt “safe aspirant successful and want to come to school” were key.

The hubs included attendance dashboards vulnerable student registers discussions at every leadership meeting “attendance hero” certificates and daily staff visits to some homes.

Tarn said other trust schools subsidised the large pastoral team at North Shore.",,,,,,,,,

(NYSE: NOC) several contracts related to its MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft system. The program is based in Rancho Bernardo. The deals cover fatigue testing as well as the aircraft’s intelligence-collecting payloads.

The first is a $40.7 million order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement. The order provides Full Scale Fatigue Test (FSFT) and Effects of Defects (EoD) for the Triton to include testing analyzing and documenting the results of both the FSFT and EoD test as well as identifying post-test activities in order to fully verify and validate the fatigue and damage tolerance requirement of the performance based system specification. Some 81.2% of the work will be performed in San Diego with another 11.3% in Wichita Kansas. Work is expected to be completed by February 2028.

The Navy also awarded Northrop Grumman a $15.4 million order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement. This order provides product supportability analyses for aircraft operational level maintenance task analysis and provisioning data in support of IFC-4 configured aircraft. IFC-4 refers to the multi-intelligence configuration that meets the Navy’s critical maritime intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and targeting needs; the abbreviation IFC stands for integrated functional capability. The contract benefits both the Navy and the government of Australia. Work will be performed in Rancho Bernardo and is expected to be completed in November 2024.

Separately Northrop Grumman received a $15.1 million modification to a previously awarded contract. The deal provides additional labor and material to incorporate production engineering change proposals that modify MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft system production assets to IFC-4 for the Navy and Australia. Some 92.5% of the work will be performed in San Diego with the balance in Medford New York; Newton North Dakota; and various locations within the continental United States. Work is expected to be completed in April 2025.

The Naval Air Systems Command of Patuxent River Maryland awarded the three contracts announced on May 26 June 10 and June 15.

Leidos to Support Anti-Submarine Warfare

The U.S. Navy awarded Leidos Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) a contract worth slightly less than $24 million for anti-submarine warfare equipment: specifically shipset hardware installation integrated logistic support fleet maintenance support and lifecycle sustainment of the Navy’s AN/SQQ-89 Surface Ship Undersea Warfare combat systems. This contract includes options which if exercised would bring the cumulative value to $292 million. This contract combines purchases for the Navy (98%); and the governments of Australia (1%) and Japan (1%) under the Foreign Military Sales program. Some 28% of the contract worth approximately $6.7 million will be performed in San Diego and is expected to be completed by May 2023. If all options are exercised work will continue through May 2027. This contract was competitively procured via the beta.sam.gov website with one offer received. The Naval Sea Systems Command of Washington D.C. awarded the contract announced on May 26.

Now based in Virginia Leidos traces its roots to the original SAIC a company founded in San Diego in 1969.

Cubic and Carley to Train Sailors

San Diego-based Cubic Corporation announced on June 2 that it received a subcontract from Carley Corporation under Carley’s prime contract for the U.S. Navy’s Sailor 2025 Ready Relevant Learning (RRL) Fiscal Year 2022 Content Conversion.

No value was given for the indefinite quantity indefinite delivery deal. Cubic will perform its work in Orlando Florida. Work and is expected to run through March 2027.

As part of the agreement with support from Cubic Carley will design develop and deliver modernized training content including courseware training products for multiple Navy ratings. The content will be provided to sailors over the course of their career-long learning continuum.

“It is an honor to continue to deliver modernized training content to our sailors at the point of need” said Mike Knowles president of Cubic Mission and Performance Solutions. “This is the third contract award for the collective Carley-Cubic team and demonstrates the Navy’s continued confidence in our ability to deliver operationally relevant training to our sailors and the fleet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS91ay1tb2Qtc3F1YXNoZXMtbW9zcXVpdG9zLWZsaWdodC1hbWJpdGlvbnMtYXMtaXQtYXhlcy0zMC1taWxsaW9uLXByb2plY3QvMTQ5MTcyLmFydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK MoD squashes Mosquito's flight ambitions as it axes £30 million project,"UK defence officials have cancelled the Project Mosquito ‘loyal wingman’ technology demonstrator being developed by a team including Spirit AeroSystems Belfast and Northrop Grumman to instead pursue smaller and cheaper alternatives.

One of several initiatives being explored by the Royal Air Force’s (RAF’s) Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) the Mosquito aircraft had been tentatively scheduled to fly in 2023.

However the Ministry of Defence (MoD) on 24 June announced that the project will not “proceed beyond the design phase”.

The MoD says the decision was “taken by mutual agreement with industry partners” and followed “a detailed review of the technical demonstrator and the broader Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) programme”.

It says analysis and capability experimentation carried out by the RAF and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) concluded that “more beneficial capability and cost-effectiveness appears achievable through exploration of smaller less costly but still highly capable additive capabilities”.

Air Commodore Jez Holmes head of the RCO insists that work on Project Mosquito has been worthwhile allowing the RAF to make “substantial progress” and gain “significant value in understanding and harnessing a range of future uncrewed capabilities”.

“This decision maximises the learning accrued to date and enables a change of direction for the LANCA programme” he says.

“The Rapid Capabilities Office will now quickly launch activities to aggressively pursue the RAF’s unchanged firm commitment to integrate advanced uncrewed capabilities into the near-term force mix with more immediate beneficial value.”

Investigation of loyal wingman concepts will still continue as part of the UK’s Future Combat Air System programme which is set to arrive post-2035 says the MoD.

Team Mosquito which includes Spirit AeroSystems Belfast Northrop Grumman Intrepid Minds and Dstl was awarded £30 million ($36 million) in early 2021 to advance the project to flight status.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L2RvZXMtbmV3LWdlcm1hbi1wYW50aGVyLXRhbmstaGF2ZS1mdXR1cmlzdGljLWZpcmVwb3dlci0yMDMyMTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does the New German Panther Tank Have Futuristic Firepower?,"It is unclear just how much the new tank rivals or surpasses the most current variants of the U.S. Army's Abrams battle tank.

The newly unveiled Rheinmetall KF51 Panther tank is reported to be built with a 130mm Future Gun System a weapon larger than the standard 120mm weapon used on the Abrams something which raises questions about the extent to which the new platform represents a technological advancement.

The tank appears to weave in new and more capable technologies. However it is unclear just how much the new tank rivals or surpasses the most current variants of the U.S. Army’s Abrams battle tank.

A recently published Popular Mechanics article said that “the new gun is a 130-millimeter/L52 gun meaning the barrel length is 52 times the diameter of the barrel. That comes out to 6760 millimeters or 22.1 feet long. The barrel is also fitted with a futuristic-looking shroud but it’s not clear how it contributes to the efficiency or effectiveness of the tank.”

Abrams developers explain they have developed the technology for “modular’ gun applications meaning a 130mm cannon could be added on as needed. Regarding lethality it seems significant that the article on the Panther does not mention ammunition as that is an area wherein there continues to be impactful innovations. The newer Abrams tanks have an ammunition data link. Not only are there things like delayed fuses for added penetrating effects proximity fuses for area detonation or “point-detonate” kinds of round but for many years the U.S. Army has been developing its advanced multi-purpose round for tanks. The round enables crews to decide the energetics or specific “blast effects.” It also combines three different kinds of munitions into a single round of ammunition which can be adjusted or programmed by tank gunners to achieve specific attack effects as needed by the mission. The AMP consolidates high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds multi-purpose anti-tank (MPAT) rounds canister rounds and obstacle reduction rounds into a single munition using new technology and an advanced ammunition data link.

The M830 HEAT round and the M830A1 MPAT round are the first two munitions to be consolidated. The M1028 canister round which is used to engage and defeat dismounted infantry is the third one being replaced. The canister round is effective against human-wave assaults with a scattering of small projectiles to increase anti-personnel lethality. The M908 Obstacle Reduction round which is designed to destroy large obstacles is the fourth included in the integration. Tank crews can choose which round effect to use through an ammunition data link according to documents from Northrop Grumman. The data link enables “direct communication from the tank fire control to the cartridge chambered in the breach” Northrop Grumman documents say. It uses a mechanical-electrical interface and “communication is enabled when the round is chambered and the tank is armed.”

The AMP round is capable of expanding the tactical attack envelope for tank crews quickly respond to different threat scenarios.

What Does All This Mean?

United Launch Alliance (ULA) is launching two spacecrafts for the U.S. Space Force’s Space Systems Command (SSC) and the Department of Defense (DoD). This mission will see the use of an Atlas V 541 launching from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida USA. On board of USSF-12 will be the Wide Field of View (WFOV) testbed for the SSC and the USSF-12 Ring spacecraft for the DoD’s Space Test Program (STP). Both satellites will be ferried directly into a geosynchronous orbit. This mission will mark ULA’s fourth launch in 2022 with OFT-2 being the third one back in May of 2022.

USSF-12

USSF-12’s primary payload is the U.S. Space Force’s SSC’s Wide Field of View (WFOV) testbed with a secondary payload for the DoD’s STP.

Wide Field of View (WFOV) Testbed

The WFOV testbed is an Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) technology demonstrator that will mature and prove the effectiveness of its 6-degree staring sensor called Wide-Area Six-Degree Payload (WASP). Developed by L3 Harris under a separate contract WASP will be able to observe nearly one third of Earth’s surface. WFOV will be capable of performing strategic and tactical missions such as battlespace awareness and missile warning and directly supporting warfighters by monitoring Earth’s surface respectively. With pathfinding the process to operationalize OPIR data the WFOV testbed will play an important role as part of the Missile Warning Tracking and Defense architecture.

The WFOV testbed is based on Millennium Space System’s Aquila M8 satellite bus. It has two deployable solar arrays offering a baseline payload power of 2500 W (options up to 10 kW) is powered by a bi-propellant propulsion system and single or dual string avionics. The Aquila M8 satellite bus is Millennium Space System’s biggest satellite bus in their line-up weighing ~3000 kg with a payload accommodation of over 350 kg. It’s designed to operate 3 to 5 years on orbit.

USSF-12 Ring Spacecraft

The secondary payload of the USSF-12 mission is an ESPA (EELV Secondary Payload Adapter) Star platform built by Northrop Grumman weighing 740-780 kg with room for up to six hosted or up to twelve deployable payloads. Each of the six payload slots is designed for payloads of around 320 kg (1920 kg in total). It has a four-panel deployable solar array providing 1200 W of power and a hydrazine based hypergolic propulsion system.

The USSF-12 Ring spacecraft is a classified mission that will demonstrate future technology for the DoD.

What Is The Atlas V?

The Atlas V is an expendable medium-lift launch system and member of the Atlas rocket family. The rocket has two stages. The first is a Common Core Booster (CCB) which is powered by a single RD-180 engine that burns kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen (LOx). This is accompanied by up to five strap-on solid rocket boosters (SRB). The second stage is the Centaur upper stage which is powered by one or two RL10 engines and burns liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) and liquid oxygen (LOx).

The CCB is 3.8 m (12.5 ft) in diameter and 32.5 m (106.5 ft) in length. This stage is capable of producing 3.83 MN (860200 lb) of thrust at sea level. Each SRB can provide additional 1.6 MN (371550 lb) of thrust. The Centaur second stage in turn is 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and 12.6 m (41.5 ft) in length and is capable of producing 101.8 kN (22900 lb) of thrust.

What Does 541 Mean?

Atlas V rockets have a three number configuration code. The first number represents the fairing diameter size in meters. The second number denotes the number of solid rocket motors (SRMs) which attach to the base of the rocket. The number of SRMs for a 4 meter fairing can range from 0 – 3. However the 5-meter fairing Atlas V can support up to 5 SRMs due to the different aerodynamic properties of the fairing. For the GOES-T mission there will be four SRM attached to the center core. The third number denotes the number of engines on the Centaur Upper Stage.

Nvidia Reflex is one of these a tool that helps to improve gameplay by lowering rendering lag and reducing system latency on GeForce graphics cards. This is the lag between in a first-person shooter such as Overwatch for example pressing your mouse button and the gun actually firing on-screen.

This might only reduce a delay of a few milliseconds but if you’re skilled enough for that to make a difference it could give you an additional advantage over your opponents.

I don’t see much chatter about this feature online and I can only assume that’s because fewer people care about latency than they do pretty graphics or smooth framerates. In fact a year or so ago I was also snubbing how much of a difference a tool can make to my gameplay compared to an actual hardware upgrade but while I eventually saw the benefits within competitive gaming or esports I recently found that my horizons were once again expanded.

Does Nvidia Reflex actually make a difference?

A screengrab of Nvidia Reflex benefits as told by...well Nvidia (Image credit: Nvidia)

I was invited to Reflex demonstration by Nvidia recently where I played 1-on-1 against a professional coach from Excel esports in Fortnite and Valorant switching between a gaming PC equipped with the latest generation of hardware and an older machine that had a few years behind it to simulate the kind of equipment that more of us are likely to have at home.

This older hardware also had its framerates capped and Reflex disabled in order to create a handicap. The intended goal was to see if my skills improved against the coach depending on the equipment I was running and if they in turn noticed a difference after playing between the two systems.

I’ll be brutally honest…at my skill level in shooting and Battle Royale games I couldn’t tell you if all those additional frames and low latency made a difference but that could be a comment on my own gaming skills more than anything.

This is a feature that will appeal to folks who play a lot of these competitive online titles and I’ve spoken rather candidly about how I avoid them because getting my ass handed to me by angry 14 years old boys isn’t an enjoyable way to spend my evenings but the coach (who understandably has a better insight into these things) assured me that the difference it made to their gameplay was like ‘night and day’ so we can assume that in professional hands Reflex does in fact make a difference to performance.

Not sure if its more humiliating losing to an AI or an edgy teenager to be honest (Image credit: Sony / Playstation)

There is one example where it was easier to notice on another game though: God of War was also on hand specifically a saved point of the game where you encounter the first Valkyrie Gunnr. This action/adventure title has very little in common with competitive online games but not only did I find this boss fight more enjoyable on the more capable system thanks to better graphics and framerate I also found it to be easier.

Could this be because Nvidia Reflex was enabled giving me a split-second advantage against my AI-controlled opponent? It's difficult to say given a plethora of other things could have contributed - a few additional rounds of practice switching between the two to name just one but if you understandably think I’m too poor of a competitive gamer to make a judgment on Nvidia Reflex you’re in luck: there’s essentially no downside to enabling it so you can try it yourself.

There's no alternative to hard work

I'd have to making gaming my full-time gig to improve my skills in Fortnite at this point (Image credit: Epic Games)

Having it running shouldn’t impact anything such as your framerate or cause stuttering so the only issue you’ll likely run into is that this feature has only been rolled out on a relatively modest selection of games so far. The full list can be found on the Nvidia website but most of the major competitive first-person shooters are featured such as Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare and Destiny 2.

As Nvidia Reflex is enabled in-game the process will vary depending on the title you’re playing but generally speaking you can find a way to enable and disable the feature within the ‘Video’ section of your game settings.

While originally introduced with the Nvidia Ampere 30 series GPUs Reflex has since been made available on older cards from the GeForce GTX 900 series or later which is great news for ….well most gamers if the Steam Hardware survey is anything to go by given that GPUs from Nvidias GTX series such as the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti still dominate much of the market.

These older GPUs won’t run Reflex as well as Ampere cards like the RTX 3080 but it’s still a free performance boost for those with the skills to take advantage of reduced latency. Will this make you a better gamer? With time to adjust it certainly provides you with an advantage though to make a real difference this will need to be paired with well-optimized peripherals like gaming keyboards as well as a Reflex-supported lightweight gaming mouse and a similarly enabled high-refresh-rate monitor equipped with Nvidia Gsync.

You can think of this as a recipe. Reflex is a fantastic ingredient when used by the right hands but it's unlikely to make much of a difference alone or by those who aren't especially skilled chefs…uh I mean gamers. If you can pair it with additional equipment though you’ll see a noticeable difference which should give you the edge over any opponent who doesn’t have the same hardware or features enabled.

That does sadly mean you’ll still need plenty of practice to ‘git gud’ but for something with no downsides you should have this feature enabled especially if you already have compatible hardware or feel your performance is being impacted by high latency. You literally have nothing to lose except for a game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei90aGlzLWlzLWhvdy1tdWNoLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLXNob3VsZC1jb3N0LWJhc2VkLW9uLXRoZWlyLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWFsb25l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This is how much graphics cards should cost based on their performance alone,"AMD and NVIDIA it’s time for price cuts

With GPU prices declining quickly 3DCenter came up with an idea to compare official suggested retail prices to the graphics card’s actual performance.

This is an insight of how much should each card cost based on its performance alone. The price to performance value is calculated by 3DCenter’s 4K index meticulously collected data based on a long list of reviews.

As graphics cards become cheaper and available through multiple channels one can now choose between a number of different custom models or even consider its competition from other brands. This is especially true for high-end models which were among the first cards to see a significant drop in price over the last few weeks.

It is also no secret that many cards released mainly in 2021 were overpriced from the beginning. Both AMD and NVIDIA chose heavily inflated MSRPs because those cards would never sell at a lower price anyway. However it is about time both companies realize that their prices are no longer good in relation to the actual performance.

According to 3DCenter’s calculations who have chosen RTX 3070 as the reference point most of NVIDIA’s high-end models are overpriced and should cost a lot less. However mid-range and low-end models from the NVIDIA lineup could be considered well priced especially the RTX 3060 Ti model which offers better performance than its costs. That’s also the reason why many board partners had no 3060 Ti in stock for many months it was simply too powerful for its price and board partners could easily sell costlier SKUs in its place.

In fact the situation on the GPU market has changed so much that NVIDIA is supposedly no longer shipping its RTX 3080 12GB model to board partners. The reason stated by leaker MEGAsizeGPU is its price in comparison to RTX 3080 Ti. NVIDIA has never publicly confirmed 3080 12GB MSRP though.

nope，only 3080 12G is been stop produced. After the dramatic price drop of 3080Ti 3080 12G now has the same price as 3080Ti and that’s why Nvidia decides to stop sending 3080 12G chips to the AIC. — MEGAsizeGPU (@Zed__Wang) June 26 2022

The RTX 3090 series are among the worst priced cards in whole comparison. Both cards retail above 1000 USD while their actual prices should be below that value. However anything under RTX 3080 Ti is actually within 10% of the ‘Fair Price’ index which in most cases means small overpricing or perfect (100%) balance between MSRP and card’s performance (but remember this in reference to RTX 3070).

For AMD Radeon RX 6000 series the RX 6800 and 6800 non-XT appear to be the best priced model considering their performance. The inflated MSRP prices for RDNA2 are not really that far from the ‘Fair Price’ index though especially the middle of the stack. This isn’t the case for enthusiast and low-end models. The RX 6950XT should cost 735USD based on this analysis while the RX 6400 should drop to the 107 USD level.

One should remember that performance is not always the only thing that should be considered. This is especially true for flagship cards which come with highly sophisticated board designs massive cooling solutions or other features. That surely adds a cost for board partners that cannot be calculated by framerate alone.

One thing is certain the GPU price cut should be expected now more than ever. Sadly neither AMD nor NVIDIA are officially preparing one however boards partners are eagerly awaiting such announcements soon. The time is ticking though as the large stock of RTX 30/RX6000 cards is no longer a surprise to anyone retailers will now only have 3 months to sell the majority of current-gen cards before gamers’ attention shifts to the next generation.

This AV1 video decoding works in conjunction with libvdpau 1.5+ and using a Ampere or newer GPU that has the necessary hardware capabilities.

Since FFmpeg 4.4 there has been AV1 decode on NVIDIA GPUs via the NVDEC ""NVIDIA Decode"" interface that is part of their Video Codec SDK. FFmpeg also supports Intel QSV-accelerated decode Windows DXVA2/D3D11VA AV1 decode and CPU-based decoding via the DAV1D project. AV1 encode is also supported with FFmpeg by way of Intel's SVT-AV1. Now with FFmpeg Git AV1 VDPAU decode is in place for those preferring VDPAU to the newer NVDEC.

With that being said though with prices finally starting to drop to somewhat reasonable levels consumer demand for GPUs has been growing. – Following a Twitter post by leak source ‘@Zed__Wang‘ however it is being said that despite the 3080 only seeing its 12GB revision just a few months ago Nvidia may have already wrapped up production on the graphics card. In other words one 30XX model may already be in terms of manufacturing dead!

nope，only 3080 12G is been stop produced. After the dramatic price drop of 3080Ti 3080 12G now has the same price as 3080Ti and that’s why Nvidia decides to stop sending 3080 12G chips to the AIC. — MEGAsizeGPU (@Zed__Wang) June 26 2022

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ends Production?!

Given how new this revision was (compared to other models in the series) the news that the 3080 may have already ceased production is at least on the surface quite shocking. It seems however that while production on all other 30XX models still continues there is a logic as to why Nvidia has specifically chosen to phase out this one particular variant out early.

And in a nutshell? It boils down to comparative cost. With the price of the 3080 Ti dropping quite sharply over the last few months (with demand for models such as the 3070 and 3070 Ti still remaining quite high) Nvidia has a bit of a problem in that the 3080 sits at a rather awkward price/performance point with AIB partner models.

For what a 3080 costs (again from AIB partners) the additional cost for the 3080 Ti isn’t that much more. It is in fact so relatively negligible (circa $50-$75 in many cases) that Nvidia appears willing to bet that the 3080 is the one GPU they can afford to drop the earliest!

What Do We Think?

Having been keeping one eye on Founders Edition stock drops over the last 2 months I have noted myself that while 3090 3080 Ti’s and 3070/3070 Ti’s have been arriving in fairly regular levels the 3080 has been notably missing. In fact the 3080 is about the only high-end Nvidia GPU that you currently can’t buy!

The 3060 Ti is of course out of stock too but that’s for two key reasons. Firstly it’s an amazingly strong performer and secondly it’s one of the cheaper current-gen models. – If anything the 3060 Ti will probably be the last 30XX model to end production!

Put simply although this news has certainly not been confirmed by Nvidia (yet) I’m actually willing to believe that the source here is right on the money! The 3080 appears to be almost certainly out of production with Team Green seemingly happy in the awkward period we always see leading up to next-generation models to let the tiers above and below effectively phase it out of the market.

Is the Nvidia 3080 dead though? Well although I can’t guarantee it based on this leak and everything else I’ve seen over the last few months… Yes I’m actually willing to believe that Nvidia has stopped production!

What do you think? – Let us know in the comments!"

Stephen Mallozzi a rising fourth year at UVA will race in the No. 43 Toyota Tundra for Reaume Brothers Racing in the O'Reilly Auto Parts 150 on Saturday July 9th at 1:30pm.

A native of Swedesboro New Jersey Mallozzi got his start in racing as a go-kart driver at the age of nine. In 2017 he was the runner-up in the sport's Senior Rotax National Championship Series and went on to race for Team USA at the Rotax Grand Finals in Portugal. In the summer of 2021 Mallozzi moved to Mooresville North Carolina to join Reaume Brothers Racing and was soon announced as one of the inaugural drivers in the team's driver development program beginning a key step in his lifelong pursuit of making a NASCAR start.

For Mallozzi starting a NASCAR race is not simply a dream come true but the realization of a life goal that has been at the forefront of his mind for nearly six years when he got the news that his father had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.

“For me I’ve been pushing so hard to make this happen for my dad Mallozzi said. ""He has his own impossible fight after being given just six months to live. And since that initial diagnosis he’s been going for almost six years. My old man has been my inspiration to keep going and try so hard to make this happen. He gave so much so I could race and now it’s my turn to make him proud”.

Earning the opportunity to race in a sport that is notoriously hard to break into took an incredible combination of perseverance and resolve from Mallozzi as well as some help from Josh Reaume the owner of Reaume Brothers Racing.

“Mallozz is something else - his story the reason why he’s racing put together with his big personality make him the kind of guy you just want to root for” Reaume said. “I think racing is like a family and being able to help one of our own get his shot and letting Stephen complete something that is so important to him is an awesome thing to be a part of.”

“Breaking into motorsports in general is impossible and I am so grateful for people in racing like Josh who continuously give drivers opportunities” said Mallozzi.

After finishing up his third year at UVA Mallozzi finally got the news he has been waiting to hear for years that he will be making his NASCAR debut at Mid-Ohio.

""I cannot express how excited I am"" Mallozzi said. ""This has been an opportunity I've been dreaming of for a long time and the fact I get to do it with my dad around to see it - I get emotional thinking about it.""

With his father there to see it Mallozzi will make his racing debut at the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series O'Reilly Auto Parts 150 at Mid-Ohio on Saturday July 9th at 1:30pm. The race will be televised on FS1.

Onion and some vegetables also followed the price- hike trend raising sufferings of consumers further.

Retail price of common non-branded rice witnessed a hike by Tk 2.0-4.0 a kg as coarse rice was sold at Tk 52-54 a kg medium Tk 60-64 a kg and finer varieties at Tk 68-80 a kg.

Price of a five-kg pack of Pran RFL's Najirshail rice increased to Tk 480 (Tk 96 a kg) which was maximum Tk 89 a kg a week back.

BRAC's Aarong branded Miniket price hit the highest of Tk 91 a kg (Tk 455 per five-kg pack) whose previous MRP was Tk 82 a kg according to Chaldal.com.

Chaldal.com one of the leading online shopping platforms also markets rice of its own brand.

Its premium Najirshail rice price witnessed the highest Tk 10.76 a kg hike in last two weeks and was selling at Tk 2019 per 25-kg pack according to its website.

ACI TK Bangladesh Edible Oil Limited (BEOL) and other consumer goods companies were selling their Miniket and Najirhsial at much higher rates than those of the mainstream markets - from Tk 82 to Tk 90 a kg according to groceries.

Contacted Pran-RFL marketing director Kamruzzaman Kamal said he could comment after verifying some information.

He told the FE their production cost of the Nazirshail variety was Tk 86 a kg. The retail margin dealer margin and marketing costs are added to it. They make a maximum of 8.0 per cent profit.

The FE was also trying to reach officials of Chaldal.com but could not get any comment despite repeated efforts.

Meanwhile brinjal price hit maximum Tk 100 a kg tomato Tk 160 a kg and chilli Tk 180 a kg on Friday which traders attributed to the ongoing flood in many vegetable hubs.

Onion prices started increasing as its local variety rose to Tk 45-55 a kg and imported ones to Tk 55-60 a kg marking Tk 5.0-10 a kg hike in a week.

Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) secretary Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan said the government has a loose control over the leading consumer goods companies which is the key reason behind the consumers' sufferings.

He said edible oil wheat flour and sugar markets have become an oligopoly of the companies since decades back and now rice market especially its finer segment has also been dominated by such companies.

He opined that price of non-aromatic rice at Tk 90-96 a kg could only be justified when paddy price shot up to Tk 2300-2500 a maund.

In the recent two rice cropping seasons - last Aman and ongoing Boro - the best quality non-aromatic paddy prices never crossed Tk 1800 a maund.

The government should strictly monitor the market. Apart from the traditional millers and traders new big market players should be brought under strict vigilance to prevent any future crisis in the rice market he added.

Voth normally a reliever went three innings in his second start. He gave up an RBI double to Jake Burger in the second for Chicago’s lone hit.

The only real drama occurred in the second inning after Kopech retired the first two batters. He nailed Mateo near the left shoulder and upper back with a similar pitch to the one that hit Chicago’s Josh Harrison on Thursday. Mateo had some words for Kopech. The benches and bullpens emptied but no punches were thrown. Both teams were issued warnings.

East Lincoln linebacker Ben Cutter following an official visit to campus.

Inside linebackers coach Jeff Koonz served as the lead recruiter for Cutter and the pair developed a close relationship over the past several months.

The Mountaineers offered Cutter a month ago but had been in contact prior to that. The linebacker was naturally excited to add West Virginia to his collection.

“This offer is one that I have been waiting on and really working towards for a while” he said.

Cutter is slotted to play one of the inside linebacker positions in the scheme and the coaching staff likes his nose for the ball and how he can wrap up and tackle.

The Rivals.com three-star prospect is coming off a dominant season where he recorded 158 tackles 15 tackles for loss and an interception on the defensive side of the ball. He also averaged 6.3 yards per carry while spending time as a running back last season.

West Virginia had been trending for Cutter for some time but after taking an official visit to campus he decided that the time was now to end his recruitment and pledge to the Mountaineers.

Cutter becomes the 13th commitment for West Virginia in the 2023 recruiting class and is the second at the linebacker spot along with Philadelphia (Pa.) St. Joseph's 2023 linebacker Josiah Trotter.

The ceremony which was originally set to take place on July 22nd has been delayed indefinitely in a likely bid to push the US government towards passing the CHIPS Act.

“There is no reason that we should not pass this bill through Congress in July”

Intel told US lawmakers and government officials that it’s delaying its ceremony “due in part to uncertainty around” the CHIPS Act according to an email viewed by the WSJ. In a statement to The Verge Intel spokesperson William Moss reiterates that the “scope and pace” of the company’s project rely on funding from the CHIPS Act. “Unfortunately CHIPS Act funding has moved more slowly than we expected and we still don’t know when it will get done” Moss adds.

Moss goes on to say “it is time for Congress to act” so the company can “move forward at the speed and scale” for its projects in and outside of Ohio. Although Intel has delayed its groundbreaking ceremony Moss says it hasn’t pushed back plans to begin building its facilities. Construction is still set to commence in late 2022 with production starting in 2025.

“We expressed our belief that there is no reason that we should not pass this bill through Congress in July” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement following a meeting about the chip-related legislation on Tuesday.

Congress faces mounting pressure from Intel and other government officials to pass a final version of the CHIPS Act before the Congressional recess in August. As noted by The Post officials are concerned that Congress’ slow action on the bill could cause semiconductor companies to turn their attention away from the US.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9nYWRnZXRzLW5ld3MvZXhwbGFpbmVkLXdoYXQtaXMtdGhlLXVzLWNoaXBzLWFjdC1vdmVyLXdoaWNoLWludGVsLWhhcy1kZWxheWVkLXBsYW5zLXRvLWJ1aWxkLTIwLWJpbGxpb24tZmFjdG9yeS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MjQ0NzQ0Ni5jbXPSAa8BaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vZ2FkZ2V0cy1uZXdzL2V4cGxhaW5lZC13aGF0LWlzLXRoZS11cy1jaGlwcy1hY3Qtb3Zlci13aGljaC1pbnRlbC1oYXMtZGVsYXllZC1wbGFucy10by1idWlsZC0yMC1iaWxsaW9uLWZhY3RvcnkvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkyNDQ3NDQ2LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explained: What is the US Chips Act over which Intel has 'delayed' plans to build $20 billion factory,"What is Chips for America Act

What is the aim of the

US Chips Act

Where is the bill stalled

Intel has reportedly delayed plans to build its $20 billion semiconductor factory in the US over the Chips Act. The chip-maker said that it's not going ahead with the groundbreaking of Ohio facility as of now due to the ongoing delay of the Chips Act. ""Unfortunately Chips Act funding has moved more slowly than we expected and we still don't know when it will get done"" Intel said in a statement.The chip giant however clarified that it still plans to begin construction on the project this year and manufacturing should start by 2025.Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (Chips) Act is a $52 billion funding package for US' domestic chip manufacturing. The US Senate passed a version of the bill in 2021 but it has yet to get approval from the US President Joe Biden . This is the summary of the bill as per US Congress website:* The bill establishes investments and incentives to support US semiconductor manufacturing research and development and supply chain security.* Specifically the bill provides an income tax credit for semiconductor equipment or manufacturing facility investment through 2026.* The bill also establishes a trust fund to be allocated upon reaching an agreement with foreign government partners to promote (1) Consistency in policies related to microelectronics; (2) Transparency in microelectronic supply chains; and (3) Alignment in policies towards non-market economies.* The US Department of Commerce shall through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) carry out a programme of research and development investment to accelerate the design development and manufacturability of next generation microelectronics including through the creation of a Manufacturing USA institute for semiconductor manufacturing. Commerce shall also establish a program to match state and local government incentives offered to private entities for the purposes of building fabrication facilities relating to semiconductor manufacturing. Further Commerce shall assess the capabilities of the US industrial base to support the national defense in light of the global nature of supply chains and interdependencies between the industrial bases of the US and foreign countries with respect to the manufacture and design of semiconductors.* The Department of Defense shall prioritise the use of specified available amounts for programmes projects and activities in connection with semiconductor and related technologies.* The President shall establish within NIST a subcommittee on matters relating to US leadership in semiconductor technology and innovation which shall develop a national strategy on semiconductor research.The share of modern semiconductor manufacturing capacity located in the US is said to have come down from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2021. This is said to be largely because of big investments and incentives from other countries in chip manufacturing something that the US government has not. By enacting the CHIPS for America Act in the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Congress are said to have acknowledged the critical role the that the US semiconductor industry plays in the country's future.The funding still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives. The House and Senate reportedly need to come together to pass a bill that is agreeable to both. Presently the bill is stalled as there is a gap between the House and Senate. The two chambers need to resolve some key differences in their bills. ""The House legislation includes trade proposals that are not in the Senate bill while the Senate bill authorizes an additional $200 billion to accelerate competition with China. That is not in the House version"" as per a report in the Newstack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Jpei9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDIyLzA2LzI1LzIwMDM3ODA0OTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TSMC Japan 3DIC R&D center completes clean room,"TSMC Japan 3DIC R&D center completes clean room

AHEAD OF THE PACK: The TSMC subsidiary was set up to research next generations of 3D silicon stacking and advanced packaging technology in materials science

By Lisa Wang / Staff reporter





Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC 台積電) yesterday said its subsidiary TSMC Japan 3DIC R&D Center has completed construction of its clean room in the Tsukuba Center of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.

The center was established in Japan’s Ibaraki Prefecture in March last year to pursue research into the next generations of 3D silicon stacking and advanced packaging technologies in materials science the chipmaker said in a statement.

The Japanese government is to provide an unspecified subsidy for the center.

The new technologies would enable system-level innovations to enhance computing performance and integrate more functionality opening a new path for driving semiconductor technology forward in addition to the industry’s conventional path of shrinking transistor size TSMC said.

With the completion of the clean room the TSMC Japan 3DIC R&D Center is to support research and development of state-of-the-art 3D IC packaging material in collaboration with its Japanese partners domestic research institutes and universities possessing strengths in semiconductor materials and equipment the statement said.

“Beginning with our foundry business model TSMC has always believed that by focusing on what we do best each of us in the semiconductor field can maximize our contribution to pushing technology forward” TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei (魏哲家) said in the statement.

“The Japan 3DIC R&D Center is a perfect example of this collaboration in action. By bringing TSMC together with Japanese talent we will empower each other to make breakthroughs together” he said.

“We are witnessing an increase in structural demand driven by the megatrends of 5G and high-performance computing-related applications and further technology innovation will be needed to meet this demand” TSMC Japan 3DIC R&D Center vice president and general manager Yutaka Emoto said in the statement.

“Japan has many companies with functional materials and key technologies that are important in the global semiconductor supply chain and TSMC will continue to work on semiconductor process innovation through joint research and development with them” he said.

“At the same time we can serve as a bridge between our partners at the 3DIC R&D Center and the world-class semiconductor companies among TSMC’s customers” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvSnVuLzI1L2ltZWMtdG8taGVscC1zZXQtdXAtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci11bml0cy1pbi1pbmRpYS0yNDY5NDc1Lmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi9KdW4vMjUvaW1lYy10by1oZWxwLXNldC11cC1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXVuaXRzLWluLWluZGlhLTI0Njk0NzUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IMEC to help set up semiconductor units in India,According to officials from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) IMEC which is known as an intermediate research organisation in the world of semiconductor fabs will also develop talent and research abilities in the country. “I am happy to announce that Belgium’s IMEC agreed to provide us with technical support to set the semiconductor ecosystem” said the official.

Chevron which is headquartered in San Ramon confirmed that it will stay within the city in it’s new space saying that the real estate market right now is allowing them to adjust employees who work at the headquarters. Unlike previous big company shifts in California such as Tesla and Oracle the company will not be moving it’s headquarters out of state.

“The current real estate market provides the opportunity to right-size our office space to meet the requirements of our headquarters-based employee population” said the company in a statement.

However while the companies headquarters will not be loving out of state a significant numbers of employees will with many employees expected to make the move to the Texas Chevron offices in Houston sometime next year. While the exact number is unknown Chevron will be paying moving costs for employees wanting to move. With Houston offering cheaper housing and lower taxes many are expected to take the move away from the Bay Area.

With Houston being a hub for energy companies Chevron would follow in the footsteps of ExxonMobil who moved their headquarters from Dallas to Houston earlier this year by establishing a larger presence in the city. Chevron itself will be expanding inside the former Enron headquarters building in Houston.

“Like Tech companies going to Austin from the Bay Area energy companies from all over are going to Houston” explained San Francisco-based tech lawyer David Singth to the Globe on Friday. “This won’t be a full move and is likely more in response to more people wanting to work from home more than anything else but it does indeed add to the worrying trend of Californian businesses leaving the state. Leaders here don’t seem to realize just how devastating all these losses can be. It’s tax money from several sources being cut off not to mention prestige job opportunities bringing in the best and brightest to the state and more.

“A lot of people still try and come to California for a decent job a decent living and having a nice starter house but in California and especially the Bay Area that is not the reality at this time. People have been bucking away from working here and this Chevron move is just the latest indication that something is wrong in California.

“The state needs to be more business friendly needs to reduce taxes and bring back affordable homes for people to really reverse this trend but nothing is really happening there. So tech companies continue to leave. Texas and working from home stole San Francisco’s “You have gotta be here to make it big” mentality and now we see it seeping into other industries like energy. And you can bet Chevron won’t be the last one.”

Chevron is expected to finalize the moves sometime next year.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'You are the foundation that keeps our family together.'

""Only by working together with key law enforcement and prosecutorial partners in the EU can we effectively combat the threat that ransomware poses to our society"" said US assistant attorney general Kenneth Polite Jr in a canned statement.

Earlier this month at the annual RSA Conference this same topic was on cybersecurity professionals' minds – and lips.

Ransomware and other cybercrimes in which miscreants extort organizations for money ""is still the vast majority of the threat activity that we see"" Cyber Threat Alliance CEO Michael Daniel said in an interview at the security event.

Increasingly however cybercrime rings still tracked as ransomware operators are turning toward primarily data theft and extortion – and skipping the encryption step altogether. Rather than scramble files and demand payment for the decryption keys and all the faff in between in facilitating that simply exfiltrating the data and demanding a fee to not leak it all is just as effective. This shift has been ongoing for many months and is now virtually unavoidable.

The FBI and CISA this month warned about a lesser-known extortion gang called Karakurt which demands ransoms as high as $13 million. Karakurt doesn't target any specific sectors or industries and the gang's victims haven't had any of their documents encrypted and held to ransom.

Instead the crooks claim to have stolen data with screenshots or copies of exfiltrated files as proof and they threaten to sell it or leak it publicly if they don't receive a payment.

'Multi-faceted extortion'

""That's exactly what's happening to a lot of the victims that we work with"" Mandiant Intelligence VP Sandra Joyce told The Register. ""We call it multi-faceted extortion. It's a fancy way of saying data theft paired with extortion.""

Some of these thieves offer discounted ransoms to corporations to encourage them to pay sooner with the demanded payment getting larger the longer it takes to cough up the cash (or Bitcoin as the case may be).

Until it is not the lucrative business that it is today it's not going away

Additionally some crime groups offer ""sliding-scale payment systems"" Joyce noted. ""So you pay for what you get"" and depending on the amount of ransom paid ""you get a control panel you get customer support you get all of the tools you need.""

As criminals move deeper into extortion they rely on other tactics to force organizations to pay up – such as leaking stolen confidential data from Tor-hidden websites and devising other ways to publicly humiliate companies into paying a ransom for their swiped documents Joyce added. ""Until it is not the lucrative business that it is today it's not going away.""

This echoes what Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 incident responders are seeing as well. Crooks post on average details about sensitive information stolen from seven new victims per day on these dark-web leak sites according to Unit 42 research released at RSA Conference.

""The cyber-extortion crisis continues because cybercriminals have been relentless in their introduction of increasingly sophisticated attack tools extortion techniques and marketing campaigns that have fueled this unprecedented global digital crime spree"" wrote Ryan Olson the VP of threat intelligence for Palo Alto Networks who leads Unit 42.

More sophisticated … marketing campaigns?

Indeed much has been made about the growing ransomware-as-a-service market whereby malware developers rent out their code to less tech-savvy fraudsters to deploy on victims' networks once access has been obtained by buying stolen or leaked login credentials or paying someone else to do the intrusion or similar.

Indeed the Conti internal communications leaked earlier in the year highlighted how these ransomware gangs operate akin to software-as-a-service startups.

And on top of that the way that these crime groups use marketing and public relations campaigns points to a whole new level of sophistication according to Ryan Kovar who leads the Splunk Surge research team.

In March Kovar's security biz published research on how long it takes ten of the big ransomware families – including Lockbit Conti and REvil – to encrypt 100000 files. They found Lockbit was the swiftest – indeed the reason the team undertook this analysis in the first place was because that ransomware gang claimed on its Tor website to have the ""fastest ransomware.""

""They're to the point where someone said 'We're losing ground to other ransomware families. And we actually have to create marketing material to better position our ransomware as the choice du jour'"" Kovar said in an interview on the sidelines of RSAC.

""That's fascinating"" he continued. ""The sophistication shows there's a competitive aspect to this beyond just 'we're good at converting ransoms to Bitcoin'.""

But still hitting the same unpatched vulns

Miscreants may have moved on to new extortion techniques and more sophisticated business models but they are exploiting the same known vulnerabilities – simply because these still work and don't require a heavy lift from the malware operators. These are profit-seeking criminals after all looking to keep costs low and profit margins high.

""The way the ransomware actors have success … is often through those known exploitable vulnerabilities"" NSA Cybersecurity Director Rob Joyce said speaking during a panel at RSA Conference.

Enterprises can reduce their risk by patching these known actively exploited bugs he added. ""That needs to be the base"" Joyce said. ""Everybody needs to get to that base level and take care of the unlocked doors that [cybercriminals] are coming in today.""

In a separate interview at the show Aanchal Gupta who leads Microsoft's Security Response Center concurred.

""Businesses sometimes think they have to do something unique about ransomware"" she told The Register. ""And I would say no you do not have to do anything unique about ransomware. All you need to do is the same protect detect respond.""

Protect means patch your systems and detection requires visibility across the network Gupta added. ""Because they all come through the known vulnerabilities that have been disclosed and there are patches available 99 percent of the time.""

Typically these profit-driven crooks aren't breaching networks through zero-day exploits she said. ""They are not going to purchase a zero-day for a half a million dollars to do a ransomware attack"" Gupta noted.

Gupta and others encouraged organizations to run table-top exercises so they are prepared if or when an attack hits.

Tell the truth. Even if it hurts

The public response to an intrusion needs to be transparent if it's to be helpful – even if it's embarrassing. This includes having a ransomware press release written in advance noted Dmitri Alperovitch chair of security-centric think tank Silverado Policy Accelerator.

""Write a press release that you're going to put out in the event of a data leak or a ransomware attack"" he said. ""Have that ready because oftentimes inevitably it takes days for people to get their arms around what they're going to say publicly and they involve way too many lawyers. Get that out of the way early on so that you can just fill in the details.""

And don't lie. Eventually corporations do recover from ransomware attacks – especially if they have good backups.

But they may not regain customers' trust if they aren't transparent about what happened CrowdStrike CTO Mike Sentonas told The Register. His company was hired to assist in incident response after a ""well-known media company got hit with ransomware"" Sentonas said.

CrowdStrike advised the corporation to tell the truth ""and they went and did the opposite said it was a sophisticated adversary and no one could have ever stopped this"" Sentonas said. In fact ""it was a really basic attack"" he noted. ""And you come out looking a little bit silly through that process."" ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VuZG9uZmMuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvMTE1OTI3My9raXJieS1iZW50bGV5LXJldW5pdGVzLXdpdGgtbmF0YWxpZS13b29kLWFzLW91ci1hZmx3LXByb2dyYW0tdGFrZXMtc2hhcGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kirby Bentley reunites with Natalie Wood as our AFLW program takes shape,"WESTERN Bulldogs VFLW coach Kirby Bentley has reunited with former coaching colleague Natalie Wood at Essendon.

It’s the first movie of the year and only the second in COVID times (following Sony’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” with $1.9 billion) to reach that benchmark. It’s even more impressive that “Maverick” hit the $1 billion mark without playing in China or Russia two major markets.

After only 31 days on the big screen “Top Gun: Maverick” has become Tom Cruise‘s first movie to surpass $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Previously 2018’s “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” ranked as the actor’s most successful film with $791.1 million worldwide.

Cruise took to Twitter to celebrate the achievement writing “To all the films in release to all the studios and to all the exhibitors: congratulations. To the audience: thank you for venturing out and allowing us to entertain you. See you at the movies.”

To all the films in release to all the studios and to all the exhibitors: congratulations. To the audience: thank you for venturing out and allowing us to entertain you. See you at the movies. — Tom Cruise (@TomCruise) June 27 2022

Earlier on Monday Paramount Pictures president and chief executive officer Brian Robbins says the studio has been “absolutely blown away” by the response to “Top Gun: Maverick.”

Popular on Variety

“It’s rare to get the special kind of alchemy that creates a true event film and we have been absolutely blown away by the global response to ‘Top Gun: Maverick'” Robbins said in a statement. “Thank you to the incomparable Tom Cruise our visionary filmmakers and talented cast and our amazing marketing and distribution teams for delivering an absolutely perfect movie and theatrical experience for audiences around the world.”

Prior to this weekend the sequel to the 1986 action flick “Top Gun” was already the highest-grossing movie of the year at the domestic box office with $521 million. Now in its fifth weekend of release “Maverick” added $30.5 million and stands in a close race with newcomer “Elvis” for the No. 1 spot on domestic box office charts.

With another $484.7 million at the international box office revenues for “Maverick” currently stand at a staggering $1.006 billion worldwide. Those ticket sales were enough to overtake Disney’s Marvel adventure “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” ($943 million) as the highest-grossing movie of the year at the global box office.

Though “Maverick” became an old-fashioned word-of-mouth hit the box office success of the long-delayed film was far from preordained. But thanks to critical and commercial praise “Top Gun: Maverick” has been crushing box office records since opening in theaters over Memorial Day weekend. During the extended holiday the film earned $160.5 million marking the first movie in Cruise’s 40-year career to surpass $100 million in a single weekend.

According to Paramount repeat customers and Imax screens have been fueling momentum in the weeks since its theatrical debut. By its fourth weekend in North American movie theaters 16% of the audience had returned more than once and 4% had returned three times or more.

Directed by Joseph Kosinski the $170 million-budgeted “Top Gun: Maverick” centers on Cruise’s Pete “Maverick” Mitchell as he trains a new group of cocky aviators for a crucial assignment. The cast includes Miles Teller Glen Powell Jon Hamm Jennifer Connelly and Val Kilmer who played Iceman in the first “Top Gun.”

“This milestone is a testament to five years of collaboration with our incredible cast and crew including the men and women of the US Navy” Kosinski said. “The enthusiasm from fans around the world has shown us there is no replacement for watching a movie in a packed theater. When I was 12 I sat in awe watching ‘Top Gun’ a film that defined the theatrical experience for me. To be part of something that is shaping moviegoing for a new generation of fans is the greatest achievement of all.”

For Paramount the movie extends a stellar 2022 box office streak. After barely releasing any films during the pandemic the studio has struck gold at the box office with “Sonic the Hedgehog 2” ($190 million in North America) “The Lost City” ($105 million in North America) “Scream” ($81 million in North America) and “Jackass Forever” ($57 million in North America). Notably there’s not a Spandex superhero in the bunch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iYW5raW5nLWJvZHktYmlzLXVyZ2VzLWRlY2lzaXZlLTA5MDM0MzUxNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banking body BIS urges decisive wave of global rate hikes to stem inflation,"By Marc Jones

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's central bank umbrella body the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has called for interest rates to be raised ""quickly and decisively"" to prevent the surge in inflation turning into something even more problematic.

The Swiss-based BIS has held its annual meeting in recent days where top central bankers met to discuss their current difficulties and one of the most turbulent starts to a year ever for global financial markets.

Surging energy and food prices mean inflation in many places is now its hottest in decades. But the usual remedy of ramping up interest rates is raising the spectre of recession and even of the dreaded 1970s-style ""stagflation"" where rising prices are coupled with low or negative economic growth.

""The key for central banks is to act quickly and decisively before inflation becomes entrenched"" Agustín Carstens BIS general manager said as part of the body's post-meeting annual report Annual Economic Report published on Sunday.

Carstens former head of Mexico's central bank said the emphasis was to act in ""quarters to come"". The BIS thinks an economic soft landing - where rates rise without triggering recessions - is still possible but accepts it is a difficult situation.

""A lot of it will depend on precisely on how permanent these (inflationary) shocks are"" Carstens said adding that the response of financial markets would also be crucial.

""If this tightening generates massive losses generates massive asset corrections and that contaminates consumption investment and employment - of course that is a more difficult scenario.""

World markets are already suffering one of the biggest sell-offs in recent memory as heavyweight central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve - and from next month the ECB - move away from record low rates and almost 15 years of back-to-back stimulus measures.

Global stocks are down 20% since January and some analysts calculate that U.S. Treasury bonds the benchmark of world borrowing markets could be having their biggest losing first half of a year since 1788.

CREDIBILITY

Carstens said the BIS's own recent warnings about frothy asset prices meant the current correction was ""not necessarily a complete surprise"". That there hadn't been ""major market disruptions"" so far was also reassuring he added.

Story continues

Part of the BIS report published already last week said that the recent implosions in the cryptocurrency markets were an indication that long-warned-about dangers of decentralised digital money were now materialising.

Those collapses aren't expected to cause a systemic crisis in the way that bad loans triggered the global financial crash. But Carstens stressed losses would be sizeable and that the opaque nature of the crypto universe fed uncertainty.

Graphic: Central bank digital currencies - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mopanryagva/Pasted%20image%201656161287732.png

Returning to the macro economic picture he added that the BIS didn't currently expect a period of widespread stagflation to take hold.

He also said that though many global central banks and the BIS itself had significantly underestimated how quick global inflation has spiralled over the last six to 12 months they weren't about to lose hard-earned credibility overnight.

""Yes you can argue a little bit here about an error of timing of certain actions and the responses of the central banks. But by and large I think that the central banks have responded forcefully in a very agile fashion"" Carstens said.

""My sense is that central banks will prevail at the end of the day and that would be good for their credibility.""

The Kang Daniel and SpongeBob SquarePants collaboration officially launched on June 24!

Daniel’s agency KONNECT Entertainment had previously announced on June 23 the SpongeBob collaboration with Paramount Global. This is the first time the SpongeBob brand had an IP collab with a K-pop artist and the first time Kang Daniel partnered with an animated character. The fun and positive worldview of the show is delivered in an exclusive 12-item collection.

Through an MTV Asia interview Kang Daniel expressed his gratitude: “As DANITY know really I am a huge fan. I like Patrick Star so much. I am so glad that I have this great opportunity to collaborate and become a successful fan.”

One of the SpongeBob memes Daniel posted on his Instagram seems fitting for the special occasion.





When asked why he loves SpongeBob longtime fan Daniel replied “First they are very cute! And all of the SpongeBob characters are simple and carefree. They all live a simple life. So I think it is really good to watch it without thinking all the time. I think that’s how I want to live my life.”

MTV asked which song from his first full album ‘The Story’ goes well with SpongeBob. Daniel recommended ‘How We Live’ for its playful content and lyrics. “The attitude towards life seems to be similar.”





Additionally Cafe De KONNECT is holding an event with character macarons and PINEHOUSE drinks. The cafe was also decorated in celebration.











Merchandise pre-orders are open until June 30 2022 through the KONNECT Shop and international options here. A variety of products are up for grabs including stationary and accessories.





Stay tuned for further updates on the collaboration.



In other news Kang Daniel is currently on hiatus from performing due to injury but recently dropped a Gatorade promotional single titled ‘Move Like This’ with figure skater Yuna Kim and IVE’s Yujin."

The event spanned the grounds of the Century Village Museum in Burton. Large rainbow balloon displays designed by balloon artist Extra Betty greeted visitors along with music yard games face painting and more. Exhibitors set up tables in the Lennah Bond Activity Center where visitors could learn more about their organizations and missions.

Ginger Marshall administrative coordinator for the MetroHealth Pride Network was there to inform attendees about the network’s doctors and to learn more about the other exhibitors and organizations in attendance.

Marshall described the network’s mission as “healthcare for LGBTQ+ people that is caring and competent and knowledgeable and life-spanning from cradle to grave; for kids of LGBTQ parents.” The network’s website mentioned that its doctors address general health needs as well as those specific to LGBTQ+ patients.

Dick and Jan Hurwitz came to represent East Shore Unitarian Universalist Church from Kirtland.

“We’re here because we believe in diversity of all kinds” said Dick Hurwitz. “We don’t have one set of beliefs that everybody has to ascribe to. We help each person in the church find their own spiritual path.”

Chris Steigerwald president of the board for the Geauga SOGI Support Network said other attendees included advocacy groups such as Equality Ohio and TransOhio; Camp Lilac; LGBTQ+ health representatives from University Hospitals Cleveland Clinic and Signature Health; the Social Justice Advocacy Ministry from Federated Church in Chagrin Falls; Bainbridge United Church of Christ; Community Church of Chesterland; Lake Geauga Recovery Center; Kent State University Geauga Campus; PFLAG Cleveland; and League of Women Voters.

Steigerwald added that the event’s sponsors included Parker Hannifin Extra Betty Howling Print and Promo Huntington Bank and KeyBank.

The network with the SOGI in its name standing for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity was founded in January 2020 noted Steigerwald. She said that the organization’s mission is “to engage with individuals families friends and the Geauga community to embrace sexual orientation and gender identity through collaboration education and advocacy.

“We want the youth to feel more comfortable feel that they are accepted that they’re embraced and supported” she said.

Due to the pandemic Steigerwald said that the network did not hold major community events in its first two years. Organizers chose Century Village because it has a large property is “centrally located in the Geauga community” and is private so the organization could ask individuals to leave if it deemed necessary. An officer from the Burton Village Police Department stood watch at the entrance near the parking lot.

Steigerwald said that there were community members both in favor of and against Pride in Geauga. Speaking on June 22 of the previous night’s Burton Village Council meeting Steigerwald said “It was all very respectful last night but definitely there’s disagreement. But in the process of that we have people reaching out and thanking us for being there for speaking up for having this event.”

Steigerwald noted that the Geauga SOGI Support Network has support groups for LGBTQ+ middle and high school students as well as the parents of individuals who identify as transgender or nonbinary. The network also holds outreach programs with organizations such as churches schools social service agencies and more and is planning to begin work with organizations such as the Community Life Collaborative which Steigerwald described as an organization that offers “programming and education around social justice issues like immigration and the environment.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Giving money to a worthy cause makes people feel good. And if in exchange for that money they get a bag of tortilla chips covered with a dusting of nacho cheese so be it. Those people didn't ask to be heroes.

Actually according to the Doritos website it's unfair to call Doritos ""just a chip."" The snack company calls its cheesy chip ""fuel for disruption"" and says that ""with every crunch we aim to redefine culture and support those who are boldly themselves."" That's a lot of lofty ideas to put on a little chip's tiny shoulders but Doritos isn't chippy about it. ""Our flavors ignite adventure and inspire action"" the website explains. Which is perhaps the sentiment that was behind last year's SOLID BLACK campaign.

Now in its second year according to a PepsiCo press release the initiative seeks to fund and elevate Black people that are seen as ""changemakers"" in their communities and is setting its sights on non-profit organizations that create space for Black creators. The brand plans on using its products and presence on television and social media to shine a light on those creators. It will be ""investing more than $5 million as part of the SOLID BLACK campaign to amplify stories of Black joy strength and resilience.""

Sunita Tulsiani 65 told ThePrint “We had to switch to Pepsi in the absence of Thums Up. I remember how my then 14-year-old son used to crave Thums Up. But we didn’t know where to get it from.”

New Delhi: Sometime in the summer of 1994 lovers of Thums Up the popular cola brand in India were in for a rude surprise. Their favourite drink had inconspicuously disappeared from the stores near them.

Thums Up was launched in the Indian market in 1977 under Ramesh Chauhan’s Parle group. In 1993 the brand was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company.

For a long time it was believed that this was just a way for The Coca-Cola Company to ‘kill’ Thums Up and diminish any competition that Coke faced.

While Coca-Cola has repeatedly denied this allegation marketing gurus of the time believed that the company was indeed up to something suspicious. The successful removal of other carbonated drinks such as Goldspot and Citra (both initially owned by the Parle group) from the market had not helped the company’s case.

Lloyd Mathias business strategist and former executive vice president at PepsiCo India gave an explanation for this. “The feeling among people was that being an international company Coca-Cola’s focus would be more on its global brands like Fanta Sprite and of course Coke and other drinks in the Indian market will phase out gradually” he told ThePrint.

But Indians didn’t let go of their favourite Thums Up which continues to be the leader in the country even today with 42% market share. Such has been the romance with Thums Up that a hill in Maharashtra has been named after the drink.

‘Attempted murder’ of Thums Up

The Coca-Cola Company had left India in 1977 when the then Indian government asked it to not just transfer 60 per cent of the shares of its Indian firm — according to what was then the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act — but also reveal the formula for its secret recipe to Indian shareholders. The company only returned to India post liberalisation in 1993.

At this point in time Thums Up was the leading product in Indian markets. Chauhan of Parle group was the mastermind behind Thums Up’s formulation and he had very strategically placed the drink in markets to fill the void left by Coke and other colas exiting India.

One of the strongest points of this homegrown drink was also its tagline ‘Taste the Thunder’ and its appeal of being an Indian cola brand.

“Taste the Thunder is India’s longest running national campaign even today” said Ashok Kurien whose agency Ambience Advertising had come up with the text.

When Coca-Cola re-entered the Indian market one of the ways in which it tried to displace Thums Up with Coke was by ‘poaching the franchise bottlers’ of Parle that owned Thums Up. Parle had been working on an agreement basis with bottle manufacturers across the country.

When Coca-Cola went around buying those units Parle did not have bottles to actually pack its drink in and sell. Chauhan finally sold off the beverage arm of Parle to Coca-Cola for $40 million.

After Coca-Cola acquired Thums Up the drink nearly stopped being available in the market. It was also not being advertised or marketed anywhere. But Coca-Cola’s strategy backfired since people started buying Pepsi instead of Coke. The company realised that by ‘killing’ Thums Up it had served the market share to Pepsi.

“Let rumour be rumour. No truth that we tried to kill Thums Up or any other drink” Deepak Jolly a Coca-Cola communication executive told ThePrint.

Coca-Cola had about 60.5 per cent share of the Indian soft-drink market in the 1990s but soon understood that if it removed Thums Up it would be left with merely 28.7 per cent of the market share. Hence Thums Up was re-launched in 1997.

“Initially Coca-Cola’s focus was on their mainstream brands but soon after a few years they realised that there was a lot of equity with Thums Up Limca and other Indian brands. And they decided to stabilise the production of these to go after their major competition Pepsi” Matthias added.

The other Indian beverages acquired by Coca-Cola however did not survive the onslaught. Citra and Goldspot were relinquished from the market by the 2000s as they were competing with the likes of Fanta and Sprite the global brands owned and prioritised by Coca-Cola. However Limca was retained after Coca-Cola realised that the demand for it was high in the early 2000s. In 2012 Coca-Cola had also brought back Citra for rural areas.

Appeal of Thums Up

One of the reasons why Thums Up was an instant hit is because it gave more quantity for less price.

Vijay Sharma director at Employees’ State Insurance Corporation recalled “Thums Up was the first drink to launch large-size bottles (300 ml as against 250 ml prevalent at that time) called ‘maha cola’ which added to its appeal as a thirst quenching summer beverage. I also remember cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and Imran Khan advertising together for Thums Up in sports magazines two sportsmen of different nations promoting the same product a rare scene in today’s time.”

Drinking Thums Up was also seen as an assertion of masculinity strength and the fact that anyone drinking it was a grown-up and to be taken seriously. Advertisements for Thums Up featured actors like Akshay Kumar Salman Khan and Mahesh Babu as its brand ambassadors. They were shown to prefer the beverage over any other for its “new code of masculinity”.

One of other reasons why Thums Up sustained in the Indian market was also the rise in demand for homegrown products post-liberalisation.

Anupam Roongta a Jaipur-based investor and trainer said “I believe lots of factors were at play together in making Thums Up what it is — ambassadors easy availability and most importantly taste. Once people get used to a certain taste it’s not easy to overpower that with any other product. Maggi is another such example. No matter how many other products came be it healthy or of any other taste since the customers are used to the taste of Maggi it is just unstoppable.”

PFE,Pfizer,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzI1L3BmaXplci1zYXlzLWl0cy1vbWljcm9uLWNvbnRhaW5pbmctYm9vc3RlcnMtb3V0cGVyZm9ybS1jdXJyZW50LXZhY2NpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer says its Omicron-containing boosters outperform current vaccine,"New data from Pfizer indicate that a modified form of its Covid-19 vaccine may provide better protection against the Omicron variant.

Pfizer said Saturday that using new versions of its Covid-19 vaccine as boosters led to a superior antibody response against the Omicron variant compared to its current shot.

The results in some ways mirror those released by Moderna earlier this month. Data from both companies will be evaluated on Tuesday by a panel of experts convened by the Food and Drug Administration in the hopes of deciding what strains of the SARS-Cov-2 virus should be included in booster shots for the fall. Companies will need lead time to manufacture doses of new vaccines if it is decided they are needed.

In briefing documents posted by the FDA ahead of the meeting FDA researchers say that either of Pfizer’s Omicron-containing booster “improves the neutralizing antibody response to Omicron BA.1 compared to the prototype vaccine and does not negatively

affect the neutralizing antibody response against the ancestral strain of virus against which the prototype vaccine was designed.” The documents also say there are “caveats to be noted relevant to the interpretation of these data” that will be discussed at Tuesday’s meeting.

At the FDA meeting experts will vote on whether boosters should include an Omicron strain and discuss exactly what viral lineages should be included and what the makeup of the vaccines should be according to discussions questions the FDA posted for the meeting. The committee will also consider how a booster developed against the original strain by Novavax works as a booster.

The Pfizer data introduce a new question for the FDA panel to consider however. Moderna released data from only a bivalent vaccine meaning that the vaccine contains antigens for both the Omicron variant and the original strain that was prevalent earlier in the pandemic. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech provided data for both the bivalent vaccine and a monovalent one which contained only antigen for the Omicron variant.

Pfizer and BioNTech provided figures for the efficacy of the vaccine that appeared to show the monovalent vaccine might boost antibody titers more.

By one measure known as the geometric mean ratio (GMR) the monovalent 30 microgram booster compared to the current booster was 2.23; the 60 microgram monovalent booster had a GMR of 3.15 (higher is better). For the bivalent 30 and 60 microgram doses the GMR values were 1.56 and 1.97. Moderna had previously said that the GMR for its bivalent booster was 1.75.

Expressed another way Pfizer said that one month after administration the Omicron-modified monovalent booster increased neutralizing geometric mean titers a measure of antibodies that neutralize the virus by 13.5-fold for the lower dose and 19.6-fold for the higher one. The bivalent candidates increased titers by 9.1-fold for the lower dose and 10.9-fold for the higher one. Moderna previously said that its bivalent booster increased antibody titers by 8-fold above baseline levels.

It’s not clear how or if those differences would translate into better clinical results from the vaccines.

There could be benefits of a bivalent vaccine that are not shown by these antibody figures which capture only some of the immune response from a vaccine. It’s possible for instance that giving more types of antigen will help the vaccine be hardier against other variants. These will be the type of issues the FDA advisors will likely discuss on Tuesday.

In a prepared statement Ugur Sahin the CEO and co-founder of BioNTech suggested that adapting these vaccines to new variants could become the new normal noting that new Omicron sublineages are outcompeting the original Omicron strain.

“We will therefore remain vigilant and are prepared to rapidly adapt our Omicron-based vaccine to emerging sublineages if epidemiological and laboratory data suggest” Sahin said.

Editor’s note: This article was updated to include documents the FDA posted for the meeting on Tuesday June 28.

PAXLOVID is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions (eg toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN] or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to its active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or any other components of the product.

PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions:

Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist: alfuzosin

Analgesics: pethidine propoxyphene

Antianginal: ranolazine

Antiarrhythmic: amiodarone dronedarone flecainide propafenone quinidine

Anti-gout: colchicine

Antipsychotics: lurasidone pimozide clozapine

Ergot derivatives: dihydroergotamine ergotamine methylergonovine

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin simvastatin

PDE5 inhibitor: sildenafil (Revatio ®) when used for pulmonary arterial hypertension

Sedative/hypnotics: triazolam oral midazolam

PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. PAXLOVID cannot be started immediately after discontinuation of any of the following medications due to the delayed offset of the recently discontinued CYP3A inducer:

Anticancer drugs: apalutamide

Anticonvulsant: carbamazepine phenobarbital phenytoin

Antimycobacterials: rifampin

Herbal Products: St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum)

There are limited clinical data available for PAXLOVID. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with PAXLOVID use.

Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions: Initiation of PAXLOVID a CYP3A inhibitor in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID respectively. These interactions may lead to:

Clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe life-threatening or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications

Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of PAXLOVID

Loss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistance

Consult Table 1 of the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers for clinically significant drug interactions including contraindicated drugs. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PAXLOVID therapy; review concomitant medications during PAXLOVID therapy and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications.

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with PAXLOVID including urticaria angioedema dyspnea mild skin eruptions and pruritus. Cases of anaphylaxis TEN and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have also been reported with components of PAXLOVID (refer to NORVIR labeling). If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic transaminase elevations clinical hepatitis and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases liver enzyme abnormalities or hepatitis.

Because nirmatrelvir is co-administered with ritonavir there may be a risk of HIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection.

Adverse events in the PAXLOVID group (≥1%) that occurred at a greater frequency (≥5 subject difference) than in the placebo group were dysgeusia (6% and <1% respectively) diarrhea (3% and 2%) hypertension (1% and <1%) and myalgia (1% and <1%). The proportions of subjects who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event were 2% in the PAXLOVID group and 4% in the placebo group.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-authorization use of PAXLOVID. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions

Required Reporting for Serious Adverse Events and Medication Errors: The prescribing healthcare provider and/or the provider’s designee is/are responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events and medication errors potentially related to PAXLOVID within 7 calendar days from the healthcare provider’s awareness of the event.

Submit adverse event and medication error reports to FDA MedWatch using one of the following methods:

Online : https://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm

: https://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm Complete and submit a postage-paid FDA Form 3500 and returning by mail/fax

FDA Form 3500 Call 1-800-FDA-1088 to request a reporting form

In addition please provide a copy of all FDA MedWatch forms to: www.pfizersafetyreporting.com or by fax (1-866-635-8337) or phone (1-800-438-1985).

PAXLOVID is an inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring.

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates; therefore drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce PAXLOVID therapeutic effect.

Pregnancy: There are no available human data on the use of nirmatrelvir during pregnancy to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published observational studies on ritonavir use in pregnant women have not identified an increase in the risk of major birth defects. Published studies with ritonavir are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of miscarriage. There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy.

Lactation: There are no available data on the presence of nirmatrelvir in human or animal milk the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. A transient decrease in body weight was observed in the nursing offspring of rats administered nirmatrelvir. Limited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

Contraception: Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception.

Pediatrics: PAXLOVID is not authorized for use in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg. The safety and effectiveness of PAXLOVID have not been established in pediatric patients. The authorized adult dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg as observed in adults and adults with similar body weight were included in the trial EPIC-HR.

Systemic exposure of nirmatrelvir increases in renally impaired patients with increase in the severity of renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to <60 mL/min) reduce the dose of PAXLOVID to 150 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir twice daily for 5 days. Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions.

2. Pfizer says Omicron vaccines produce stronger immune response

A pair of Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine boosters designed to target the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus have been shown to produce a significantly stronger immune response to Omicron the companies said Saturday. The vaccines were designed to target the original BA.1 subvariant of Omicron but preliminary results suggest that they could also be effective against the increasingly dominant BA.4 and BA.5 strains. ""Based on these data we believe we have two very strong Omicron-modified candidates that elicit a substantially higher immune response against Omicron than we've seen to date"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. The results of the study have not yet been peer reviewed or published.

Ukrainian military intelligence accused Russian of attempting to ""drag Belarus into the war"" after Russian military aircraft fired missiles into Ukraine from Belarussian airspace on Saturday. These attacks which were carried out by Tu-22M3 jet bombers reportedly mark the first time since the war began that Russian warplanes have fired missiles from within the borders of Belarus.

9. Taliban begs U.S. to unfreeze currency reserves amid earthquake devastation

Afghanistan's Taliban government pleaded with the United States on Saturday to allow them access to the $7 billion in foreign currency reserves that were frozen after the U.S.-backed government collapsed last summer. This request came as the Taliban regime struggles to respond to a 6.1 magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Wednesday killing over 1000 people.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

INDIANAPOLIS — A man committed to reducing violent crime in Indianapolis by serving as one of the city's ""peacemakers"" was killed in a shooting at a near northeast side gas station on Saturday night.

According to police records John ""JB"" Barnett was shot just after 10 p.m. at the Phillips 66 gas station located at the corner of 34th Street and Keystone Avenue.

Officers arrived and found Barnett with injuries consistent with ""trauma"" IMPD said. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition and died shortly after arriving. The Marion County Coroner's Office ruled his death a homicide.

Barnett who was 45 years old was among dozens of peacemakers community outreach workers hired to play a critical role in reducing violence in neighborhoods.

The Office of Public Health and Safety (OPHS) mourned Barnett's loss in a series of tweets Sunday night.

Last night we lost a team member. There are no words to describe the pain we are feeling. But here are a few to remember the life of a father a son a partner and a brother: — Indianapolis OPHS (@IndyOPHS) June 26 2022

OPHS described Barnett as a ""comedian"" who could make anyone laugh and most importantly was overflowing with joy.

""One of the most important things to remember about him was his joy - the joy he brought to his children his friends his work and his family"" OPHS said.

He dedicated his life to serving his community. He spent Friday night the day before he died ""in typical JB fashion"" by working with kids at Riverside Park. OPHS said efforts like this exemplified who he was and how much he cared.

Maybe most strongly this legacy will live on in his children who were everything to him. Friends and family will make sure they remember how special their dad was. — Indianapolis OPHS (@IndyOPHS) June 26 2022

OPHS wrapped up the thread by offering condolences to Barnett's family and vowing to always remember him.

Today we are thinking of JB’s children mother and family as they navigate this incredibly challenging time. But we also will remember the laughter. The person he was. And the caring soul that he had. We remember JB. — Indianapolis OPHS (@IndyOPHS) June 26 2022

""In the work that we're doing every single day brings challenges"" said Dane Nutty with Indy Public Safety Foundation. ""We had no idea what scene he had just come from what event or dialogue with a fellow but he always took the opportunity to smile and say hello and I'll definitely remember that.""

""JB is known for being a comedian."" said Rodriguez. ""He's known for smiling at people even when he didn't know them and I think our community...we get so bogged down in all the horrible things that are going on that we forget that its just as simple as a smile or a hug or 'I love you.'""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHA6Ly9jb2xvcmFkb3N1bi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9jb2xvcmFkby1yYW5jaGVzLXN1cnZpdmFsLXJhbmNobGFuZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colorado ranches are trying to survive. The solution is selling more than beef preserving land for more than cattle.,"Story first appeared in:

PUEBLO COUNTY— Anja Stokes has a load of salt blocks on the flatbed of her pickup truck as it bounces across a prairie dotted with silvery sandsage and cholla cactus blooming in hot pink.

The cattle see her coming and bellow though some refuse to move out of the dirt road until the truck bumper is only inches from their rumps.

The 25-year-old who grew up in Portland and studied international political economy in college slides out of the truck to chuck blocks of minerals and salt near a water trough. Then she rolls up her sleeves to tinker with a water pump so she can fill the metal trough plus a mud-bottomed natural one that has dried up. At sunrise Stokes was on horseback with a handful of other workers at Chico Basin Ranch moving cattle to this pasture where the prairie grasses are higher and greener.

She is an apprentice training to one day run a cattle ranch.

The apprenticeship program at Chico Basin one of five cattle ranches across the West operated by the for-profit Ranchlands company is a key to the future as the decades-old story of handing down family ranches to the next generation fades away. The path forward is visible too in the ranch’s leather belts and bags advertised on Instagram the freezer of hamburger awaiting customer pickup the guest quarters for vacationers who want to experience ranch life and even the kiosk at the front gate where the public can sign in and visit anytime for $15.

It’s the opposite of the old-timey ranch welcome: a no-trespassing sign riddled with bullet holes.

Ranchlands has managed the 90000-acre Chico Basin Ranch and its livestock operations since 1999. Cholla cactus blooming on the Chico Basin Ranch southeast of Colorado Springs.

The whole operation — with two ranches in Colorado and one each in Wyoming New Mexico and Texas — represents a new model one where survival does not depend solely on the unpredictable commodity price of beef.

Ranchlands which leases the Chico Basin Ranch southeast of Colorado Springs from the state land board is finding other ways to make money. Guests from across the globe pay about $2000 per week to wake up at 4:30 a.m. to help mend fences and move cattle then sit by the campfire at sunset the Spanish Peaks to the south and Pikes Peak to the north. A handful of employees cut and stamp leather into belts bracelets hat bands and bags rustic yet stylish products now popping up on Instagram and Facebook ads for Ranchlands Mercantile which expanded in 2020.

This month Ranchlands began selling 1-pound hamburger packages directly to customers who can either pick them up at the ranch or receive them frozen through the mail. The direct sales skip the middleman and the unpredictability of selling cows on the traditional market for whatever is the going price of the day. Ranchlands intends to slaughter 80 to 100 head of cattle for the new meat sales in hopes of growing the business over time by marketing to people willing to pay more — about double at $10 per pound — for beef raised without hormones or vaccines and straight from the ranch where they grazed.

“We are trying to figure out how to propel ranching into the future” said Duke Phillips who grew up on a cattle ranch in Mexico worked on cattle ranches as far away as Australia and is now the CEO of Ranchlands. “Ranching is a very thin-margin business. In order to keep young people in ranching there has to be some way of generating enough income to live.”

The answer he said is in viewing the land multidimensionally as more than a place to raise cattle. Horses hospitality hiking fishing birds leather works photography and art. Those interests tie in naturally to conservation and land stewardship and into educating the public about where their food comes from and what it takes to raise a cow.

“It’s a package that’s already there” Phillips said. “All we have to do is recognize ourselves as conservationists.”

Ranchlands’ leather business started with Phillips who made space for a small leather workshop on all the ranches he worked and then got requests for orders from friends who had seen the bags he made for his daughters. Now Ranchlands partners with the state Department of Corrections where inmates in a Sterling prison are helping produce the company’s leather products. The e-commerce shop also sells scarves straw hats blankets and Western shirts products purchased wholesale from other suppliers.

Phillips 66 and living on Ranchlands’ Wyoming operation called Paintrock Canyon Ranch gets his inspiration from the ranch in rural Mexico where he grew up five hours from town. The ranch run by his father was self-sustaining with its own welder and bootmaker and an on-site store to sell products to the local community.

Phillips’ son also Duke runs Ranchlands’ agricultural operations and his daughter Tess Leach is in charge of the company’s business development. Both live at Chico with their kids where family homes guest quarters and staff bunkhouses are miles apart connected by rough dirt roads.

Land conservation is tied to economic sustainability

The number of cattle ranches across Colorado and the West is shrinking as ranchers sell to developers or consolidate. And it takes far more cattle to turn a profit today than it did a couple decades ago. So as drought low profit margins and the exhaustive sunup-to-sundown work push the next generations to cities cattle ranches are looking for new ways to stay alive. Most ranches nowadays according to the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association are developing other revenue streams often through hunting access.

Ranchlands which leases its Chico Basin ranch from the state and its Zapata Ranch in the San Luis Valley from the nonprofit Nature Conservancy is far from the only one pursuing a future tied to conservation and diversification. The May Ranch raising cattle near Lamar has become an ecological sanctuary preserving habitat for black-footed ferrets ducks and birds earning a lucrative conservation easement and a seal of approval from the Audubon Society that makes the ranch’s beef more valuable. Quivira Coalition a New Mexico-based group of ranchers and environmentalists sends apprentices to ranches across the West including Colorado.

“The things that have worked in ranching for the last 50 or 100 years need to be refreshed for people to succeed for the next 50 or 100 years” said William Burnidge deputy director of the Nature Conservancy’s North American sustainable grazing lands program.

The Nature Conservancy now owns about 60 ranches in the West with a goal of helping ranchers not only raise healthy livestock and protect their livelihoods but preserve natural habitat for wildlife and fish instead of seeing ranchland subdivided into neighborhoods. The organization owns five ranches in Colorado including the Zapata.

“Ranchers really value conservation of natural resources plants animals water resources and open space and it is an economic diversification strategy” Burnidge said. Ranchers can earn tax benefits and other financial incentives through conservation easements another way to diversify their incomes he said. And the economic security coupled with the appeal of “being in nature and watching each day transpire” is what entices the next generation to return — or to begin a new career in agriculture Burnidge said.

“That’s part of the appeal and the passion.”

Flying Diamond Cattle Ranch in Kit Carson has a hunting business and direct meat sales but has focused its economic diversification on cattle. The family-owned ranch founded in 1907 is not only a calf-cow operation selling cows to the beef market but sells pregnant cows and bulls for breeding. The ranch also gets grant funding from the Audubon Society for protecting bird habitat. “You can’t outsmart or outspend nature” ranch owner Jen Livsey said. “Nature always wins in the end. If you can figure out how to match your practices to the environment your bottomline will benefit.”

For Ranchlands which took over the lease for 87000-acre Chico Basin in 1999 what started as a plan to make the lease payment and eventually turn a profit is now what defines the company. “We really want to engage people from all walks of life and ranching so that people can understand what it is that we’re doing” said Leach who lives with her husband and three young sons at Chico.

School kids from Denver the San Luis Valley and beyond visit for field trips learning about beef production leather crafts and prairie and pond ecology. Guests who want to spend their vacation as ranch hands can rent a room in a guest house at Chico a simple one-story home with a screened front porch facing miles and miles of rolling prairie. For those looking for relaxation Ranchlands has guest rooms at its Zapata Ranch tailored to people’s wishes as in “I want to ride with the bison I want to go for a hike I’d love to have a massage and I don’t eat chicken” Leach said.

Ranchlands also takes people fishing and hunting for antelope elk and deer. The Bird Conservancy of the Rockies comes to Chico Basin twice each year to band songbirds and so far has counted 365 species a distinction that draws birders to the property. Recently Ranchlands began selling memberships which come with access to a new company podcast about ranching and conservation plus discounts on meat and store goods.

When it doesn’t rain Ranchlands can sell off cattle instead of pushing the land beyond what’s healthy and fall back on its other streams of income Leach said.

Ranchlands raises Beefmaster cattle a breed that fits with its “from the land for the land” motto animals that are “harmonious with their natural environment.” A cow that gets sick or gets a parasite is removed from the herd not just given a vaccine or medicine. When a calf is eaten by a coyote the ranch doesn’t kill the coyote but sells off the mother cow for not protecting her baby.

“We see ranching as the most compelling solution to large-scale conservation” Leach said. “A rancher is dependent on the land. If we don’t have a healthy landscape then we don’t have a business. So figuring out how to communicate that reality to the public is really the guiding light behind everything that we’re doing.”

Connecting with the land and the public

Stokes a childhood friend of Duke Phillips’ youngest daughter first visited the ranch when she was 11. She was awed by the vastness of it. After college she found her way back there and applied for a Ranchlands’ internship in 2021 then moved into the apprenticeship program.

About 15 people live at Chico Basin including a handful of 20-somethings from cities including Washington D.C. who didn’t know much about riding a horse or laying a water pipeline when they arrived. Each has their own string of three horses — so they don’t wear them out with all the miles it takes to cover the ranch. They also use dirt bikes and pickups to traverse the landscape and a helicopter to herd cattle and get from Chico Basin to Zapata Ranch.

When she started Stokes didn’t know a screw from a bolt she said. When she was out on her own she called the ranch manager regularly to ask questions about water pumps. Now she figures it out.

“I knew how to ride a horse which we definitely don’t require coming into an internship” she said. Others had mechanical skills useful in repairing the dirt bikes. Some are better at building fences.

“Over time you start to be able to do problem-solving like with the water systems” she said before driving to the middle of an empty pasture where a water line leak was creating a giant mud puddle.

“Do you see where it’s bubbling right there?” she asked before jumping from the pickup and dislodging caked mud from a water meter key so she could shut off a section of pipeline. “It’s huge oh my gosh.”

In the past year as an apprentice Stokes has seen all four seasons on the sandsage prairie — the coldest she’s ever been was tearing across the flatlands on a dirt bike in the dead of winter. Summers are the best when she and other ranch hands swim in the five spring-fed lakes on the property or hike in the Spanish Peaks near La Veta. At some point she hopes to manage one of Ranchlands’ livestock operations or at least have a career in land management.

The public connection including the nights when she makes tacos or grills steaks for tourists staying in the guest quarters is one of the most important aspects of her job Stokes said.

“A lot of people have no idea where their food comes from” she said. “Not everyone has the opportunity to come visit one of these ranches and get to experience firsthand what we’re doing but they can read about it they can watch videos about it and consume the products that we’re raising which is really cool.”

WASHINGTON: Biden administration officials and oil industry executives huddled in Washington to discuss potential steps to address runaway gasoline prices and while both sides called the talks constructive no concrete plans for relief emerged. High prices at the pump are weighing on American consumers - and damaging President Joe Biden's approval rating. Heading into the gathering Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said she hoped the meeting would result in refiners boosting gasoline supplies to lower prices for the summer vacation driving season.

Afterwards the Energy Department said the talks had had a ""productive focus on dissecting the current global problems of supply and refining"" and promised ""ongoing dialogue"" to ""alleviate the current supply and price challenges."" Similarly the American Petroleum Institute and American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers called the meeting a ""constructive discussion about ways to address rising energy costs and create more certainty for global energy markets.""

Chevron Phillips 66 and Shell all released upbeat statements with Shell US President Gretchen Watkins praising Granholm for setting a ""collaborative tone"" by noting that Shell and others had shifted some refining capacity to produce biofuels. But no practical steps to immediately boost supply were revealed. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the gathering a ""first step."" ""Clearly we want to come up with solutions"" Jean-Pierre told a press briefing. ""There's going to be other steps to get there.""

Uneasy ties

Biden and the oil industry have an uneasy relationship in part over the White House's efforts to restrict drilling in some federal areas due to environmental concerns and decisions like canceling the Keystone pipeline project on his first day in office. The US president has also blasted industry leaders in recent days over skyrocketing profits and their reluctance to boost capital spending. Industry leaders released a letter to Biden ahead of Thursday's meeting that alluded to his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia urging him to visit US refineries and other industry sites to understand the potential for ""American-made energy solutions."" But with Biden's approval ratings plunging due to soaring inflation the president has turned to the industry for relief.

Short-term solutions?

Gasoline prices currently stand at $4.94 a gallon a bit below all-time highs but up more than 60 percent from the year-ago level. In a letter earlier this month to oil giants Biden said high fuel prices were a key factor in the ""intense financial pain the American people and their families are bearing."" He urged ExxonMobil Chevron and other industry players to ""provide concrete near-term solutions that address the crisis.""

In response Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth pledged to work with the administration but faulted Biden's comments that ""at times vilify"" the industry - drawing a Biden quip that Wirth was being ""mildly sensitive."" The price surge follows Russia's invasion of Ukraine which exacerbated an already tight energy supply situation sending crude oil prices sharply higher. The rise in prices also reflects the diminished state of refining capacity after the industry mothballed some plants during Covid-19 lockdowns and did not reopen them amid uncertain long-term growth prospects with the buildup of electric vehicles.

Biden's policy thus far has centered on a huge increase in crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. On Wednesday the US president proposed a temporary fuel tax break a measure that received a lukewarm reception on Capitol Hill. For energy specialist Andrew Lebow of the Commodity Research Group consultancy ""there is very little refiners can do at this point."" ""If they could produce more certainly they would be given that the margins are incredible"" he said.

On Wednesday Granholm acknowledged that building new refineries could not be done overnight but said the administration wanted answers about plants that had been taken offline. She also wanted to talk about supply chain issues questioning if the industry could help on that front. Kevin Book head of research at Clearview Energy Partners said there were areas where the government could provide aid such as facilitating procurement of truck drivers and sand for fracking. Adopting a broadly constructive tone on regulation could also boost investment he said. - AFP",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3NlbnRpYWxseXNwb3J0cy5jb20vdXMtc3BvcnRzLW5ld3Mtc3dpbW1pbmctbmV3cy1pLXdhcy1hZnJhaWQtdG8tc2hvdy1taWNoYWVsLXBoZWxwcy11bm1hc2tlZC1oaXMtcmVhbC1zZWxmLWFmdGVyLWEtaGFyc2gtcmVhbGl0eS1jaGVjay1pbi1zaG93ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“I Was Afraid to Show..”- Michael Phelps Unmasked His Real Self After a Harsh Reality Check in Shower,"Self-realization strikes like lightning.

Michael Phelps had a breakthrough in the shower

According to Phelps the biggest hindrance to his growth in therapy was that “I was afraid to show who I was so I had all these personas.” However one day while he was showering he realized “Oh my God do these people think I’m annoying? Do they not want to be around me? Then I thought Why do I care? If I talk too much if I laugh really loud or if I’m hyper at times or a real pain in the ass at the end of the day why does it really matter?”

That was the moment of self-realization for the swimming legend.

Phelps further added “Right then and there it was like there’s no point for me to try to be somebody I’m not. This is who I am.”

Phelps received a wholehearted support from people around him

Perhaps Phelps is lucky to have a great bunch of people around him who comforted him during the days when everything seemed lost. His wife his coach Bowman his mother and even his estranged father – everyone was there for him when he needed them the most. Not to forget he has some really cool people on his friends’ tab including NFL legend Ray Lewis and Australian swimmer Grant Hackett.

INDIANAPOLIS — IMPD homicide detectives are investigating a Sunday morning shooting that left a man dead and a woman seriously wounded on the city's southeast side.

The Marion County Coroner's Office identified the man as 23-year-old Kyson Ward.

According to an IMPD spokesman Ward and woman were found outside a duplex in the 1500 block of Renton Street near Keystone Avenue and Minnesota Street shortly after 8 a.m.

Medics pronounced Ward dead at the scene.

The woman was taken to Eskenazi Hospital in critical condition. She was later upgraded to serious but stable condition by medical staff.

Authorities have not shared her name.

Police have not released what led up to the shooting but believe it was preceded by a disturbance of some type. IMPD said investigators don't believe there is an immediate threat to the area or that this was a random act.

No suspect information has been shared by investigators.

This shooting follows another deadly shooting that happened less than 12 hours prior.

A man was shot at a gas station on the near northeast side of Indianapolis at around 10 p.m. Saturday.

Police said the man was found critically wounded outside a Phillips 66 gas station located at the corner of 34th Street and Keystone Avenue.

He was taken to the hospital in critical condition and died shortly after arriving.

Anyone with information about the Renton Street shooting is being asked to contact Det. Michael Condon at the IMPD Homicide Office at 317-327-3475 or Michael.Condon@indy.gov.

Anyone with information about the 34th Street and Keystone Avenue shooting should contact Detective Larry Craciunoiu at the IMPD homicide office at 317-327-3475 or e-mail him at Larry.Craciunoiu@indy.gov."

The 2023 girls and boys state basketball tournament will have a new format for the third year in a row.

This time around the NSAA is hoping it's found something that sticks.

While a three-day tournament had been the norm in previous years the NSAA on Friday approved a change to a four-day state tournament format at its monthly board of directors meeting.

Each of the girls and boys state basketball tournaments will now run from Wednesday to Saturday with a day of rest for the classes that begin play on Wednesday.

Notably Lincoln Public Schools sites will no longer be used for any state basketball contests other than third-place games. Fan experience including seating limits and parking availability was a major consideration in the NSAA's decision to move contests out of the LPS gyms.

Instead Pinnacle Bank Arena and the Devaney Sports Center will host all of the state tournament games.

“These kids deserve to play in a championship venue and it’s Pinnacle Bank Arena and Devaney that are the championship venues"" said board member Ryan Ruhl during the open comment session.

A survey sent out to member schools following the April board of directors meeting revealed a preference for the four-day format rather than the traditional three days. According to NSAA executive director Jay Bellar roughly 60% of schools supported the four-day format while 40% preferred three days of competition.

The NSAA is also hoping that increased attendance revenue at the larger arenas will help offset the cost of renting Devaney for two additional days. Bellar said that renting two LPS sites for a day had cost roughly $8000 while renting Devaney for a day costs $30000.

“The tradeoff is financial but I think the image and convenience of getting fans into those venues speak volumes"" board member Bob Reznicek said.

Future considerations for the NSAA include how district speech contests will be affected by the new format and how to rotate which classes start their state tournament journey on Wednesday as opposed to Thursday.

Sandy’s Deputy Fire Chief Ryan McConaghie told Gephardt Daily on scene that firefighters were dispatched to Pinnacles Gymnastics at 9127 S. 255 West about 8 p.m. When crews arrived they could see smoke and flames “coming out of the side” of the 10000-square-foot business.

“The owner was inside with his daughter doing some welding. The welding kind of got away from them and got onto some of the mats and the flammable equipment around him before he realized what was going on” McConaghie said.

“He tried to hit it with an extinguisher and it quickly spread. He called 911 and got out of the structure.

“They suffered a little minor bit of smoke inhalation” and were being treated at the hospital McConaghie said.

“This quickly evolved into a second and then a third alarm fire where we have about 15 to 17 units on scene. I’d say 45 or so firefighters are working on all sides of this building in total.

“It’s about a 25000-square-foot structure. The Pinnacles’ portion of it is about 10000 square feet” McConaghie said.

“And you can see they’re still working on it … meaning that they are sending people inside … making sure that it’s not spreading and then just trying to get into a position where they can attack that fire safely.”

McConaghie said Pinnacle’s roof was compromised “and we’re not putting any people on top of it. Obviously this is still a work in progress. They’re trying to get to where they can find the hotspots.”

First responders from agencies in Sandy Murray South Jordan West Jordan Draper and Unified District joined in the firefighting effort. “It’s pretty much everybody that surrounds Sandy has come to help out you know with it being a third alarm fire so lots of people are here working trying to be safe.

“There’s nobody inside. There’s no big hurry to try to rush in there and do anything so it’s pointless to risk any injury or anything like that. We’re just being cautious and treating it as a defensive fire.”

When asked about the nature of the fire Deputy Chief McConaghie said “It’s just always a good reminder when you’re doing work and that sort of thing have a spotter … especially when you’re doing any kind of ‘hot work’ like welding.

“It was probably a big surprise when he flipped his mask up and saw that that fire had started burning so quickly. So yeah it’s a good idea to use a spotter clear any type of conduction combustibles away from where you’re working.”

While the damage is extensive inside Pinnacles the other business spaces inside the complex suffered mostly smoke damage.

The smoke from the fire was seen for miles. Among those who witnessed the rising column of black billowing smoke were the Real Salt Lake soccer fans inside the crowded Rio Tinto Stadium. Play was not affected.

Total damage estimates have yet to be determined.

The official cause of the fire remains under investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0c3Rhci50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vY3JpY2tldC8xOTgzLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1maW5hbC1pbmRpYS12cy13ZXN0LWluZGllcy1rYXBpbC1kZXYtNzUteWVhcnMtb2YtaW5kZXBlbmRlbmNlLWljb25pYy1tb21lbnRzLWluZGlhbi1zcG9ydHMvYXJ0aWNsZTM4NTA1NzE2LmVjZdIBqQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0c3Rhci50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vY3JpY2tldC8xOTgzLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1maW5hbC1pbmRpYS12cy13ZXN0LWluZGllcy1rYXBpbC1kZXYtNzUteWVhcnMtb2YtaW5kZXBlbmRlbmNlLWljb25pYy1tb21lbnRzLWluZGlhbi1zcG9ydHMvYXJ0aWNsZTM4NTA1NzE2LmVjZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,75 years of independence 75 iconic moments from Indian sports: No. 25 - Kapil Dev's India lifts the 1983 World Cup,"India will complete 75 years of independence this year. Here is a series acknowledging 75 great sporting achievements by Indian athletes. Sportstar will present one iconic sporting achievement each day leading up to August 15 2022.

India climbs pinnacle of glory

This was the roseate day of the apotheosis of Indian cricket. The day on which the World Cup was won by a team which was until then as remote from the zenith of achievement in limited-over cricket as the traditional is from the modern.

In a match filled with dramatics that came in waves created to a large extent by insipid batting from the challenger as well as the defending champion India proved itself capable of keeping its nerves together and cashing in on the openings that were first given and then seized.

As fortunes fluctuated wildly at Lord's the West Indian batting let down by its specialists who tossed away their wickets could not cope with the efficient and accurate Indian bowling. The principle of blending aggression with caution to suit the gameplan of striking from a position of strength was foresaken by both teams in sudden and thoughtless assaults on the bowling which picked up in efficiency levels from every gain.

In splendid batting conditions only Kris Srikkanth (38) and Viv Richards (33) kept above the low average. India got over the initial stress of quick bowling that made use of the freshness of the wicket and early bounce and yet could not make a total to fight such a side.

The West Indians on the other hand lost wickets at frequent intervals and once Richards - Kapil Dev running from midwicket with his back to the pitch for a good 15 yards took the catch with impeccable judgement off Madan Lal's bowling - and Clive Lloyd fell there was no one capable of counterattacking.

Captain Kapil who kept alternating between attack and defence did everything right. Running the bowling changes effectively when Jeffrey Dujon and Malcolm Marshall fought to resurrect the position (76 for six) with a 43-run stand the Indian captain achieved a vital breakthrough by employing Mohinder Amarnath. Dujon was done in by an in-cutter that went off the inside face of the bat and onto the leg stump.

The bowlers particularly Lal and Amarnath responded to the skipper's call with a tight line and length and the West Indian batting weaknesses that had been glossed over by the form of the top-order batsmen were exposed for only the second time in history.

Only once before had the West Indies been shot out for less in a one-day international - 127 by England in Berbice in 1980.

The historic win finally came when Holding aiming a wild pull off Amarnath was caught plumb in front.

India won by a substantial margin of 43 runs with Amarnath adjudged man-of-the-match for his figures of 7-0-12-3.

Kapil Dev's rescue act at Tunbridge Wells

It was simply the single biggest individual contribution to a team's win in a World Cup. The garden of England Kent became Kapil Dev's yard of fame. No praise could be high enough for a stupendous batting effort that took the Indians from the horrendous depths of 17 for five to a total of 266 - India's best in a World Cup - that could not have been imagined as possible once Peter Rawson and Kevin Curran exploited a soft pitch and indecisive and weak batting.

Kapil would have been crucified had India tumbled and dropped all its chances in the World Cup. It was a difficult decision to take that of batting first but the issue had been pre-determined by India's run rate. The least the early Indian batsmen could have done was to wriggle past the first few overs with minimal loss but in the shambles Yashpal Sharma's nine was the highest score in 17.

Considering that the next highest score on the card was Syed Kirmani's 26 Kapil's 175 assumes a dimension almost above human possibility. He achieved it in what was easily the finest innings he has ever played in his remarkable career. Safe play was the first demand. Kapil met it with resolute defence and admirable choice of the ball for the drive.

Roger Binny was the first to promise some support. Madan Lal and Kirmani followed suit but this was a one man crusade from the start. When Kapil is meeting them off the meat there is very little any bowler can do. The tormentors became the tormented soon as Kapil swung into Rawson Curran and John Traicos with a vengeance striking 16 fours with delectable flicks and full-blooded drives.

The action hotted up once Rawson tired. The Nevill ground with its spread of hospitality tents and rhododendrons suddenly looked too small as Kapil repeatedly pulled and ondrove for a total of six sixes. His first 50 took him 26 overs his second 13 and the third just 11. There was a stirring round of applause when Kapil crossed 171 and he turned to ask Barrie Meyer what it was all about. Kapil was briefed about the record of Glenn Turner he had placed in the pale.

Kapil's innings picked up as the pitch played easier and there was not a semblance of a mishit apart from clean lofts that just failed to clear the fence and tantalisingly out of reach of scrambling deep fielders. Against the most athletic and best all-round fielding side Kapil made his runs. With the scores juggling their figures no one knew how many balls Kapil faced for this mammoth effort. At a fair guess he must have used up 190 to 200 of the 300 that were bowled while he was in from the start of the 11th over to the final ball.

This is one way to have a unique wedding setting.

A woman bought an abandoned bank last year with plans to renovate it into a stunning venue.

On TikTok she’s been documenting the progress – and it’s looking good so far.

Kate Dear from Maryland US bought a former PNC Bank in downtown Frederick which had been vacant for seven years.

The 36-year-old made the purchase in 2021 and in the past has taken on similar projects with a car dealership and a brick warehouse.

Both were transformed into ballroom-style wedding venues.

With her most recent buy it was originally built by the Citizens National Bank in 1886 before being reconstructed in 1909.

The bank’s interior boasts high ceilings real marble walls mosaic floors and delicate gold finishes. What’s more the building’s original bank vaults have also been left intact.

Outside there are imposing limestone columns in Neoclassical style and a balustrade along a terrace roof.

But sadly as the building was modernised many of the other original features were redesigned.

‘It was in pretty good shape albeit in need of a good cleaning with only some minor water damage in a few spots’ Kate told NeedToKnow.online.

‘It’s so solidly built limestone marble bronze finishes that it really held up well to neglect. But it was decorated in a very dated way – mustard yellow and green everywhere.’

Kate began by removing the carpet repairing water damage and restoring the walls. Next she made a new staircase to replicate the original capturing some of the 1909 character.

Overall it’s taken nine months to complete.

Sharing the floor’s transformation with her followers on TikTok (@thevenueceo) Kate revealed how difficult this part was.

She started with a floor stripper and scraping away thick layers of adhesive.

Soon original mosaic floors underneath were revealed.

One user commented: ‘Who would cover those beautiful floors?’

‘The difference at the end – amazing!’ said another.

‘Nothing better than lifting the sheets off of history’ said one person.

‘This is in my hometown! This town has a lot of history – I was sad to see that building just sitting there thank you for giving it the love it needed!’ commented someone else.

Kate said: ‘Our most impactful renovation was a fresh coat of white paint.

‘We left the original gold details from the ceiling intact but painted everything else white. We have redone the tile in the main level and mezzanine.

‘We are also restoring the original marble mosaic tile in the side rooms on the main level by hand adding a sprinkler system redoing the restrooms and getting the building up to code for a venue which means lots of safety updates.’

The finished venue will include a large white marble ball room and reception rooms.

Kate added: ‘I’m in absolute love with it. We have more than 40 clients already and they’re all very excited to see it finished.’

The former bank is due to host its first wedding this month.

A subsidiary of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union plunked down the cash for the two-bedroom condo at 325 Fifth Ave. in 2017 city records show.

The 41-story building at 32nd Street includes a swimming pool spa and screening room.

The purchase was made by the RWDSU Realty Corp. without any oversight from the union’s executive board according to Ted Hunt who heads a union local in Michigan and is seeking to oust Appelbaum as president.

“Somehow spending union money on a lavish lifestyle while we are losing members is somehow acceptable and condoned by the existing leadership. I am sure that our membership would find this lavish spending morally corrupt” Hunt says on his SaveThe RWDSU website.

He told The Post that the board only approved the purchase after a former union official Allen Mayne alerted the federal Department of Labor which opened a probe.

Mayne who had been director of collective bargaining told The Post he was illegally terminated from the union and then reached a settlement agreement with it.

Appelbaum in an April 2022 memo said a “disgruntled former employee” made “baseless allegations” about the union’s operations that were investigated by the DOL. He said the agency found no wrongdoing and closed the case.

As proof he enclosed a letter from the Cozen O’Connor law firm which the union hired saying the matter was closed.

“The Department of Labor has not provided any documentation saying they were cleared of anything” Hunt disputed.

A Labor Department spokesman did not return a request for comment from The Post.

The union said the condo was purchased with proceeds from the sale of another property and was considered an investment.

“The RWDSU has a long and successful history of growing union funds by smartly investing in real estate through the RWDSU Realty Corp” Appelbaum said in a statement to The Post. “This arrangement put the union in its best financial shape ever and will enable the union to fund organizing efforts for years to come.”

A union spokeswoman said the apartment was used by out-of-town union officers and staff when they come to New York for business and had resulted in “significant savings” in hotel and meal costs.

The union’s expense for the apartment in yearly property taxes alone are $34385 city records show.

Appelbaum 69 a member of the Democratic National Committee has headed the 50000-member union since 1998.

He was considered instrumental in killing Amazon’s plan to open a second headquarters in Long Island City that would have created 25000 jobs. Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office blasted the RWDSU after the deal fell through in 2019 even though Appelbaum was one of Cuomo’s biggest supporters.

That led him to hanging out at the race track pool halls and the Vancouver Stock Exchange.

Roxy as he came to be known worked as a bookie taking bets on NHL and NFL games. He'd spend time at Seymour Billiards on Seymour and Nelson streets and various dives — the kind of places he said that still had spittoons for people who chewed tobacco.

In those days Roxborough couldn't have imagined sports betting would be legal in Canada with ads for gambling websites airing during the Stanley Cup finals. He also couldn't have guessed he would play a role in building sports betting into a multibillion-dollar industry one that some critics say comes with significant social costs.

Roxborough says he was a ""smalltime bookmaker"" in those days. He earned extra money driving a cab and selling alcohol out of a cab trunk on Sundays when liquor stores were closed.

Through a personal connection he set up an office at Vancouver's notorious stock exchange which Forbes Magazine once dubbed the "" scam capital of the world .""

Experts worry about influence of Ontario’s sports betting ads Duration 2:01 Sports betting ads are popping up everywhere across Ontario leaving some experts concerned they could reach audiences outside the province and entice them to play on unregulated gambling sites.

Roxborough said the VSE which later merged into the Canadian Venture Exchange was a perfect place to take wagers given the highly speculative nature of the stocks that traded there.

""You could buy a stock in the morning and you could quadruple your money and after you came back from lunch it wasn't trading anymore"" he said.

Calculating the odds

When he started as a bookie Roxborough would call Las Vegas — always from a payphone out of fear of wiretaps — to get the daily odds put out by the Churchill Downs sports book.

For each sporting event bookmakers set a point spread which consists of the number of points a team perceived to be the favourite must win by in order to cash a ticket. The goal is to attract an equal number of bets on both sides — the favourite and the underdog — with oddsmakers profiting by charging a fee known as the vigorish or ""vig.""

Spreads are often adjusted depending on betting activity and news related to the game.

Scott Schettler who worked at Churchill Downs says good information was hard to find in the '70s. He used to have cleaners at the Las Vegas airport collect newspapers from airplanes so he could read sports sections from around the country for any updates.

After stern warnings from Vancouver police Roxborough moved to Nevada in 1975. Schettler later hired him to set odds at the prestigious Stardust Casino and he thrived.

""I respected his numbers more than anybody"" Schettler said of Roxborough.

Roxborough opened Las Vegas Sports Consultants which would go on to provide odds for casinos around the world.

He took a data-driven approach to oddsmaking using computers to gather and analyze information. He also used technology to distribute lines and info to casinos. Tech also allowed casinos to expand their betting menus to include more esoteric sporting events.

Roxborough sold the company in the late '90s but not before setting the table for the current generation of oddsmakers who rely heavily on algorithms.

""Well somebody had to do it first"" he said. ""I think we had a pretty big influence on a lot of bookmakers.""

Canada's big bet on sports

Now 71 Roxborough has watched sports betting move from smoke-filled pool halls to the mainstream.

Last year Canada passed Bill C-218 allowing for single-game betting in an effort to redirect money from offshore sites into provincial government coffers. Before then only multi-event bets called parlays were allowed.

A Deloitte Canada report suggested that the sports betting industry could grow from $500 million to $28 billion within five years of nationwide legalization in 2021.

Ontario allowed for multiple operators in a provincially regulated market back in April. Since then betting ads intended for Ontario audiences have appeared on screens in other provinces.

Online betting sites licensed in Ontario are not licensed to operate in B.C.

The B.C. Lottery Corporation started taking single-game wagers back in August through its Playnow website. BCLC says it remains the only place where British Columbians can legally place an online sports bet.

Roxborough says corporate and government interests need to consider the wider implications of sports betting or they could face a public backlash.

""I think there has to be some conscience driving the industry… and I don't know where that comes from"" he said.

The lure of gambling

Roxborough fell in love with gambling at what is now Hastings Racecourse in East Vancouver. He saw gambling as a glamorous alternative to the drudgery of a nine-to-five job.

""You could go out at night drink wake up play read the sports sections read the daily racing form make your money and have a nice lifestyle"" he said.

While Roxborough was first exposed to gambling at the race track a new generation is learning about it through advertising.

Luke Clark with the University of British Columbia's Centre for Gambling Research says ads can contribute to the normalization of sports betting.

""For young people in particular it creates a norm where sports and gambling are very tightly connected and I think that's a development where we need to tread very carefully"" he said.

Clark notes that there are supports in place for problem gamblers including a program where they can voluntarily exclude themselves from gambling facilities.



Roxborough says the romance of gambling is an illusion. Most gamblers lose money. The few who make a living at it are locked in an endless cat-and-mouse game with oddsmakers each mining data to find the slightest edge. In the end what seems like an exciting escape is just a business like any other.

""When I went to Las Vegas the idea was to escape conventional work"" he said. ""It turns out you have to spend 60 to 70 hours a week to escape a 40-hour job.""",,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

(June 25 2022) – A rejuvenated Brandon Robinson (No. 44 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) earned his first victory of the 2022 Progressive American Flat Track season in Saturday’s Mission Lima Half-Mile at the Allen County Fairgrounds in Lima Ohio.

Over the few several seasons Robinson has established himself as the Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle rider most likely to steal the occasional win away from class dominators Jared Mees (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) and Briar Bauman (No. 3 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750).

However on this night Robinson had to overcome the challenge of the series’ newest star in Dallas Daniels (No. 32 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) to get to the checkered flag first. The rookie looked to be the race favorite prior to the Main but gave himself a big task by getting shuffled down from pole to sixth at the start.

So instead it was Daniels’ teammate JD Beach (No. 95 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) who took point early on despite searching for pace all day long. Beach actually gapped the field by nearly a second in the early going before the likes of Robinson Bauman Mees and Daniels really got rolling.

Robinson was the first one by and built up a one-a-half-second lead of his own by the time Daniels arrived in second with some six minutes remaining on the clock. The Yamaha pilot steadily ate away at that gap drawing near enough to crisscross in front of Robinson momentarily with his low-to-high line with less than three minutes remaining.

The Mission Roof Systems rider was up for the challenge adjusting his line to tighten his grip on the race. Daniels eventually conceded allowing Robinson to secure the win with a 2.766-second margin of victory.

The breakthrough was Robinson’s second Lima triumph the first coming back in 2016. Afterward he said “We needed this. This year has been an absolute struggle for us… My team hasn’t given up and they gave me a great motorcycle. All the guys pitch in and make this fun. Man I needed this big. I can’t wait to go to the next one now.”

Reigning champion and current points leader Mees worked his way past Bauman late to round out the podium while Beach came home in fifth behind the two works Indian runners. Mees’ championship advantage was reduced slightly as a result; he now leads Daniels 139-127 while Bauman (115) and Beach (112) remain solidly in contention.

Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Latus Motors Racing Harley-Davidson XG750R) finished in sixth just ahead of Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) and Davis Fisher (No. 67 Bob Lanphere’s BMC Racing Indian FTR750).

Cory Texter (No. 100 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07) was the top Mission Production Twins Challenge entrant in ninth while Brandon Price (No. 92 Pro One Industries/Mission Foods KTM Duke 890) rounded out the top ten in his first ride aboard the KTM.

Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

In recent weeks defending Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines champion Cory Texter (No. 1 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07) has been quietly keeping his hopes for a third and final class crown alive by clawing his way to gritty seconds thirds and fourths on nights he just didn’t have the speed to contend for the win.

Texter was anything but quiet on Saturday night at Allen County Fairgrounds however registering a lopsided victory to narrow the gap to title leader Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) to just a single point (132-131).

Texter Janisch and Ben Lowe (No. 25 Mission Foods/Roof Systems Harley-Davidson XG750R) exploited the multiple nature of the circuit to each take a turn at the lead on the opening lap of the Main Event. But by lap two Texter had seized control and he would never relent.

Janisch both kept Texter honest and minimized the damage with a steady ride to second at a track he’s never completely gelled with.

The win was Texter’s second of the season and his (and Yamaha’s) first ever at Lima. He said “I’ve been coming here since I was two years old – maybe younger. Last year I was all angry on the podium. I knew I could do better here. I rode really hard at the beginning and then just brought it home. This is my last Lima and this is one I’m going to miss. It’s such an iconic track. It feels amazing to finally win here.”

Billy Ross (No. 109 Mission Foods/Roof Systems Harley-Davidson XG750R) proved his win at Laconia was no fluke by following up that maiden victory with a second-career podium. It didn’t come easily however as he only just managed to fend off a charging Cameron Smith (No. 34 Thee Cathy Gray/Al Barker Yamaha MT-07).

Smith who boasted terrific speed all day encountered unwelcome bike issues just prior to the start and was forced to move to the back of the grid. Despite that Smith powered through the pelting roost of the field to finish in fourth just over a half-second back of the box.

Cole Zabala (No. 51 Memphis Shades/Corbin/Vinson Yamaha MT-07) finished another two seconds back equaling his best finish of the year in fifth.

Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER

With each successive race Kody Kopp (No. 12 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) continues to further the case that he’s the odds-on favorite to claim this year’s Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER crown.

At Lima Kopp scored a second consecutive blowout victory his fourth win among six top-twos in just seven attempts this season. The emerging superstar gapped the field within a single lap and then piled it on from there ultimately winning with more than four seconds in hand.

Kopp’s mastery was reminiscent of that of his father 2000 Grand National Champion Joe Kopp who won at the circuit three times.

The secret? Kody said “Holeshots win races here especially in this Lima pea-gravel. So we did our job and got a good start and that’s pretty much all we had to do honestly.”

While there was little drama in deciding the podium the race still proved to be a spectacular showcase for the future stars of the sport. Joining 17-year-old Kopp in the spotlight were a pair of 16-year-old phenoms.

Australian Tom Drane (No. 359 Construction Supply Specialists/ICCONS KTM 450 SX-F) earned a remarkable runner-up result in his Progressive AFT debut while Rookie of the Year hopeful Chase Saathoff (No. 106 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) scooped up his second consecutive third-place finish.

No other rider finished within 16 seconds of the runaway Kopp.

Dalton Gauthier (No. 79 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) came home fourth while James Ott (No. 19 MediaHT/G&G Racing KTM 450 SX-F) won out in a tight scrap for fifth ahead of Trevor Brunner (No. 21 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) and Morgen Mischler (No. 13 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R).

As a result of Kopp’s win and Mischler’s seventh Kopp now boasts a rather hefty 31-point advantage (155-134) in a quickly tilting title fight.

Public health specialists and advisors to the World Health Organisation Asian Development Bank and World Bank came together at the Commonwealth People’s Forum in Kigali Rwanda to discuss how the coalition of 54 Commonwealth member states can advance health justice.

It’s the first time Commonwealth civil society has convened in four years at this scale owing to the pandemic with the discussion spanning improving solidarity between Commonwealth countries and pandemic preparedness.

In particular advocates agreed on next steps for tackling global health emergencies focusing on progressive taxation as vital to achieving universal health coverage:

Resilient health systems

Dr Ravi Rannan-Eliya a Sri Lankan physician and economist and consultant for both the World Bank and Asian Development Bank said:

""In most Commonwealth countries we don't have insurance we rely on taxation.…We have to get the well-off to pay more in taxes…And you can't build resilient health systems unless you use public financing. That means government taxation or mandatory social insurance which requires government intervention. Why is this a solidarity issue? It's a solidarity issue because both those things require you to take money from the better off to provide services for the vulnerable.""

Dr Justice Koonin Australian HIV advocate and co-chair of the Universal Health Coverage 2030 campaign group agreed and added that civil society must play an advocacy role to ensure marginalised groups aren’t left behind:

""There's a statement in the 2019 WHO declaration calling for all governments to increase public health spending on primary health care by 1% of GDP — that's the bare minimum. And this must be achieved through progressive taxation. It's difficult politically but that's why civil society needs to be there. Because universal health coverage isn't universal health coverage if it doesn't apply to prisoners and refugees if we're not talking about LGBT people. If we provide health care services to everyone else but not those people that's not universal health coverage.""

Civil society

Professor Senait Fisseha Chief Advisor to the WHO Director-General world-renowned physician and leader in reproductive health and rights from Ethiopia explained what’s at stake if public financing of healthcare systems isn’t prioritised in the Commonwealth:

'""The global system failed people especially vulnerable marginalised communities. People in sub-Saharan Africa were scrambling for vaccines. So governments do need to prioritise healthcare investments. The Abuja declaration was for African nations to increase 15% of our GDP into health. Only two countries in sub-Saharan Africa Rwanda and South Africa have done that. Many of us are investing very small amounts. So there’s a question of how do we increase domestic resources to ensure we have a very strong primary health care system.""

Dr Ravi Rannan-Eliya gave an example of how to achieve this citing an example of when the UK public resoundingly supported higher taxation to make their National Health System stronger in the midst of a global recession and at a time when spending was frozen.

He adds this was driven by civil society — with the British Medical Association and other health unions undertaking strategic polling of voters and taking this evidence to the UK government.

""Healthcare spending was the only item of the budget that was increased [by the UK government] at that time. So this is an example of civil society at its best. That's what I would call for in your own country.’""

Wade ruling.

The rights and progress we have achieved as feminist movement in the world are now threatened. A few hours ago the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the historic ruling of Roe v. Wade of 1973 determining that abortion is no longer a constitutional right and allowing each state in the country to regulate and even prohibit abortion.

This represents an advance of the conservative and right-wing sectors in the world making this ruling part of the onslaught against our rights. We know that our capacity for mobilization and transformation is opposed by these conservative and misogynist agendas which attack and question not only the legalization of abortion but also the right to a non-sexist education equal marriage the fight against male violence and other legislative advancements that represent the expansion of rights for our societies as a whole.

Fifty years ago the North American feminist movement as well as that of other countries pushed forward an advanced agenda on sexual reproductive and non-reproductive rights which had an impact on a continental and global level. Those of us who recognize ourselves as feminists know that what we have achieved has been the result of the great massiveness of our slogans and the political struggle on an international scale. For this reason in recent years in the midst of the conservative and right-wing offensive it was the feminist movements –particularly in Latin America– that showed the capacity to resist and to build a profoundly democratic and emancipatory horizon of transformation.

We are certain that these attacks on gender agendas have other underlying interests: they seek to curtail our democracies in the name of freedom attacking social and political rights particularly those that promote equality.

We call upon ourselves as feminists from different parts of the world to be in a state of alert making it clear that we will be more united than ever. We are convinced that the struggle for our emancipation can only be collective and international and that to defend our rights is to fight for equality.

Netizens criticised the agent for being “cheapskate” saying the move to take back the balloon was “lowly”.

But insurance agents and financial advisers CNA spoke to were divided on the issue with some disapproving of the agent's behaviour while others said it was understandable.

This is because expenses for roadshows such as rent logistic costs and freebies typically come out of the agents’ own pockets.

“I’m not surprised to see agents behaving like that because as much as they want to earn a proper living they must protect themselves” said Jack (not his real name) who has been an agent for two years.

“It’s all from their own pocket. If they don’t manage it well it’s easy for them to get into financial difficulties.

“I do know there are consultants facing financial difficulties that’s the reason why they got a little desperate and resorted to this to reduce costs … The Internet says this person is cheap but it really depends on perspective.”

Roadshow costs differ based on factors such as location and the type of freebies but participating in one can set you back by S$100 a day on average according to agents.

Another financial adviser who only wanted to be known as Gary added that though agencies may co-sponsor the event agents still have to fork out some money on their own.

Rent is also higher these days said Gary who has been in the industry for 14 years.

He added that agents participating in roadshows tend to be junior ones or fresh graduates trying to build their networks.

GENEROSITY IS IMPORTANT

Guidelines by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) state that financial institutions should ensure any gifts offered to customers do not ""unduly influence"" their decisions to purchase any financial product or service.

But beyond that there is no specific advice on the giving out or retracting of freebies.

Since it is a ""grey area"" agents often defer to their mentors especially if roadshow costs are split among a group of agents said insurance agent Han Yao Fong.

But in such a case generosity is sometimes the key he said.

“You give a bit you get a bit more back. This kind of small money don’t think so much don't be so calculative” said Mr Han who has been an agent for five years.

For instance giving the balloon in such an instance might allow him to build rapport with a prospect.

“If we vibe well I can give you my name card. If you like me we can meet for coffee … If I make new friends it means I have a new contact in my list.

“If the time comes (when the person is) ready he'll get something from me and if he finds my service is good he’ll refer people to me. It’s a very friendly cycle.”

Amanda (not her real name) who has been an agent for less than a year had similar views.

“I strongly believe that building human relationships is far more important than selling a product.

""I definitely wouldn't entrust my money to someone with little social awareness and clearly only cares about their own self-interests.”

The agent could have also done better by being ""more upfront"" and explaining the situation more clearly said Gary.

ENSURING AGENTS FOLLOW GUIDELINES

He also noted that the incident has unfairly generated backlash towards insurance agents and financial advisers as a whole.

“Maybe 95 per cent of us are doing work through referrals and proper financial planning but the incident puts practitioners in a bad light” Gary said.

Insurance firms and industry associations that CNA contacted did not provide statistics on complaints about agents’ marketing activities.

But in response to queries AIA Singapore said it takes customers’ feedback seriously and will investigate the conduct of its representatives when required.

It added that its roadshow guidelines are aligned with MAS’ standards of conduct for marketing and distribution activities.

“We recognise that it is an ongoing effort to maintain and elevate the standards of professionalism from our representatives and we will continue to do regular reviews and updates of our internal processes accordingly.”

Prudential another major insurer said its financial consultants are aware of the standards of conduct to follow and these are communicated through induction programmes and training.

Consultants must also pass assessments on sales advisory standards before they can participate in roadshows.

“We also conduct checks to ensure that (consultants) comply with the roadshow guidelines and follow up if there is any feedback on non-compliance.”

Consultants may also face disciplinary action such as being disallowed to participate in marketing activities for a period of time it said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vc2luZ2Fwb3JlL2pvYnMvdGhlLWZsaXAtc2lkZS1vZi10aGUtZ3JlYXQtcmVzaWduYXRpb24taGF2aW5nLXRvLXdvcmstbG9uZ2VyLWJlZm9yZS1yZXRpcmluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The flip side of the Great Resignation is having to work longer before retiring: Poll,"SINGAPORE - A wave of resignations during the Covid-19 pandemic as disgruntled employees quit unsatisfactory working conditions is expected to delay retirement for some who left their jobs in what has been dubbed ""The Great Resignation"" according to a poll by insurer Prudential Singapore.

Prudential polled 1000 Singapore residents who had resigned or intended to resign.

The survey was conducted in April with respondents aged between 25 and 50.

It found that one in five respondents caught in The Great Resignation wave expect to work for another six years on average resulting in them delaying retirement at 58 years to 64 instead.

This is because many people who undertake mid or late-career job switches end up taking pay cuts to start off in new roles.

But Mr Will Tan managing director of Principle Partners a specialist financial service executive search firm said job switches should not be considered only in dollars and cents and that such moves may well add a very fulfilling six more years of working life for some.

Mr Tan said some people resign after they re-evaluate what is more important to them.

One example is Mediacorp actress Felicia Chin who is leaving the broadcaster to join a non-profit organisation where she is likely to earn less but hopes to inspire others who are down and out.

Mr Tan added that he has also seen some who quit to take on a lower paying job that gives them more flexibility and work-life balance.

The Prudential survey found that one in two (52 per cent) who have resigned did so because they no longer felt engaged at work. Just over a third of the respondents also decided to make a switch to take care of their mental health or to leave a toxic work environment.

Principle Partners' Mr Tan said more executives are making a mid-career switch into a new industry.

""(There are) transferable skills no doubt but there's also a part of your experience that's not transferable. So you probably need to accept a lower pay"" he said.

Ms Jaya Dass managing director of recruitment firm Randstad Malaysia and Singapore is observing a similar trend of job seekers open to trying new work and pushing themselves beyond their comfort zone.

Ms Dass said many won't be lucky the first time round and that they will have to try and fail a few times before they find a job fit.",,,,,,,,,

The past few years have not been kind to the aerospace sector as they have suffered the brunt of Covid-19 lockdowns and travel bans with parked aircraft empty airports and closed production lines.

The pandemic has accelerated several pre-existing trends in aviation and aerospace with market participants identifying sustainable technologies industry consolidation and environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) as the three biggest themes punctuating the emerging new normal according to research from analysts Roland Berger.

Aerospace has always been a sector quite rightly that has been heavily reliant on stringent regulations to ensure quality and safety. Every aerospace project must apply the necessary standards to the engineering process. For software this is guided by DO-178B Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification which is a guideline dealing with the safety of safety-critical software used in certain airborne systems. For the hardware element RTCA DO-254/EUROCAE ED-80 Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware is a document guiding the development of airborne electronic hardware.

In addition to these requirements sustainability is becoming increasingly important and overshadows all the design engineering and manufacturing processes from the materials used in production through to the carbon footprint of the finished product and even the environmental performance of the aircraft itself. The design of these products now must be all-encompassing around not just the efficient designs that endure but they must be built and run sustainably. Being able to build sustainable products which is the same as many other industry verticals starts right at the beginning with requirements.

Closing the loop

Part of the process is the ability to prove that you are building the right product to meet the needs and this is where requirements-based design comes to the fore. The difficulty that aerospace manufacturers face is being able to close the loop between the myriad of requirements – including safety and sustainability – design and test to guarantee that these requirements are built into the process right at the beginning and then follow the lifecycle through the design and engineering process and verified through valid tests at the end of the process.

Codebeamer: a very capable cloud web user interface

Currently aerospace companies rely on CAD PLM and a multitude of software packages and specifying those requirements is usually co-ordinated through emails or spreadsheets.

This is now changing with Codebeamer a product PTC recently added to its portfolio when it acquired Intland. This solution is a very capable cloud web user interface focusing on requirements engineering risk management and test management linked and traced together. It is powerful around areas like agile so the latest contemporary approaches for design and integration with technologies like GitHub and Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines. It also delivers numerous out-of-the-box templates that offer processes ready for rigorous industry standards. This is a whole new way of working in the form of requirements-based design.

By defining the requirements and making them integral to design right at the start you can build tests within Codebeamer that are applied to ensure that the product's performance meets those requirements. To achieve this requires clearly defined requirements linked to designs in CAD PLM and ALM for software and then traceable links to the tests that prove the requirements are satisfied. The authorities can then audit that and check compliance.

This end-to-end visibility leans heavily on the concept of the digital thread that underpins much of PTC’s portfolio that creates a closed-loop between the digital and physical worlds transforming how products are engineered manufactured and serviced. Digital threads seek to create simple universal access to data. They follow a single set of related data as it weaves in and out of business processes and functions to enable continuity and accessibility.

This digital thread can be created for many different entities and processes. Most commonly a thread of a product follows the lifecycle from design inception through engineering and product lifecycle management (PLM) to manufacturing instructions supply chain management and through to service histories and customer events. This thread enables enterprises to anticipate and effectively communicate bi-directionally up and downstream of where the product is in its lifecycle ensuring all participants utilise the most current data and can react quickly to change or new insights. This digital thread is enabled by the orchestration and integration layer provided by ThingWorx a complete end-to-end technology platform designed for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). It delivers tools and technologies that empower businesses to rapidly develop and deploy powerful role-based applications and augmented reality (AR) experiences.

Aerospace is heavily reliant on stringent regulations to ensure quality and safety

A system of systems

One way to help companies improve their system engineering processes is model-based systems engineering (MBSE). MBSE uses models to define the system and this helps address complexity encourages reuse and helps manage product lines. As products grow more complex multiple engineering disciplines need to work together to design build and maintain them. Designing a system using models enables early visualisation and simulation improving stakeholder buy-in and customer satisfaction.

Model-based systems engineering enables collaborative innovative design and maintenance of complex systems. It helps organisations optimise the use of resources while complying with industry standards. This MBSE approach is facilitated through PTC’s Windchill Modeler.

This includes built-in linking and tracing between its native data management capabilities and systems engineering requirements management source code and testing. Core to this offering is Open Service Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) an OASIS industry standard to integrate its suite of products including Windchill and Codebeamer into a collaborative tool chain. This allows requirements to be closely linked to feel like a shared database even though Windchill and Codebeamer are separate tools.

For aerospace and defence organisations this visibility and control along the entire lifecycle of a product that delivers the ability to design engineer and manufacture a product based on requirements allows great control of the process and ensure that the finished product meets requirements whether they be safety sustainability of the more traditional parameters of cost weight and size.

Aoyuan is selling 49 percent of the issued share capital of Aoyuan Property Group Australia — a developer with six projects in the country — to a family trust of Adrian Liaw a director of certain project companies within APGA for a nominal consideration of two Australian dollars the developer said Thursday in a filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Under the terms of the deal Sydney-based Liaw — who also serves as president of Aoyuan’s international development division — will pay A$105 million ($72.5 million) to the parent group for the settlement of shareholder’s loans owed by APGA. Aoyuan will retain a 51 percent non-controlling stake in the Australian entity which will cease to be a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-listed firm.

Aoyuan expects to record a loss before related transaction costs from the disposal of A$245.9 million ($170 million) chairman Guo Zi Wen said in the filing. The proceeds of the transaction will go to general working capital and to meet the broader liquidity needs of the group which defaulted on $1.09 billion in offshore debt earlier this year.

Cash Emergency

APGA’s projects include The Lennox a 425-unit residential complex in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta that was completed in 2021 and Ashbourne Moss Vale a 124 hectare (306 acre) master-planned community in Sydney’s Southern Highlands.

Aoyuan said APGA delivered its projects as scheduled in the past two years but failed to achieve stable financial performance. The parent firm’s liquidity crunch is seen as an obstacle to ploughing additional funding into the Australian operation.

“The group’s urgency for cash warrants the realisation of its Australian assets” Aoyuan said.

Aoyuan announced in January that it would not make payments on four sets of offshore notes totalling $1.09 billion coming due that month and in June 2023 and June 2024. The group’s outstanding offshore debt also includes a $350 million bond maturing in 2027.

Last November Aoyuan agreed to sell off a redevelopment project in Hong Kong’s Mid-Levels to raise cash anticipating an estimated loss of HK$176.6 million ($22.5 million) on the disposal.

In late December Hong Kong hedge fund Nine Masts Capital joined Citibank in taking legal action to recoup more than $131 million owed to them by Aoyuan.

Exits From Oz

Aoyuan’s APGA disposal puts the developer in the company of several other Chinese property investors cutting back in Australia.

Bright Ruby a vehicle of billionaire steel tycoon Du Shuanghua is selling the five-star Hilton Sydney to Baring Private Equity Asia for A$530 million in Australia’s biggest-ever single-hotel deal Mingtiandi reported in May.

The Hilton Sydney sale was revealed just days after an account in the Australian indicated that Chinese developer AWH Investment Group was in final discussions to sell the One Circular Quay project on the Sydney harbourfront for close to A$1 billion.

In April the Sydney Morning Herald reported that China’s Poly Global had put up for sale multiple projects in Melbourne and Sydney including its A$300 million office project on La Trobe Street in the Victorian capital. That same month Guangzhou R&F walked away from a 10000-home project in Brisbane.",,,,,,,,,

Two years later there’s a successor device in the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3. The updates are relatively small which is fitting for Lenovo’s portable 11-inch Chrome OS tablet. Do they bring big improvements? Read on for my Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 review and the answer to that question.

[saswp-review id=”review”]

Chromebook Duet 3 hardware and specs

Lenovo sent me the base model of this device which I believe has an MSRP of $379. At some point during my Chromebook Duet 3 review period the price was temporarily discounted to $259; however at the moment Lenovo’s site doesn’t show availability at any price.

Regardless of that here’s what you get:

CPU Eight-core 2nd-gen Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c compute platform up to 2.55 GHz GPU Qualcomm Adreno 618 GPU Display 10.9-inch IPS 2000 x 1200 display glossy finish USI 2.0 stylus support

16:10 aspect ratio 400 nits brightness external monitor testing worked at 1440p at 60Hz and 1080p at 75Hz Memory 4 GB DDR4x-2133 MHz memory Storage 64 eMMC storage Connectivity 802.11ac (2×2) WiFi 5 Bluetooth 5.1 Input Non-backlit detachable keyboard multitouch trackpad

5 MP webcam and 8 MP rear camera

Dual-array microphones Ports 2 USB Type-C 3.2 ports

supporting PD 3.0 data and DisplayPort 1.4 Battery 29 WHr battery expected run-time up to 12 hours Weight Around 2 pounds with keyboard 1.14 pounds tablet only Software Chrome OS automatic updates through June 2029

Changes from the prior model include the chipset changing the display aspect ratio from 16:9 to 16:10 and a slightly higher screen resolution. The Duet 3 also gains a USB Type-C port so there’s now one on each side. And the keyboard uses Lenovo’s scalloped keycaps which improves the typing experience.

All in all this is a well-built lightweight Chrome OS tablet that looks and feels better than you’d expect at this price. The non-backlit keyboard attachment is included as is the removable kickstand.

Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Duet 3 side view

You don’t get a USI stylus in the box and unfortunately you’re not going to be using one if you already have a USI stylus. That’s because the Duet 3 supports USI 2.0 and those pens aren’t available yet. Lenovo has one in the works but no date for availability.

You’d think any USI stylus would work because the ”U” stands for universal. However due to the higher resolution of the Duet 3 that’s not the case. That could be a downer for those planning to take notes on this tablet. At least for now.

And another thing to watch out for: Local storage capacity. Lenovo will offer this device with either 64 or 128 GB of eMMC 5.1 storage but not with a microSD card. You get what you get when it comes to storage and that’s it.

Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 performance

If you read my review of the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5 a similar but larger Chrome OS tablet you’ll know what to expect when it comes to performance. That’s because internally the Duet 3 and 5 are practically identical. Both use the same second-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c chipset for example.

So my usage experience between the two is also practically identical. Here’s what I said about the Duet 5 and the same holds true with it’s smaller sibling:

It’s fine for browsing with a dozen or so tabs using web services and running a few Android apps. Put another way: I could get my work done on the Duet 5 with no problem; it just takes a little longer than I’m used to from time to time.

For an ARM-based Chrome OS tablet I find the performance more than acceptable. Especially for the cost. Yes you could spend a little more for a recent Intel-based Chromebook and you’d have a slightly faster experience. I wouldn’t call the speed difference between the Duet 3 and a Pentium-powered device to be massive though.

However this chipset upgrade from the original Chromebook Duet does

Here’s a set of benchmarks for perspective; note the figures for the original Duet in the first column compared with those for the Duet 3:

Test Lenovo Chromebook Duet

MediaTek P60T HP Chromebook X2 11

Snapdragon 7c Lenovo Duet 3

2nd-gen Snapdragon 7c Lenovo IdeaPad 5i

11th-gen Pentium Speedometer 1.0 48.59 90.93 93.5 249.8 Speedometer 2.0 29.52 51.4 51.3 144.0 JetStream 2 37.65 58.25 66.495 130.35 Basemark 3.0 210.02 276.69 283.24 1032.8 Octane 2.0 10518 22314 25096 47152 Higher numbers are better

The best way I can summarize overall performance is not glacially slow and not wickedly fast. Instead it’s ”just right” for casual browsing some Android apps (even light gaming apps) and daily online productivity.

What’s the Chrome OS experience like?

The Duet 3 can do everything any other Chromebook can do of course. You just need to keep in mind that a $300 Chromebook won’t quite compete on performance with a $500 Chromebook. Having said that I didn’t experience any show-stopping hiccups in Chrome OS. And that includes using virtual desks overview and split screen mode and the new productivity launcher.

I used this tablet full time for all of my work and while I’m used to a quicker overall experience on my personal Chromebook with Core i5 and 16 GB of RAM I didn’t get frustrated. I wrote blog posts managed email streamed online video content and ran the occasional Android app. I even enabled Linux and got some coding done in Visual Studio Code (an ARM version debuted last year) although my programming tasks don’t include writing or building massive applications.

Visual Studio Code on the Duet 3

The only real challenge I ran into was the limited amount of memory: As I opened and closed tabs throughout my day I’d see some background tabs eventually start reloading. So I’d opt for the upcoming Duet 3 model with 8 GB of memory to resolve this.

If you’re going to use the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 as a primary device I would recommend pairing it with an external monitor. I tested this with my 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor and had no issues using it as a second display.

Unlike the original Chromebook Duet this new model can easily push a 1080p signal at 75fps on my monitor. I added a mechanical USB keyboard and wireless mouse for this setup and enjoyed the experience.

While I wasn’t impressed by the audio and video capabilities of the Duet 3 they’re passable. Images from the webcam on Google Meet calls weren’t the sharpest for example. And the pair of one watt speakers are average at best. However when you’re looking at a device that’s $300 or less this is to be expected. Boosting these components adds costs and I’m sure Lenovo had a price point in mind for this tablet.

And although the trackpad is small it works quite well. So too does the keyboard which is slightly larger than what the original Duet offered. Yes it can take time to get used to the size of certain modifier keys. That’s a compromise that has to be made when there’s only so much space to work with. I found the typing experience to be quite good.

Lenovo’s claim of 12 hour battery life is a bit optimistic. Then again most battery life claims are. However I routinely ran the device for no less than 9 hours on most days and sometimes even got a full 10 hours of use. With quick charging capabilities I don’t think battery life will be an issue for most buyers.

Should you buy the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3?

At this price the Duet 3 is a solid value. However the purchase decision all depends on how you plan to use your Chromebook. If you’re looking for above average performance or a powerful primary device you might want to look elsewhere.

While I said I could (and did) use the Duet 3 as a full-time Chromebook I wouldn’t purchase it for that purpose. I prefer a faster experience particularly when using Linux on Chromebooks and I’m willing to pay more for that.

Would I drop $300 or so for this as a secondary around the house Chromebook though? Absolutely! The bright high resolution display is nice to look at while the footprint and weight of the Duet 3 is small and low. I think I used this tablet in every room of my house (except the bathrooms!) with ease.

I’d say if you’re in the market for an entry level Chromebook and your tasks or workflow complements that type of device the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 is a good choice. It’s not nearly as limiting as the original model which many people raved about; for good reason. This is great Chrome OS on the go device that can also work reasonably well in a stationary or docked environment as needed.

Just like the original I think Lenovo has created a compelling highly portable Chrome OS tablet at a reasonably low cost. If that’s what you’re looking for you’ll find it here. Keep in mind if you want a larger display and keyboard along with better color reproduction the Lenovo Duet Chromebook 5 is a good option. Heck you can get this larger device with 8 GB of memory and 128 GB of storage for $379 today at a Best Buy.

The Lenovo Duet 5 performs solidly with a Snapdragon 7c Gen 2

I still think that device is a better laptop than tablet but either way the visual experience is outstanding.

Frankly Lenovo owns the Chrome OS tablet market in either the 11-inch or 13.3-inch size at this point. You really can’t go wrong with either choice depending on which screen size you prefer.

Last week Joonas from fpv.wtf released some info on Twitter on what we believe is the origins of the DJI digital FPV system chipset known as the P1 and what Waslksnail may be using in the Avatar system and today I wanted to expand on that.

There has been a massive amount of conjecture and speculation over the Avatar system and if it is actually DJI based on DJI chipset or just something similar. To understand this more we have to look at DJI first and the chipsets they have used over the years from Leadcore Artosyn and others. Leadcore To start we first have to understand who and what Leadcore is the company was a fabless chipset design house that was a subsidiary of Datang Telecom Technology Co. Ltd who in themselves was a subsidiary of the partly Chinese state-owned “China Academy of Telecommunications Technology”.

Leadcore’s main business was the development of application processors and IP for mobile devices. In 2014 they were the sixth-largest supplier of smartphone SOC in China. Its LC1860 chipset was widely used in devices across China. Leadcore appears to have somewhat vanished in 2018 when its parent company Datang Telecom Technology was apparently having financial difficulties and faced being delisted from the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

However their chipsets are still used today in many drones from Autel and their IP lives on in other chipsets. Artosyn Shanghai Kuxin Microelectronics Co.Ltd known in China as Kuxin with the Artosyn brand is a Chinese fabless chip design house specialising on wireless video processing and AI chipsets. So back to DJI.

The best place to start is with the release of the Inspire 1 (I1) where DJI introduces Lightbridge. A new Wimax-based wireless system that replaced the basic WiFi-based systems they were using before and offered HD long range video and RC control link. It was originally driven by an Altera Cyclone V FPGA in the I1 and then Phantom 3 Advanced and Pro then later in the Phantom 4. In later variants of these models such as the B C remotes DJI replaced the FPGA with a pair of SDR chips from Artosyn the AR8001 DSP and AR8003 RF transceiver.

The overall system was the same simply the chipset it was running on changed. A little later with the release of the Inspire 2 DJI started using the Leadcore LC1860 chipset alongside the Artosyn AR8001 with an AD transceiver. In the Phantom 4 Pro DJI again was using Lightbridge 2 however this time the Artosyn AR8001 was gone and replaced with a very similar-looking chipset but with a DJI logo on it. It’s believed this was still the AR8001 or at least a variant and shows DJI was starting to ‘tinker’ with getting silicon with its own name or specific specs.

When DJI released the Mavic Pro it came with a new wireless system called Ocusync. Overall very similar to Lightbrige but the big technical change in this was that it was said to be an SDR. Whilst Lightbridge was also an SDR with the Artosyn chipsets under the hood changes were that the Artosyn chipsets were gone and the Leadcore LC1860C coupled with the IE1000 front end transceiver from Imagination took over the full job of the radio system.

At this point it’s fair to summarize that DJI had been working on using the built-in SDR LTE modems and the ARM cores for driving the wireless system for some time on the Leadcore chipset alongside and felt it was now in a position to transition to that fully. DJI continued to use the LC1860C Leadcore chipsets as the SDR in all Ocusync and Ocusync 2 models from that point including in the Ocusync Air FPV system the DJI White Goggles and Goggles RE. O2 that was released with the Mavic 2 was very much a code improvement over Ocusync in most respects and even offered some compatibility back and forth.

Quietly in the life span of the Mavic 2 DJI released a B remote with the enterprise edition that in itself was nothing particularly unusual as we have seen in the past however there was a rather large hidden change and that was that DJI replaced the Leadcore LC1860C with a new and at the time unknown chipset.

This new IC seen in FCC filings has a Leadcore logo among others but looked different to everything before however later we now know it looks a lot like what was to come next. This brings us somewhat up-to the present day and the DJI Digital FPV System.

With the release of this DJI introduced the P1 chipset. This new SOC was believed to be a custom DJI ASIC that allowed them to develop a lower latency system than we had seen from anyone before. As time has gone on and with a massive amount of work from the likes of tmbinc bri3d and joonas we now know that the P1 is really just a customized and dedicated Leadcore IP based chipset with tweaks to the LTE baseband that go beyond just using the modems like in Ocusync 2.

It’s nothing specifically magical it’s just more customized for this use case with the “bits” not needed for tablets and smartphones removed and deeper changes to the LTE baseband. We know it still has two big Cortex-A7 cores some small ones Ceva DSP’s and a few other bits.

They are basically using the same CPU core + DSP setup as the Leadcore chipset and it’s likely running custom software for their LTE-based OcuSync and this is what’s making the difference. The first A7 core on the P1 runs Linux while the second runs the baseband RTOS in combination with dedicated DSPs. All later drone models from DJI including the M200 V2 M300 Mavic Air 2 Air 2S Mini 2 and Mavic 3 all use the P1 chipset with their remotes using either the P1 or its smaller brother the S1. The P1 has become DJI’s core chipset for all their Ocusync systems now.

Leadcore Chipset In Autel and Herelink & Artosyn In Other Manufacturers Alongside DJI it has been found that Autel has also been using the Leadcore chipsets in their drone wireless systems even the Herelink Pinecone S1 SOC was co-developed by Leadcore and Xiaomi.

While others such as Autel use Leadcore Zero Robotics and Hollyhand use Artosyn chipsets with similar functionally. It’s worth noting though that DJI has been largely a step ahead of everyone else and there is clear history and a relationship between DJI Artosyn and Leadcore that seems to have given DJI the edge over everyone else. So what does this all mean?

From a high level you can look at this as the Chinese state government tasked parts of its wireless industry to create rival chipsets to the likes of Qualcomm for the domestic smartphone market. This has allowed Chinese manufacturers like DJI to gain much deeper access to the LTE baseband modems used than we have seen in the US and EU and this has allowed them to develop the system we see today.

The question of who actually did the work is not known but it’s likely with the clear relationship between all the companies there has been a few hands in it to develop low latency wireless systems that leave the competition standing. Today we see chipsets from Artosyn such as the older AR8020 that appear to offer a lot of what DJI has in the P1 and the newer AR8211 has more functionality with H265 and 4K30 capabilities.

These are what you could call off-the-shelf silicon however getting access to these is far more complicated than ordering from Mouser or Digichip. They are very much kept out of the public’s hands. It’s very interesting how these Artosyn chipsets have developed in recent years especially since Leadcore as a company seems to have publicly vanished it’s very likely that there is Leadcore DNA and IP in there. Did DJI rattle the US government?

A final and interesting point on DJI on this subject is around the rumours that were circling for some time that the release of the DJI FPV system coincides with the US commerce ban and there was talk that DJI was using a US-based chipset and the US GOV was not happy with what they had done and banned them. We now know that is largely incorrect however I will add that we have not seen anything like what DJI has done with the LTE baseband modems in the West and while it may not be a US chipset the original LTE core IP origins have links to Qualcomm and/or Ceva and it’s not at all beyond belief that what they have done rattled some cages in the US and EU where this kind of “tinkering” is largely reserved for the military.

So what about Walksnail and Fatshark Dominator HD. While we don’t know for sure the new Artosyn chipsets certainly fit the bill the AR8211 has more functionality than the DJI P1 with H265 and 4K30 capabilities. I would not be shocked to see this or a variant of it in this system. We know Artosyn is working with partners on FPV as they confirmed this to Joonas when he contacted them.

In the end the simple reality is DJI is simply doing what they have always done and developed their system based on others’ tech and IP that’s what DJI is best at. They may be doing some custom implementation in the modem but it’s nothing magical. It looks like Artosyn is doing the same and Avatar is using that. If this is all the case it’s not a copy or clone it’s simply just a similar implementation based on the same underlying technology.

Final Notes. I want to say a massive thank you to

Joonas first of all for the help info and support helping put this together furthermore a huge amount of thanks to tmbinc and bri3d for all the amazing work they have done helping us unravel this all.

The exterior of the gaming phone is defined by its striking back and an RGB gaming LED. This is particularly the case for the yellow color variant. Thanks to the combination of a surface made of protective glass and a metal frame the Poco F4 feels premium in the hand. Additionally there are gaming-typical retractable pop-up triggers. A mechanical slider allows users to quickly switch to the gaming mode.

Although the Gorilla Glass Victus on the front slightly warps around the edges the screen does not curve. While the 6.67-inch OLED display has fairly slim bezels on the sides the ""chin"" bezel of the gaming smartphone is not quite as subtle resulting in a screen-to-body ratio of a solid 86 %.

There are a ton of gaming phones out there but ROG Phones have built their own legacy and brand in the Indian market. The Asus ROG Phone 5s carries on with that legacy. However after using it for a few months now I have figured out some of the strong points as well as weak points of the device. Bear with me to understand how this device actually is.









Asus ROG Phone 5s Review: Body and Design

So there’s this thing about the smartphones from the Asus ROG series. They don’t really look good from afar but they have a certain feel to them when you notice the craftsmanship from close. The ROG Phone 5s doesn’t have a unique design to be honest. We have seen the same with the ROG Phone 5.

However for people who are not aware of the design language of the Asus ROG Phone 5s there are a few cool things and a few not-so-cool things. Let’s go over the cool ones first.

On the right side of the device there are two Air Triggers. These are meant to help users with gaming. We will get into what Air Triggers are later. At the back you have got Aura Atmosphere lighting. In simple words it is lighting on the back which is cool but doesn’t really serve a big purpose. But it is good enough to differentiate the ROG Phone 5s as a gaming phone from other regular high-end flagships in the same price range.

You have got two Type-C ports on the device. One is at the bottom for when you are charging the device in a regular way. The second one is mounted on the side so that users can play games comfortably in the landscape mode and also keep charging the device without the interference of a charging cable.

The camera bump is the usual and something that all the ROG Phone users have gotten used to watching. Hopefully with the ROG Phone 6 Asus will change that because it is getting boring. The power button is coated with sort of a reddish colour metal on the sides.

You will see the SIM card holder on the left of the device which can also be spotted very easily as it is completely red in colour. The power button and the volume rockers are on the right side in between the Air Triggers. This device also comes with a 3.5mm audio jack at the bottom.

At the front we have got a big display which we will talk about when we come to the display segment of our review. The device is naturally quite big and can’t be used by a single hand by a majority of the population.

I guess in terms of design Asus still has a long way to go to make its ROG Phones look beautiful. Yes they do stand out from the rest of the devices in the market but are they elegant smartphones as well? I really can’t say that and it is a big ‘uncool’ thing about the device. Anyway let’s move on to the display.

Asus ROG Phone 5s Display and Sound

Asus ROG Phone 5s comes with a 6.78-inch Samsung AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution and 144Hz refresh rate support. It is covered with the Gorilla Glass Victus and doesn’t have a punch-hole cutout or a notch at the top. There is a complete screen and the front camera sensor is at the top on the bezel. This came at a cost though. To keep the screen big and also have the front camera sensor at the top outside the screen area the device had to be made bigger.

There’s a chin at the bottom which is quite thick as per the standards of a flagship today. But whom am I kidding? The ROG Phone 5s isn’t built to be beautiful but to be functional for gamers. That is what the ROG Phone 5s reflects in its overall design and display. It might be a beautiful device for others but for me I don’t find any particular elegance about it.

Regardless the display experience is really awesome and one of the best I have ever had. This has a reason behind it. First of all since it is a gamer’s smartphone its display is geared to be high performance. The touch is very responsive and the fact that it supports 144Hz refresh rate is phenomenal.

You can play content in the highest quality on the screen of the device and enjoy a very good viewing experience. But the display is not the lone factor in determining whether a device can deliver a great content viewing or gaming experience. There are also speakers and sound output involved.

When it comes to sound with the ROG Phone 5s you are not going to be disappointed. No one on the planet can be disappointed with the kind of sound that the ROG Phone 5s can deliver. At its max levels it is just so loud that you won’t even be able to comprehend whether it’s actually a smartphone playing the sound or whether it’s a damn external audio speaker!

In the display quality and sound output the ROG Phone 5s is arguably one of the best devices in the global market. Let’s talk about what the device can actually do when it comes to performance in other areas.

Asus ROG Phone 5s Performance and Battery Review

The Asus ROG Phone 5s comes powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888+ SoC. It is the enhanced version of the 2021 flagship SoC from Qualcomm. You can get the ROG Phone 5s with up to 18GB RAM (Pro variant) which is just bollocks as I don’t think anyone really needs that. Further the device comes with UFS 3.1 internal storage up to 512GB which is decent.

When I booted the device around three months back it ran on Android 11 out of the box. To my disappointment the ROG Phone 5s still hasn’t received the Android 12 update (at least on my unit). Regardless I am not disappointed by the UI or the OS; both are great. The device is ultra-smooth to operate. Note that I have been using the 8GB+128GB variant and still haven’t found any issues with gaming or multi-tasking.

The Asus ROG Phone 5s is a dark horse when it comes to overall performance. The device is geared with so many tools that for a person who is using the Asus ROG Phone for the first time he/she will be really amazed or overwhelmed to see so many things for enhancing the performance of the smartphone for gaming.

There’s Game Genie which Asus ROG Phone fans really love. It allows you to take control over the kind of gaming experience you want. Through Game Genie you can also activate/deactivate Air Triggers while inside the game.

However Game Genie can only be accessed while playing a game. To make other changes to the kind of setting your device is running on for games you have to go to Armoury Crate. It is an app that you will find is pre-installed and allows you to do multiple things such as interact with other gamers around the world and more.

There’s an ‘X-Mode’ that users can activate whenever they want the device to go under the highest performance settings for gaming. The Aura Lightning can be manually controlled as per the user’s wish. But it is ideal to keep it off most of the time because it will suck up a lot of battery. In terms of performance there’s never a dull experience with the ROG Phone 5s. However there’s one thing that has bugged me a lot about the device. It is that its fingerprint scanner is somehow not the best at reading my fingerprint. For a device such as ROG Phone 5s I certainly expected more.

Being a gaming device the ROG Phone 5s needs to have a good battery performance. First of all it packs a 6000mAh battery with support for standard 30W fast-charging. Oh how I wish that it could have supported faster charging. Anyhow the device does give a pretty good battery backup. But it can heat up pretty good. Donning the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888+ the device is more apt to be kept under cool conditions. Over here in India when I took the device to the porch outside which doesn’t have AC it heated up to the level where I no longer wanted to keep it in my pocket or my hands.

Even while charging ensure you are leaving the device in a cool room as it can heat up pretty good. Note that Asus does offer a fan as an accessory for heavy gamers which can keep the device cool most of the time. Also it is expected that a device made for gaming will overheat so there’s nothing too bad or surprising about it.

Let’s talk about the Air Triggers 5 integrated into the device for a second. It is a very distinguishable feature/specification of the device and one I think that makes a lot of difference. If you are a gamer and want a more convenient gaming experience the ROG Phone 5s literally comes with console-like buttons. You don’t need to press anything here; just touch the part of the body where the Air Triggers are present.

It will change the whole experience for you when you are playing games such as PUBG Mobile Battlegrounds Mobile India Call of Duty and more. These Air Triggers can act as buttons on your screen. Mind that they are very effective and work super well giving real-time commands. It is something that you will have to experience for yourself as it is a technology that you won’t find on your usual smartphone.

On that note let’s see how is the camera of the device.

Asus ROG Phone 5s Camera Review

I don’t have a lot to say about the camera of the Asus ROG Phone 5s. In its full capacity I would say it is okay. But I seriously expected more. So what that it is a gaming phone; if you are taking Rs 50000 and upwards from me I would seriously expect a great camera experience. However as I said it’s not really bad. But it isn’t great either. The device comes with a primary Sony IMX686 64MP sensor paired with a 13MP ultra-wide-angle sensor and a 5MP sensor at the rear. On the front you will get a 24MP sensor at the front for selfies and videos.

Anyway attached below are the camera samples for your reference.

Asus ROG Phone 5s Review: Price and Conclusion

The Asus ROG Phone 5s is one of the most powerful devices I have had an experience with. There are a lot of unique things and features about this device that help it stand out in the market. It is a 5G supportive device and can be a good option for gamers once 5G is launched widely in the country (that’s still a long way to go).

You can expect a great display and sound experience along with a powerful performance for multitasking and heavy gaming. But you can’t really expect a flagship-like camera experience or a very beautiful and elegant design/body from this gaming phone.

The Asus ROG Phone 5s is available in two variants in India. The base variant comes with 8GB+128GB for Rs 49999 and the superior variant comes with 12GB+256GB for Rs 57999. As mentioned above there’s also a Pro variant with 18GB+256GB for Rs 79999.

If you are considering buying a gaming phone the ROG Phone 5s can be one of the top choices today."

“This year our teams around the world delivered strong results that exceeded our expectations with growth across every brand channel category and region — demonstrating their agility and strength amid an environment that remained challenging” said executive chairman and chief creative officer Ralph Lauren and chief executive officer Patrice Louvet in a joint letter to shareholders filed with regulatory authorities.

Sales bounced back from the worst of the pandemic increasing 41 percent to $6.2 billion for the year ended April 2.

For his efforts Lauren saw his compensation rise 45.6 percent to $24.9 million. That included $12 million in incentive pay and a salary of $1.8 million. His package also included stock awards that were valued at $11 million although the full value of share-based compensation will ultimately rely on the company’s Wall Street performance.

Louvet’s package increased 53.8 percent to $18.6 million including $7.9 million in incentive pay.

The five executives named in the fashion company’s proxy statement logged total compensation of $68.9 million — an increase of 48.1 percent from a year ago.

That top tier included Howard Smith who was chief commercial officer but resigned at the end of the year after an investigation found he had “violated the company’s code of business conduct and ethics and other policies.”

The nature of the exact violations was never revealed beyond the vague reassurance from the firm that they were “unrelated to the company’s financial reporting and business performance.”

A source told WWD when the departure was revealed that the violations were not related to either sex or money but instead reflected multiple incidents of “misjudgment.”

Still Smith a 19-year veteran of the company was allowed to walk away with a significant pay package.

I wish I did it on purpose USF Fam... here's 150+ photos from USF's nail biter loss to the Oviedo State Citronauts back in November 2020.

Sooooo…. I realized i never posted this photo album from SLIME TIME against the Oviedo State Community College Citronauts so why not share now right? Enjoy USF Fam! Plenty on deck from us here at SoFloBulls.com for the 2022 season. #ComebackSZN

Here’s a refresher on what went down in Tampa in the 2020 edition of the #WarOnI4 Rivalry:

The South Florida Bulls (1-8 0-7) took the field for the last time this season. Facing off against the in-state rival UCF Knights (6-3 6-2) in what is known as the War On I4 the Bulls were defeated by a score of 46-58. Despite the disappointing outcome of the game the score does not quite tell the story of the entire matchup.

Right out of the gate on the Bulls’ first drive of the game the offense looked exciting. Not only was the offense exciting to watch but it looked as if the players were having genuine fun a feature covered up in previous losses. Despite not scoring on the opening drive the offense led by Quarterback Jordan McCloud had given all USF fans hope.

The Bulls’ second possession is where things started to get even more interesting ending in a 23-yard touchdown strike from Jordan McCloud to DeVontres Odoms-Dukes.

Now leading UCF by a score of 7-0 it was easy to tell that this game was going to be different. Different in a way that only true diehard USF Bulls fans could describe. But what was the difference maker? Was it the Bulls’ new “Slime” uniforms or the fact that this game was being broadcasted on ESPN? Whatever it was South Florida was playing its best football of the season (even better than the game they won against The Citadel 27-6). The Bulls were putting all of their blood sweat and tears into this game.

I’ll never forget when Jordan McCloud MOPPED UP a UCF defender on the goal line in the third quarter:

The Fourth Quarter was nothing short of electric. Star linebacker Dwayne Boyles picked off Dillon Gabriel igniting a deafening roar from the crowd at Raymond James Stadium. The play left USF fans on their feet screaming and high-fiving each other.

For processors available on the new Lenovo Legion Y9000K also known as the Legion 7 16IAX7 the system will use the Intel i7-12800HX or i9-12900HX which are desktop-grade processors that utilize 16 cores across 24 threads. The Intel i7-12800HX has a boost clock of 4.8 GHz while the i9-12900HX will boost a clock of 5 GHz. While the i9-12900HX has been used for gaming laptops the Intel i7-12800HX will show for the first time in a laptop configuration with the new Lenovo product.

Graphics cards available for configuration on the new Lenovo Legion Y9000K laptop are both NVIDIA GPUs. The two available are from the company's widely popular RTX 30 series — either the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti or the RTX 3080 Ti. The motherboard is the HM670 which allows for an optional 32GB DDR5-4800 memory for the laptops. The Savior Y9000K will support overclocking up to DDR5-5400 memory with the capability of two PCIe 4.0 SSD drives. Battery capacity offers 99Wh with a 300W AC adapter.

With GPU prices declining quickly 3DCenter came up with an idea to compare official suggested retail prices to the graphics card’s actual performance.

This is an insight of how much should each card cost based on its performance alone. The price to performance value is calculated by 3DCenter’s 4K index meticulously collected data based on a long list of reviews.

As graphics cards become cheaper and available through multiple channels one can now choose between a number of different custom models or even consider its competition from other brands. This is especially true for high-end models which were among the first cards to see a significant drop in price over the last few weeks.

It is also no secret that many cards released mainly in 2021 were overpriced from the beginning. Both AMD and NVIDIA chose heavily inflated MSRPs because those cards would never sell at a lower price anyway. However it is about time both companies realize that their prices are no longer good in relation to the actual performance.

According to 3DCenter’s calculations who have chosen RTX 3070 as the reference point most of NVIDIA’s high-end models are overpriced and should cost a lot less. However mid-range and low-end models from the NVIDIA lineup could be considered well priced especially the RTX 3060 Ti model which offers better performance than its costs. That’s also the reason why many board partners had no 3060 Ti in stock for many months it was simply too powerful for its price and board partners could easily sell costlier SKUs in its place.

In fact the situation on the GPU market has changed so much that NVIDIA is supposedly no longer shipping its RTX 3080 12GB model to board partners. The reason stated by leaker MEGAsizeGPU is its price in comparison to RTX 3080 Ti. NVIDIA has never publicly confirmed 3080 12GB MSRP though.

nope，only 3080 12G is been stop produced. After the dramatic price drop of 3080Ti 3080 12G now has the same price as 3080Ti and that’s why Nvidia decides to stop sending 3080 12G chips to the AIC. — MEGAsizeGPU (@Zed__Wang) June 26 2022

The RTX 3090 series are among the worst priced cards in whole comparison. Both cards retail above 1000 USD while their actual prices should be below that value. However anything under RTX 3080 Ti is actually within 10% of the ‘Fair Price’ index which in most cases means small overpricing or perfect (100%) balance between MSRP and card’s performance (but remember this in reference to RTX 3070).

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 MSRP vs “Fair Price” 3DCenter.org MSRP 4K Performance Index Perf./List Fair price GeForce RTX 3090 Ti $1999 408% 41% $814 GeForce RTX 3090 $1499 376% 50% $750 GeForce RTX 3080 Ti $1199 366% 61% $731 GeForce RTX 3080 12GB ? ~344% – $687 GeForce RTX 3080 10GB $699 330% 94% $659 GeForce RTX 3070 Ti $599 271% 90% $541 GeForce RTX 3070 $499 250% 100% $499 GeForce RTX 3060 Ti $399 217% 109% $433 GeForce RTX 3060 $329 165% 100% $329 GeForce RTX 3050 $249 ~114% 91% $228 Performance/price normalized to the GeForce RTX 3070 derived from the “fair list prices”

For AMD Radeon RX 6000 series the RX 6800 and 6800 non-XT appear to be the best priced model considering their performance. The inflated MSRP prices for RDNA2 are not really that far from the ‘Fair Price’ index though especially the middle of the stack. This isn’t the case for enthusiast and low-end models. The RX 6950XT should cost 735USD based on this analysis while the RX 6400 should drop to the 107 USD level.

One should remember that performance is not always the only thing that should be considered. This is especially true for flagship cards which come with highly sophisticated board designs massive cooling solutions or other features. That surely adds a cost for board partners that cannot be calculated by framerate alone.

One thing is certain the GPU price cut should be expected now more than ever. Sadly neither AMD nor NVIDIA are officially preparing one however boards partners are eagerly awaiting such announcements soon. The time is ticking though as the large stock of RTX 30/RX6000 cards is no longer a surprise to anyone retailers will now only have 3 months to sell the majority of current-gen cards before gamers’ attention shifts to the next generation.

Mammotion has demonstrated the LUBA and KUMAR robot lawn mowers at spoga+gafa 2022 in Cologne. This was the company's first public event since the launch of its LUBA Kickstarter campaign which already has over 2000 backers.

The LUBA is the brand's first wireless robotic lawn mower retailing for US$2499. The device has an all-wheel drive and can cover areas up to 5000 m² (~53820 ft²) between charges. Ultrasonic radar gives the robot a 220° field of view for accurate obstacle avoidance.

The KUMAR is a version of the robot lawn mower geared towards commercial use designed to mow large lawns parks or river embankments. The device is fitted with a GPS-RTK satellite positioning system and you can set the virtual boundary in the accompanying smartphone app. Four ultrasonic radars enable the robot to detect and avoid fallen branches pets and pedestrians.

The robot can mow up to 12000 m² (~129167 ft²) between charges thanks to two 24 Ah batteries and Mammotion claims that the device is seven times cheaper to run than a regular fuel mower. The company is expected to sell both robot lawn mowers via Amazon. However a general sale date has not been given.

Per CNN the burger chain sold 850 restaurants — which employs 62k people — to the local franchisee a Siberian oil tycoon (McDonald’s says it’ll take a $1.4B charge against its earnings for the deal).

The English translation of the company’s new name is straight to the point: “Tasty and That’s It” (the new logo is still in the shape of an “M” and apparently is supposed to look like a burger and two fries).

McDonald’s arrival in Moscow on January 31st 1990 was one of the most iconic moments in fast-food history. It happened near the end of the Cold War and signified an opening of Russia to the West (the restaurant had 30k+ visited on the first day).

The Moscow location has two general lessons for the McDonald’s business:

Control of franchisees: When McDonald’s entered Russia the Communist country did not have “private businesses to supply the 300 or so distinct ingredients needed by a McDonald’s outlet” per NYT. So McDonald’s built a $50m factory outside of Moscow (appropriately called The McComplex) to supply the buns lettuce frozen fries beef etc. McDonald’s wouldn’t completely outsource its Russia supply chain until 2010 (the existence of this in-country supply chain is actually one reason that the current franchisee was able to easily take over the brand).

Real estate deals: In the late 1980s Russia was so keen to get McDonald’s into the country that it agreed to a wild deal. It took 14 years to negotiate but McDonald’s was able to secure the first Moscow location for 1 ruble per square meter a year. Here’s the kicker: the lease was for 49 years! And — over the years — attempts to renegotiate it repeatedly failed.

McDonald’s Russia business was not lucrative in the early years as the country was quite poor. While prices for a meal were 50% less that in the United States it still amounted to a half day’s wage.

The deal was still worth it for McDonald’s. Why? Because of the real estate perks. In 1993 McDonald’s opened a $15m downtown office (appropriately called McDonald’s Tower) that it co-owned with the Moscow City Council.

The fast food chain leased the space to other Western corporations (Coca-Cola Amex Toyota) trying to break into the Russian market.

The cliche “McDonald’s is a real estate company” was quite literal in the early Moscow days.

Today McDonald’s real estate holding is worth $42B and 36% of its $23B in revenue is from franchisees paying rents.

Let’s break down the business.

There are currently 40k+ McDonald’s restaurants in 110+ countries (based on crude estimates I’ve eaten at 15876 of them).

Among these stores McDonald’s owns:

55% of LAND under the locations (+ long-term leases for the rest)

80% of buildings

McDonald’s $42B real estate holdings are ~80% of total assets and can be thought of like apartment buildings that collect rent.

The McDonald’s story is most associated with Ray Croc who had a contentious relationship with the founding McDonald’s brothers (TLDR: Croc partnered with them on the chain but ended up booting them out in a sketchy manner).

However it was Harry J. Sonneborn — McDonald’s President from 1955-1967 — who created the lucrative real estate model for the fast food chain.

Croc’s initial model extracted money from franchisees by:

Charging an initial franchise fee

Escalating royalty payments

Selling them marked-up supplies

Unhappy franchisees could balk at the demands. So Sonneborn pitched a way for more control: become a landlord.

To build the real estate business Croc and Sonneborn — played by Michael Keaton and BJ Novak in the pretty damn good 2016 biopic The Founder — launched McDonald’s Franchise Realty Corp in 1956.

Soon they started buying real estate and leasing it to franchisees at a 40% markup.

Here was the control catch: if franchisees ignored McDonald’s guidance they were breaking the lease and could be evicted.

This is how Sonneborn explained the arrangement to Wall Street investors:

“We are not…in the food business. We are in the real estate business. The only reason we sell $0.15 burgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue from which our tenants can pay us rent.”

While Kroc disliked Sonneborn’s blunt framing the model remains true to this day.

In 2021 McDonald’s made $13.1B in revenue from franchisees. Rent was 64% ($8.4B) and Royalties was 36% ($4.6B) of that figure.

At the individual level 8-15% of franchisee sales go to rent.

Overall McDonald’s made $23B in 2021 split between:

Franchisee-run stores (57% of sales)

Company-run stores (43% of sales)

Add it all up and rent accounts for 35% of McDonald’s TOTAL revenue.

The Franchise model is much more profitable for McDonald’s with 82% operating margins (vs. 18% for company-owned stores which the chain has to run itself).

Unsurprisingly McDonald’s weights its stores towards high-margin franchisees which account for 93% of its 40k+ locations.

McDonald’s uses company-owned locations to test new ideas/products before rolling them out to franchisees which typically sign 20-year lease agreements.

To identify good real estate locations McDonald’s uses traffic analysis walking patterns and census data.

An ideal location has:

50k+ sqft

Corner or corner wrap with signage on two major streets.

Signalized intersection

Build height of 23ft

Parking lot potential

Here is the model’s secret sauce: McDonald’s typically finances the property at a fixed rate but — because royalties are 4% of sales (+ a fee for ads) — its take from franchisees are variable.

As sales and prices rise (*cough* inflation *cough*) McDonald’s captures sales upside while its largest financial outlay is fixed.

In the early-2010s investors were clamouring for McDonald’s to spin off its real estate biz into a REIT (real estate investment trust).

In 2015 McDonald’s decided against the REIT in part because the deal was too complicated (including changes to the tax code that made such a spin-off less advantageous).



But the real reason is probably that Sonnebon’s model is just too good of a business…as elegantly explained by this Wall Street Bets post:

A viral fast food thread: On a related note here’s a former Wendy’s pricing manager breaks (what a baller job) breaking down the economics of a single fast food store. Some hi-lights from the Twitter thread:

30/30/30 rule : Successful stores aim for a cost breakdown of 30% wages / 30% site costs (utilities rent maintenance) / 30% food costs. The remaining 10% is for profits and franchise fees.

: Successful stores aim for a cost breakdown of 30% wages / 30% site costs (utilities rent maintenance) / 30% food costs. The remaining 10% is for profits and franchise fees. The most profitable items: …are drinks and fries. Sandwiches have the most food cost and you’d quickly go out of business only selling those.

…are drinks and fries. Sandwiches have the most food cost and you’d quickly go out of business only selling those. Ground beef: Major fast-food chains do not get ground beef at a lower cost than regular shoppers (even with high volumes). Why? Ground beef is usually a loss-leader for supermarkets so prices are already low across the board.

Advertising hacks: A wild YouTube video that shows how fast-food chains make their products look “good” for TV. Example: motor oil is drizzled on top of pancakes instead of syrup (Why? the pancakes don’t absorb the syrup and look fluffier).

Dr. Seuss: I’ve read my son Dr. Seuss books for years. For some reason the “That Sam I Am” character from Green Eggs & Ham puts my kid into stitches. Anyways I recently discovered the wild origin story behind the book (and it’s confirmed by Snopes):

Green Eggs and Ham was born out of a $50 wager between Dr. Seuss and his publisher Bennett Cerf who bet he couldn’t write an articulate entertaining book using only fifty different words. The result was a 62-page volume composed of 49 monosyllabic words and a fiftieth three-syllable word “anywhere.”

THE POWER OF CONSTRAINTS! (Side note: While Googling this story I came by some highly inappropriate — but hilarious — fake Dr. Seuss book covers)

In addition to causing untold physical violence the ongoing conflict has had grievous impacts on mental health in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

When Congolese Asiya Kashindi was a teenager she suffered a violent sexual assault and witnessed her father’s murder in one night Noella Nyirabihogo reported. Though Kashindi experienced this attack in 2005 she still struggles with severe depression and chronic migraines as a result of her trauma. Yet Kashindi has never sought treatment from a mental health care professional. For those living in the DRC Kashindi’s story of trauma and a lack of mental health treatment represents a common experience.

Conflict and Mental Health in the Democratic Republic of Congo

The DRC has been embroiled in violent conflict since the 1990s when the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda sparked the First Congo War. Shortly after in 1998 continued tensions led to the outbreak of the Second Congo War which officially ended in 2003 and caused millions of deaths. Following the wars militant groups remained common throughout the country and continue to perpetrate violence in the DRC to this day.

As a result of these violent conflicts many citizens have experienced trauma and struggle with mental health in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Violence and a lack of mental health infrastructure make it challenging to obtain statistics on mental health in the DRC. One 2010 survey of DRC residents conducted by an international research team however outlines some of the ways in which the conflict has impacted the Congolese people. The survey found that since the start of the First Congo War 39.7% of women and 23.6% of men had experienced sexual violence and 67% of the nation had experienced human rights abuses in connection with conflict including harm to property and several types of violence.

Symptoms of mental health disorders were also common among participants with about 41% matching symptom criteria for major depressive disorder and 50% meeting the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition more than one in four study participants reported experiencing suicidal ideation within the last year at the time of the survey.

Barriers to Access

Despite the prevalence of violence and subsequent mental health problems very few people in the DRC receive psychiatric care. Some of the obstacles preventing Congolese from accessing mental health care include a lack of education and cultural beliefs. Many Congolese people attribute the symptoms of psychiatric disorders to spiritual problems or black magic. As a result the typical Congolese person would seek help for a psychiatric disorder from a traditional healer or a priest rather than a trained health care professional.

For those Congolese who do attempt to seek psychiatric help though resources are scarce. According to data from 2020 the DRC had just one inpatient mental hospital and one hospital providing outpatient mental health services. Data from 2017 shows that there are only 0.08 psychiatrists and 0.02 psychologists per 100000 people in the DRC. In contrast 2017 data indicates that in the United States there are approximately 10.54 psychiatrists and 29.86 psychologists for every 100000 people.

Financial limitations can also hinder Congolese peoples’ access to mental health care. The DRC government does not allocate any money for the mental health sector so the cost of mental health treatments in the DRC care typically falls on individuals and their families. Poverty is prevalent in the DRC with 73% of people surviving on less than $1.90 a day in 2018 according to the World Bank. With widespread poverty few Congolese have the financial ability to access mental health care if they choose to seek it out.

Living Peace Institute

Though the current mental health situation of the Congolese people is dire there are groups working to help Congolese people struggling with psychiatric disorders. Living Peace Institute (LPI) established in 2015 is a nonprofit working to reduce gender-based violence in the DRC with a particular focus on the Kivu region.

One of LPI’s efforts teaching healthy coping mechanisms for dealing with trauma through group therapy has reached more than 3000 Congolese. Separately one study found that group psychotherapy helped to improve mental health symptoms of survivors of sexual violence in the DRC. Given the scarcity of mental health care providers in the DRC group therapy could be a powerful tool for helping Congolese people work through their experiences with violence and achieve better mental health in the absence of a high number of psychological professionals.

Heartland Alliance

The nonprofit organization Heartland Alliance also works to improve mental health resources for Congolese people. Founded in the 19th century to support Americans living in poverty Heartland Alliance now serves vulnerable populations in seven countries around the globe.

Since 2009 Heartland Alliance has been working to address issues of gender inequality human trafficking and mental health in the DRC. To increase access to mental health services in the DRC Heartland Alliance works with the Congolese government to place psychologists in more hospitals around the country and provide health care professionals with more information about mental health problems. Through these efforts Heartland Alliance has helped provide mental health services to more than 8000 Congolese people and participants who had experienced trauma reported “a 68% reduction in symptoms of PTSD depression and/or anxiety.”

Though intertwined problems of violence and lack of access to psychiatric care have had devastating impacts on mental health in the Democratic Republic of Congo simple therapies have the potential to help many Congolese overcome the trauma of conflict and violence.

About 25 people took part in it including representatives of the Polish diaspora the press and people associated with culture.

The unconventional biography of Igor Mann told by his daughter in a colorful way although typical of the generation that survived World War II aroused great interest in the audience. A great value of the presentation was the rich iconographic material from the family's collection.

Born in Przemyśl in 1906 to a Jewish family he studied veterinary medicine at the Jagiellonian University and in Brno in the Czech Republic. After graduation he founded and ran his own veterinary practice in Katowice. After escaping from Poland in 1939 he ended up in Romania where he met his wife a Romanian citizen and after joining Nazi Germany in 1940 he had to flee again. He stayed in Palestine and Egypt then in Northern Rhodesia and finally in 1942 he settled in Kenya as a refugee. He could not practice as a veterinarian because his diplomas were not recognized by the colonial British authorities. He worked as a quality controller in meat plants. In 1965 he founded the Animal Health and Industries Training Institute (AHITHI) in Nairobi and became its first director. After retiring in 1973 he remained active working as a consultant to FAO and WHO. He died in 1986. The institution he founded still exists and the leather production department was named after Igor Mann.

He is together with his wife for about 20 years. And he is married for 14 years. However there is one thing that wouldn’t come to your mind – he is still against legal marriage in general.

Jessica Ditzel is a model born on July 18th 1975. Joe Rogan met Jessica Ditzel at a restaurant in Los Angeles where she worked as a cocktail waitress. They met in 2001 and are in a relationship ever since. At the moment that Joe met the model she already had a child (Kayla Rose now 25 years old). The father of Jessica’s daughter is her late fiancée Keven Conner who passed away before the child is born.

After 20 Years With His Wife Joe Rogan Is Still Against Legal Marriage

Jessica as well as Joe Rogan has broad working experience. She is a former model for the M Model Management modeling agency. She has worked at a Korean brand Wholesome she has been an account executive for Robert Half Technology and finally a manager at a rental car company.

Joe Rogan would choose not to marry his whole life. He speaks openly about his opposing the ‘need’ to go into a legal marriage. He even ‘confesses’ that if Jessica his wife would have not been pregnant most probably he would not have proposed to her.

“I had to tie the knot. Not really had to but you know she made a baby. It’s like ‘God alright I’ll sign a silly legal contract.’ What she did was way more of a commitment.” – Joe says in one episode of his podcast.

He also reveals that since he decided to get married he does have his wife sign a prenup. In 2001 Joe was not as wealthy as he is now but he just wanted to be on the safe side.

“Marriage is dumb.” Rogan says. “She lets me do whatever I do. That’s how we get along well. She doesn’t mess with me. A prenup? Of course. I’m ridiculous and dumb but I’m not stupid.” – Rogan says.

Rogan has two daughters with his wife Jessica. Lola and Rosy. Joe’s firstborn child Lola is born in 2008 before the couple enters into marriage. And the second one Rosy is born in 2010 two years later.

Joe Rogan is a person that tries to keep his family life as private as possible. He lives in an ‘isolated’ area without many people around him. He doesn’t post photos or videos of his loved ones and he even avoids speaking about his family.

Jessica Rogan is even more careful when it comes to privacy. She even has her Instagram account private and doesn’t accept people she doesn’t personally know."

Adopting an animal gives it a second chance at life. When adopting from the Humane Society you are helping multiple animals including the one you take home and the one that the Humane Society now has room to care for.

The Humane Society is a no-kill shelter meaning they will not put down any dogs to make space for new dogs. At the shelter the only time an animal is put down is if they are too sick and unable to make a recovery.

Many of the dogs at the Humane Society are strays that have been dropped off or brought in by the dog warden. The Humane Society is not the dog warden but they do work together to get stray animals off of the streets. They also receive animals through surrenders. At the moment Jenn Thomas executive director for the Ross County Humane Society says they receive multiple calls a day from people looking to surrender pets.

One reason some people buy from a breeder instead of adopting is because they want a specific breed. However many animal shelters have a variety of dog breeds. The Ross County Humane Society tends to offer many pit bulls and mixed breeds but will sometimes see other breeds come in.

""We have every range of age and breeds"" Thomas.

Still Thomas understands that oftentimes the Humane Society does not have the smaller breeds people are looking for. While she wishes every prospective dog owner would adopt from them she reminds people that all dogs need loving homes including those in the stores or online. She cares more about people taking care of their pets than she does where they got them.

When adopting an animal it is important to know its personality and how it will fit into your life. That is one of the perks of adopting from a shelter as workers and volunteers are often able to accurately tell you the personality of the animal you want.

Here is a look at some of the dogs and their personalities that are currently available for adoption from the Ross County Humane Society.

Marshall is a 2-year-old pitbull who has been with the Humane Society for over six months. This high-energy ""tank"" of a dog as Thomas calls him loves running and playing outside.

Poncho is a 2-year-old pitbull mix. Due to being born with leg deformities Poncho takes pain medicine but other than that he is a happy normal dog. Poncho is very gentle sweet and loves people. He also enjoys car rides.

Thidwick is a 2-year-old mastiff mix who was named after a Dr. Seuss character. It is apt that being named after a friendly moose Thidwick weighs around 80 pounds. Despite his size he is very sweet and loves to chase after tennis balls.

These animals and many more are available for adoption through the Ross County Humane Society. The simple adoption application cost $200 for puppies and adult dogs and $100 for senior dogs. This fee includes a spay or neuter voucher age-appropriate vaccines deworming microchip current dog tags and a heartworm test.

The Everyday Extra program is part of Everyday Rewards but offers added benefits that users on the free service won’t receive.

For $7 per month or a discounted annual rate of $59 shoppers will receive bonus points on every purchase and a once-a-month discounted shop.

Total benefits include:

Extra Discount: 10% off one shop per month at Woolworths and 10% off one shop per month at BIG W

Extra Points: 3x Everyday Rewards points on every shop at Woolworths and BIG W (please note points exclusions apply on certain products)

Extra Perks like free products exclusive subscriber offers and extra points boosters

The average Australian household spends more than $250 per week on groceries according to Budget Direct which could result in a saving of $25 per month on food.

By the same assumption a customer could save $300 per year while triple points will also help shoppers get to their $10 vouchers faster.

Woolworths said their most engaged customers could save $400 a year or more after paying the monthly fee.

Everyday X Managing Director Hannah Ross said the savings will go a long way to support customers with the rising costs of living.

“Now more than ever customers are looking for ways to save money on their weekly shop and get the most value each time they shop in our stores or online"" Ms Ross said.

“With the trial of Everyday Extra we’re providing our customers with another way to save on their shop and unlock even more value from our Everyday Rewards program helping them to save hundreds of dollars a year.

“Given the popularity of our Everyday Rewards program with our customers we hope our members who subscribe to Everyday Extra will quickly see the added value it will provide them every time they are at the checkout.”

How does it work?

Everyday Extra is linked to a customer’s existing Everyday Rewards card so the process for gaining points and discounts will be the same – by simply scanning your card at the checkout.

At the moment the program is in an ‘early access’ phase with a limited number of memberships on offer to existing Everyday Rewards members.

“Once the limit of Everyday Rewards members able to enjoy early access of Everyday Extra is reached no additional members will be able to subscribe until Everyday Extra is made available to all members” the Woolworths website states.

“During this early access period we’re still working on a couple of things to make Everyday Extra better ahead of making it available to all members.”

Woolworths says customers can save as much as $400 a year on groceries with the new subscription service. Source: AAP/File

Woolworths launches new app to get groceries delivered in 60 minutes

During the week Woolworths launched another new service offering a way for time-poor customers in 11 Sydney suburbs to get their groceries in under an hour.

The supermarket giant believes the app Metro60 will be the ""next big name in online grocery shopping”.

Through the Metro60 app customers can purchase items and their orders will be fulfilled through Woolworths Metro stores.

Woolworths customers have more than 4000 products to choose from on the app and in addition to getting fresh produce meat dairy and health products they will be able to snap up hot roast chickens and fresh sushi.

”Our busy customers are already familiar with the convenience a Woolworths Metro provides when they’re on the go"" Woolworths Chief Transformation Officer Von Ingram said in a statement.

""And we see Metro60 as an opportunity to offer a new level of ultra-convenience and help customers save even more time.”

While onboard the 2022 President's Cruise Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley announced the dates and location for the 2023 President's Cruise.

Mr. Bayley held an impromptu poll during an event onboard Ovation of the Seas and asked for a show of hands who would vote for Allure from Galveston or a European cruise. The crowd overwhelming voted for Allure.

""You've done a great job today. We're going to sail out of Galveston Texas"" Mr. Bayley said following the vote.

It will be held on Allure of the Seas on the July 23 2023 sailing from Galveston Texas.

This is a 7-night western Caribbean cruise that visits Roatan Costa Maya and Cozumel.

It should not come as a major surprise that Allure of the Seas was chosen given Royal Caribbean's new cruise terminal will be opening there in November 2022.

Terminal 3 is where Royal Caribbean's new $125 million home for Allure of the Seas and is located at Pier 10 for exclusive use by Royal Caribbean.

Royal Caribbean says it will be a state-of-the-art building that will measure 161300 square feet.

Not only can Terminal 3 handle Oasis Class ships it will also be able to accommodate Royal Caribbean's new Icon Class ships.

What is a President's Cruise?

Essentially a Royal Caribbean President's Cruise is a regular sailing that anyone can book but the appeal is for Royal Caribbean fans who want to go on a cruise together.

Hosted by the President and CEO of Royal Caribbean it is a giant celebration of the cruise line for its loyal guests.

On past President's Cruises there have been special events such as celebrity musicians who have performed onboard. This year's lineup includes classic rock band ""Foreigner"".



Patti LaBelle & Michael Bayley on a past President's Cruise

In addition there are surprises and commemorative opportunities for anyone onboard.

Part of the appeal of a President's Cruise is a lot of loyal Royal Caribbean fans book it making it a kind of homecoming experience among cruise fans.

There are multiple developments from Carnival and for a change most are good! There are also things you need to know about Princess Cruises P&O Cruises Celebrity Cruises and Disney Cruise Line.

We’ve got lots of cruise news updates for you from the past week across all the major cruise lines and it has been a busy time for Carnival Cruise Line with changes on protocols Costa ships joining the fleet and a popular onboard event making a comeback.

We’ve also got news on Princess Cruises cancellations a huge development as one cruise line tries dropping pre-cruise testing and Disneys’s new cruise ship arrives in Florida. Celebrity Cruises hits a massive milestone as Celebrity Infinity doesn’t just complete the fleet comeback but the comeback for all Royal Caribbean Group cruise lines.

Carnival Eases Protocols for Going Ashore

In a message sent to travel partners as well as changes to its Have Fun. Be Safe. protocols Carnival Cruise Line has dropped its requirement that unvaccinated guests only book shore tours or else remain on board in ports of call.

The cruise line now says that unvaccinated guests are permitted to go ashore to enjoy tours or independent sightseeing regardless of vaccination status.

This means that guests who have received vaccination exemptions may now choose to arrange independent shore tours not offered by Carnival or simply debark the ship to explore on their own.

Previously Carnival’s protocols stated that unvaccinated guests age 12 and older could not visit ports of call on their own and may only go ashore if booked on a Carnival shore excursion.

However the update doesn’t apply to all ports of call as they are not yet all permitting unvaccinated guests to go ashore. The ports that are still restricted to unvaccinated guests aged 12 and over are San Juan Bonaire Grand Cayman St. Kitts and Tortola. For Grand Turk guests aged 16 and over won’t be able to go ashore and guests aged 18 and over won’t be able to go ashore in Cartagena Columbia.

The cruise line is slowly easing its protocols and more changes could be on the way very soon. the CDC already confirmed to Cruise Hive last week that it was reassessing its pre-cruise testing requirement for cruise ships.

Princess Cruises Cancellations

Princess Cruises has announced more cancellations that impact those guests cruising in Australia. The Majestic Princess voyages from March 7 2023 through March 9 2023 have now been canceled.

These sailings are part of a longer 18-day itinerary which can be split up using different departure ports. Princess Cruises said the reason for the cancellations resulted from recent deployment changes.

The March 7 Australian Seacation sailing was scheduled to depart from Sydney and end in Brisbane on March 9. There was also a much longer 18-day Asia & Australia sailing departing on the same day and ending in Hong Kong on March 25 2023. The third impacted sailing is the 16-day Asia & Australia voyage from Brisbane to Hong Kong.

The cruise line is offering alternative options for guests booked on the impacted Majestic Princess sailings. There are recommended replacement voyages with a two-day sailing from Sydney departing on April 6 2024 a 21-day sailing from Sydney departing on April 6 and a 19-day voyage that departs Brisbane on April 8 2024.

More Costa Ships to Carnival Cruise Line

Carnival Cruise Line is going full Italian style with “COSTA by Carnival” and bringing two more Costa cruise ships to the Carnival fleet.

Costa Venezia will join in Spring 2023 and debut out of New York City while Costa Firenze will join in 2024 and debut under her new cruise brand out of Long Beach California.

The cruise line is bringing the Italian style of cruising to the U.S. market and guests will get to enjoy the stunning Italian-inspired decor that both the ships offer.

This follows the recent announcement that Costa Luminosa will be joining the Carnival Cruise Line fleet in November 2022. That ship however will be completely rebranded and renamed Carnival Luminosa while Costa Venezia and Costa Firenze will be retaining their Costa Cruises identities.

Both ships will undergo dry dock work prior to relocating to the United States but full details on that work have not yet been released.

Carnival Cruise Line already operates three Vista-class vessels in the Fun Ship fleet: Carnival Vista Carnival Horizon and Carnival Panorama which joined the line in 2016 2018 and 2019 respectively.

The two Costa ships are younger sisters in the class with Costa Venezia having debuted in 2019 and Costa Firenze in 2020.

P&O Cruises Drops Pre-Departure Testing

P&O Cruises the largest UK-based cruise line is temporarily removing the testing mandate for at least one ship. The Carnival Corporation-owned cruise line operates cruises mainly from the UK where the government removed entry requirements to come into the country on March 18 2022.

In a letter to guests P&O Cruises announced it will remove the need for pre-departure testing onboard its flagship Iona. This would only be for a limited amount of time from 25 June to 23 July 2022.

During the five voyages in this period any guests considered fully vaccinated will no longer need to purchase or take a lateral flow (antigen) test before boarding the ship.

The voyages in question are departures out of Southampton UK on June 25 July 2 July 9 July 16 and July 23.

Any non-vaccinated guests will still need to adhere to the testing requirements. This includes all guests over the age of 12. Guests aged 16 years and over will also need to have a booster shot if more than 270 days have passed since their final dose.

Also Iona is sailing on a series of short cruises which all have the same itinerary. This gives the cruise line the chance to evaluate each voyage and see if there is a basis for expanding the policy to other ships in the fleet.

Disney Wish Arrives in the U.S.

Disney Cruise Line’s newest cruise ship the highly-anticipated Disney Wish arrived at her new homeport of Port Canaveral shortly before sunrise Monday June 20 2022. The ship sailed from Germany on June 9.

She was escorted by a flotilla of Port-based tugboats and the Port Canaveral Fire Rescue Fireboat 2 providing the traditional water cannon salute.

Disney Wish was welcomed to her new Florida home by cruise ship fans that lined up at Jetty Park a popular area for viewing cruise ships sailing into Port Canaveral. In the coming days the vessel will be preparing for her first official guest voyage which will set sail on June 29.

The ship had been scheduled to commence operations as early as January this year. However supply chain issues and delays due to COVID-19 meant the ship only left the shipyard for final outfitting and sea trials in March.

The fifth ship in the fleet will operate three- and four-night itineraries to the Bahamas including Disney’s own private island Castaway Cay. Disney Wish is 144000 gross tons and has a guest capacity of 2500 at double occupancy.

Carnival Brings Back Popular Event

In a sign that crew shortages are easing a bit (which we will get into shortly) Carnival Cruise Line is now able to bring back the popular loyalty parties for its Diamond and Platinum “Very Important Fun Person” (VIFP) guests.

This is sure to be a welcome announcement for many passengers as the parties are a highlight of the cruise for many past guests.

These events are highly anticipated by many loyal Carnival cruisers and often include free drinks and appetizers visits from the ship’s officers and a popular video showcasing every Carnival cruise ship from the line’s founding in 1972 to the newest and upcoming vessels.

The VIFP events were temporarily canceled in mid-May due to short staffing on Carnival’s ships and guests were offered different compensation as a substitute for the missed events.

More good news coming for Carnival Cruise Line as the staffing issues are improving. A backlog of visa applications to process was part of the cause of the cruise line’s staffing shortages and Carnival Cruise Line has been working with representatives from the U.S. government to ease the backlog and return eager crew members to their vessels.

It is taking some time but hopefully soon not just Carnival but other cruise lines too will be able to be back fully staffed.

All Celebrity Cruise Ships Back Sailing

We end with some more good news as Celebrity Infinity returns to service after 881 days on pause due to the industry-wide suspension which started in March 2020. The Celebrity cruise ship is departing on June 25th from Fort Lauderdale Florida on a seven-night Eastern Caribbean sailing with stops in the Bahamas Turks & Caicos and the Dominican Republic.

Celebrity Infinity is offering alternating seven-night Eastern and Western Caribbean itineraries with all cruises having a call to Bimini or Nassau and Key West. The Eastern Caribbean sailings will have additional visits to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The Western Caribbean sailings will feature additional ports in Belize and Cozumel.

It does get even better as the Celebrity cruise ship marks a huge milestone not just for Celebrity Cruises but also for parent company Royal Caribean Group.

It does now mean that all 63 Royal Caribbean Group cruise ships are back sailing. To mark the huge milestone the entire fleet will sound their horn on Saturday June 25 in celebration and to honor the crew.

Craig Zahler’s Gangster Thriller in Cannes (EXCLUSIVE),"Writer-director S. Craig Zahler (“Bone Tomahawk”) is set to reunite with his “Dragged Across Concrete” and “Brawl in Cell Block 99” star Vince Vaughn and Oscar winner Adrien Brody (“The Pianist”) for upcoming crime thriller “The Bookie & the Bruiser.”

Anton will introduce the film to international distributors at the upcoming Marche du Film in Cannes. UTA Independent Film Group and Range Media Partners arranged the financing and will be representing the North American distribution rights.

Set in 1959 New York “The Bookie & the Bruiser” follows a pensive Jewish fellow named Rivner and an oversized Italian-American tough named Boscolo from the Lower East Side both of whom served overseas during WWII and returned changed men who no longer fit inside the lives they’d left behind. Uninterested in taking orders from bosses or playing by the rules of polite society the two friends partner up as a bookmaker and an enforcer and create an illicit gambling operation that proves to be very profitable though risky and their situation gets rather sticky when they find themselves stuck between a powerful Irish gang and the Mafia. The film is currently in pre-production and is planned for a fall 2024 shoot.

Anthony Katagas — an Oscar winner for “12 Years a Slave” and one of the most prolific producers in U.S. indie film having worked across titles including “Lost City of Z” “Ad Astra” “Uncut Gems” and “Armageddon Time” — will produce via his Keep Your Head Productions alongside Dave Caplan. C2 Motion Picture Group is fully financing the project.

“We are thrilled to be working with the visionary S. Craig Zahler on this action-packed tale of a searing conflict between the Irish-American and Italian Mafias in New York and see Vince and Adrien team up in this very unique power charged film” said Anton CEO Sébastien Raybaud.

“I’m honored and humbled to be working with one of my favorite filmmakers” added Caplan. “A S. Craig Zahler gangster movie is something I’m dying to watch.”

Anton’s current film slate includes Claude Barras’ animated feature “Savages” set to world premiere in Cannes’ official selection and “Memoir of a Snail” a stop motion animation from Oscar winning writer-director Adam Elliott (“Mary & Max”) which will make its market debut in Cannes ahead of a world premiere at the Annecy Film Festival. Anton will also debut an exclusive preview of 40 minutes of footage from “Night of the Zoopocalypse” a CGI animated feature from from the studios behind “Despicable Me” “Ice Age: Collision Course” and “Paw Patrol.” Other Anton titles include the heist thriller “Fuze” from the director David Mackenzie starring Aaron Taylor Johnson as well as Martin Campbell’s “Cleaner” starring Daisy Ridley Clive Owen and Taz Skylar.

C2 Motion Picture Group recently co-financed a number of high-profile Paramount films including “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning” “Transformers Rise Of The Beasts” “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” and “Babylon.” C2 also financed and produced the highly anticipated “Longlegs” which Neon is releasing this summer “In The Grey” with Lionsgate and Black Bear “Goodrich” with Ketchup Entertainment “The End We Start From” with Anton and Republic Pictures and “Azrael” with Republic Pictures. C2 is currently in post-production on Stephen King’s “The Monkey| with Range Media Partners and Atomic Monster producing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Fza2VkLXBhcmFzaXRlLWV4cGVydC1yZmstanItMjA0OTA3ODMxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We asked a parasite expert about RFK Jr.'s claim that a worm ate his brain. Here's what they said.,"Did a worm eat Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s brain?

The third-party presidential candidate said in a 2012 deposition that a doctor suggested a parasite hurt him.

We spoke to an expert who said a brain-eating tapeworm larvae would be impossible.

Brain-eating worms? Not likely.

A shocking report in The New York Times on Wednesday revealed that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested in a 2012 deposition that doctors had found a dead worm in his brain.

In the court proceeding — part of his divorce from his second wife — Kennedy said that he had short-term and long-term memory loss according to The Times.

Kennedy said he had visited doctors in 2010 who thought he had a brain tumor but another doctor suggested that a dark spot on Kennedy's brain scan was ""caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died"" The Times reported.

Kennedy argued in the deposition that he couldn't make as much money due to his health and also revealed that he had mercury poisoning around the same time.

Kennedy has portrayed himself as the younger more healthy alternative to the other two men running for president Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

His campaign's press secretary confirmed that Kennedy was infected with a parasite 10 years ago and said it was resolved. His campaign told Business Insider that Kennedy is in ""robust physical and mental health"" and said questioning his fitness is a ""hilarious suggestion given his competition.""

But could a parasitic worm even cause that kind of damage? One medical expert told Business Insider that Kennedy's version of events doesn't quite add up.

Dr. Janina Caira a University of Connecticut professor and tapeworm specialist told BI that Kennedy's parasite sounds more like the larvae of a pork tapeworm.

That would be rare Caira said in an email. Humans can be infected with the adult worm by eating undercooked pork but can only be infected with the larvae after eating food or drinking water contaminated by the feces of someone with an adult tapeworm infection.

""This typically happens in areas with poor sanitation"" Caira said. ""So it is possible that he could have contracted the infection in South Asia if he came into contact with food or water contaminated with eggs of the tapeworm.""

But there's no way the larvae could have consumed Kennedy's brain tissue.

""Absolutely not"" Caira wrote.

She said the larvae don't have mouths or digestive systems. Instead they absorb nutrients through the surface of their bodies. While Caira said it is possible that a worm could do some ""mechanical damage"" to nearby brain tissue the larvae are very small and a single one ""would not cause much damage.""

That lines up with what experts who were skeptical of the details told The New York Times.

However Dr. Peter Hotez a pediatrician and global health advocate who is a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology & microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine wrote on X that ""neuroparasitic diseases"" and ""parasitic worms have a huge impact on the human brain.""

Hotez said the diseases are seen in poor populations with a ""surprising amount of illness"" in southern states and Texas. He said his team at the National School of Tropical Medicine is working on low-cost vaccines to prevent the conditions.

The online collaboration platform formed only seven years ago has exploded in popularity as businesses around the world flock to its straightforward interface.

This success led to Slack being bought by CRM giant Salesforce for $27.7 billion and a year on TechRadar Pro spoke to Karl Nicholson Slack’s Director EMEA Executive Programs to find out what impact this has had and will have on the platform’s future.

Salesforce transition

“I think it's been a really great transition” Nicholson told us at the recent Salesforce World Tour event in London.

“When you look at Salesforce it is a very competent established company and Slack is a new racy move fast company. The way that Salesforce has managed that integration between the two companies has been very good and the thing I really appreciate is that we're learning from one another - so it's not a case of Salesforce consuming Slack in terms of just absorbing it into the ecosystem but us passing along our best practice of ways of working and also learning a thing or two from Salesforce as well.”

“We're very much leveraging each other's competencies and going to market together which is partly what the acquisition's all about.”

Slack has revolutionized how co-workers and businesses stay in touch around the world but the company’s big idea now is to help create a “digital HQ” where Nicholson says that users can enjoy a much closer amalgamation of people process and technology.

“Ultimately it’s about doing what's right for your business and your company. We have a point of view of Slack in the way that we do things but ultimately it really does come down to what you want to do as a business and what's right for your company.”

Going flexible

Flexibility seems to be the watchword as recent research carried out by Slack’s Future Forum found the majority of workers who have been called back to their offices five days a week are returning reluctantly - with over half (55%) saying they would prefer to work flexibly at least part of the time.

“We've talked about flexibility being key not only when people work but also where people work - and I think you need that digital-first approach that digital HQ approach to enable that ultra flexibility - digital is the place where you bring everything together” Nicholson said.

“Slack can be extremely transformative and fundamentally a better more pleasant way of working (but) we don't want to dictate the way that people work ultimately and a digital HQ is not designed to replace in person engagement” he added. “It's just designed to be a digital-first approach to the way of running your business.”

Another part of this is building what Nicholson calls a “digital workbench” within Slack allowing for collaboration across files and documents to bring together different platforms and stacks.

“When we think of how work gets done I think one of the big gaps in the market right now is when we look at tools like Zoom it's designed for presentations designed for one person to present to a group” he notes.

“A gap in the market as we see is creating that kind of digital workbench - having multiple applications open and multiple people collaborating on different documents or images or whatever and bringing that all together within a channel-based way of working.”

As an example Nicholson highlighted recent upgrades to Slack Huddles its impromptu meeting tool which now allows the ability to spin up quick video chats (in addition to audio calls) multi-person screen-sharing emojis and reactions and message threads that pull through to the associated channel after the call has ended.

It is these kinds of features and additions that Slack hopes can help set it apart he told us.

“I think we are one of the few products in the industry that is agnostic” he said “we're not here to just connect to Salesforce or any other CRM - we really do want to be that engagement layer across the business.""

“When you think about all the different applications and different stacks that a company typically has they are multi-vendor - and so our play has always been that we want to be that engagement layer we want to be open and we want to make it as simple as possible to do business.”

“We could do too much - however we're an organization that internally says no to lots of things. So for every product or every feature that you see ship there's probably 25 that didn't make the grade and therefore we didn't deploy them.”

""Simplicity in technology is really difficult and I feel like Slack is doing a very good job of trying to make things as pleasant simple for our user base as we possibly can.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9yZWQtc294LWN0by1iYXNlYmFsbC10ZWFtcy1uZWVkLW1vZGVybi10ZWNoLXN0YWNrLWFzLW11Y2gtYXMtYW55LW90aGVyLWJpei_SAXFodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMjYvcmVkLXNveC1jdG8tYmFzZWJhbGwtdGVhbXMtbmVlZC1tb2Rlcm4tdGVjaC1zdGFjay1hcy1tdWNoLWFzLWFueS1vdGhlci1iaXovYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Red Sox CTO: Baseball teams need modern tech stack as much as any other biz,"You know a modern Major League Baseball team like the Boston Red Sox is built on a steady diet of data and analytics — this is true on the field just as much as in the front office.

While the main focus of a professional baseball club is building a competitive team that takes advantage of the unique talents of each player when you get down to it the Red Sox are no different from most businesses when it comes to their tech stack.

They make choices about sales and marketing tools data storage analyst dashboards — everything any company needs to run a business these days. The Red Sox like many companies are part of a larger corporate entity — in this case the Fenway Sports Group — so they need to understand when and how to share tech with other members of the corporate family when it makes sense.

There’s another wrinkle that most businesses don’t have to take into consideration: The Red Sox are also a part of Major League Baseball which has its own technology priorities that it shares with individual clubs.

As an example Vasanth Williams MLB’s head of engineering and chief product officer earlier this year told TechCrunch+ that the league has established a relationship with Google Cloud which could impact each individual club’s cloud infrastructure decisions:

We created a base platform that all clubs can leverage. That’s one of the things we’ve done in the last few years that is both on the fan side as well as on the baseball data side. We wanted to bring all the data and make that accessible in an easy way. Back in the day it was all on-premise and in different data centers. We put it all in the cloud and made it much easier for them to query and build analytics on.

To learn more about how the Boston Red Sox uses technology to run its business (and play the game) we spoke to Brian Shield the club’s chief technology officer.

A look at the stack

Shield said his job is similar to that of a CTO at any large organization trying to define and drive the company’s technology strategy but the requirements of a baseball club aren’t always the same.

“I like to think the biggest buckets are the traditional sort of business systems” he said. “Then we’ve got a big presence around understanding fan behavior and elements around that. Then we have baseball and baseball systems and everything there is around the players. And finally we’ve got Fenway Park and how we use technology to service fans.”

But it doesn’t end there. “It gets a bit more complicated when we start adding in minor league franchises and five different facilities in the Dominican Republic and you start getting into some of our other organizations [across Fenway Sports Group]” he added.

The Red Sox want to take advantage of being part of Fenway Sports Group to the extent possible. In addition to the Red Sox the group owns the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team and the Liverpool Football Club among others.

“The Fenway Sports Group portfolio continues to grow. And as it grows on the technology side we’re spending a lot more time together than we ever did before ensuring as best we can that we’re not reinventing wheels; that we’re benefiting from best practices and a host of things” Shield said.

What does that look like?

The club has a lot going on when it comes to software. While the team had been using a mix of vendors for many years more recently they’ve been trying to standardize with certain tools including Salesforce for sales and marketing; ServiceNow for internal and external customer service; Wasabi a Boston startup for cloud storage; and Google Cloud for infrastructure and platform services as part of the MLB push to standardize clubs on the platform.

“We made some strategic decisions to move to Google as our principal data environment relative to how we interoperate with certain fan-level data and we also made a decision to migrate 100% to Salesforce. Those turned out to be fortuitous because you know those are big investments that we made” he said.

The move to Google Cloud has enabled the team to have all their fan data in a single place and that in turn has helped them offer more individualized experiences based on what they know about each fan.

In 2020 the club also decided to move all its sales and marketing data to Salesforce. Before then the sales teams hadn’t standardized on a single tool. “We’ve always been a hybrid historically between Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics across 13 different sales teams” Shield said.

“It took us about 18 months to fully get there but starting in early 2020 we’ve effectively gone all-Salesforce across the board and integrated that bidirectionally with everything that we do within this enterprise data warehouse [in Google Cloud].”

For storage and backup of much of the data the team collects Wasabi handles everything from player data Salesforce and GCP backups to tape archives and IoT and surveillance data from cameras and devices around the ballpark.

“Wasabi is turning out to be sort of a proverbial home run in that we are using it for all of our backups” Shield said.

That is not to say however that they’ve done away with all other vendors. They have such a large operation they still rely on other companies for various tasks related to storage. “Dell EMC remains an integral part of the day-to-day storage needs of the Red Sox for much of the internal operations of the business as well as baseball systems other key applications and the video production environment. Acronis a key cyber security partner plays a critical role in storage to address cybersecurity ransomware and other data recovery areas” he said.

Help from a friend

Unsurprisingly all of this was a highly complex undertaking for a large organization to pull off. The club did not try to go it alone and brought in Flywheel Software a Boston company that characterizes itself as a “no-code data activation platform.”

“Flywheel helped us figure out how to integrate all this data pulling all these data sources together and then [showed us] how to structure that architect that in a single view of a fan model” he said.

Flywheel also helped the club coordinate its relationship with MLB more effectively to leverage the work MLB had already done. Finally using a Flywheel product called Audience Builder the team can create targeted marketing campaigns while handling all the bidirectional integration with Salesforce.

All of that helps the Red Sox with everything from data privacy to certain compliance issues reporting integration being able to take advantage of machine learning multicloud integration and DevOps. Shield said that the general design of the architecture is being shared across MLB.

Customizing and moving forward

The Red Sox have modernized and centralized its data stack across a set of tools allowing it to do more including building custom applications on top of the tech stack to meet the team’s unique needs.

As an example the company is working on using IoT to better understand fan behavior inside Fenway. Shield said that is something they have long aspired to do but the updated tech stack really opened up the possibilities.

“If you’ve been to Fenway this year or a little bit last year you know there’s mobile food ordering now and if you’re like me someone who has been coming to Fenway for many years you probably thought that would never happen” he said.

Built in 1912 the park has been updated over the years but the kinds of modern offerings available in newer ballparks seemed a distant dream until the club built the tooling to accommodate it.

Besides letting the audience order food Red Sox can now collect more data from concessions and from mobile devices as fans move about the park. The technology lets them store more information and make better use of it to improve the fan experience at the game.

Years ago Baseball Ops built an analytics engine called Carmine which has since been put out to pasture and replaced with a cloud-enabled cousin called Beacon in 2017. While that’s the most famous Red Sox proprietary app it’s not the only one the team has built. Shield said they have more than 25 additional apps enabling the business side of the house to dig into the data.

Shield said the cloud architecture is what drives and makes all of it possible — grabbing data in near real time when it makes sense and over time when it’s less crucial all while storing and processing copious amounts of data to improve the team across all departments.

The Boston Red Sox are not a typical business: They have to fill a stadium with fans and play baseball at a high level while simultaneously cooperating with Fenway Sports Group and Major League Baseball. But when it comes to requiring a modern tech stack to take maximum advantage of technology to get the most out of their employees and their business operations it’s all pretty … typical.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjI0LTdwcmVzc3JlbGVhc2UuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UvNDkyMzAxL2RhbWNvLXNvbHV0aW9ucy1mb3JheXMtaW50by1sb3ctY29kZS1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Damco Solutions Forays into Low-Code Application Development,"PRINCETON NJ June 25 2022 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Damco Solutions a New Jersey based technology system integrator recently announced its foray into low-code application development.

Would it actually go ahead or would Covid return? Would we all feel comfortable being face to face again? And was an event so tied to luxury and excess appropriate in today’s world? This latter point only became stronger as the Ukraine war and the cost of living crisis took over the headlines in the run up to the event.

As it turns out perhaps somewhat predictably on arrival in Cannes these concerns seemed to get swept away by the Cote d’Azur magic and minds quickly turned to questions about the metaverse and NFTs how to balance client meetings with the parties that took place along the beach every night and just how blooming hot it was.

A few events burst the bubble. Ukranian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared by video call to remind everyone about the very serious and urgent events taking place in his country; Greenpeace staged a series of protests railing against brands greenwashing; the industry’s lack of diversity continued to be widely discussed and despaired about; and a documentary titled Kill Your Darlings encapsulated creatives’ angst about agency models and where advertising was going.

Despite this though the rosé flowed everyone bathed in the glow of the clutch of celebs who popped up to do talks and perform at parties – Paris Hilton on NFTs anyone? – and the very serious troubles of today felt pretty far away.

They resurfaced in the winning work however which as seems to be de rigour in ad award shows these days leant heavily towards the purpose and ‘good-vertising’ end of the creative spectrum. This had a mixed impact – there was plenty of evidence of the skill ingenuity and design thinking that’s present in the industry today though at times the resulting projects felt somewhat removed from the brands they were supposedly created for.

The winners also gave the impression of an industry that takes itself very seriously. While Ryan Reynolds – who played a dual role as movie star and savvy ad man/client at the festival – called out for advertising to be “fun” it would seem the jurors didn’t quite get the memo.

Ultimately though Cannes Lions revealed the vast breadth of ideas and talent in the ad and design industry today. Below I have gathered all the Grand Prix-winning work for you to savour for yourself. Go on tuck in:

Two well-known Hawkes Bay real estate businesses are joining forces.

The team from Cox Partners Estate Agents are transitioning to the Tremains Real Estate

Cox Partners principal Malcolm Cox is retiring from the business.

""Tremains is a good fit for our team because we share common values priorities and standards"" Cox said.

Both the Cox family and Tremain family have been committed to serving Napier for decades.

Cox Partners was founded by Malcolm's grandfather Clarence over 100 years ago and the business has focused on developing a small highly trained team of professionals who deliver exceptional results.

Tremains was started more than 50 years ago by Simon Tremain's father - rugby legend Kel Tremain.

Under Simon Tremain's leadership along with business partner Cam Ward the Tremains business has grown significantly in recent years expanding the brand beyond Hawke's Bay to Taupo Rotorua Tauranga and Wairarapa.

The Courier-Mail can reveal the buyers who splashed hundreds of millions of dollars on real estate across Queensland in the past 12 months.

The 2022 financial year will be remembered as one of the state’s biggest on record with more than $700m worth of property changing hands in just the top 50 transactions.

For the first time ever every sale in the list was over $11m with coastal pandemic retreats the most prized possessions — from beach houses to house-sized apartments with ocean views for days.

Mining magnates were among the big spenders including Australia’s richest person Gina Rinehart who paid $21.5m in February for a beachfront property in Sunshine Beach — barely six months after buying another mansion in the same suburb for $34m.

Throw in a racing car driver a couple of farmers property developers and a mindfulness philanthropist and you have some idea of where the money is coming from.

The biggest reported home sale of the financial year in Queensland was a Shaun Lockyer designed mansion on a 636sqm oceanfront block which sold for $28.5m.

The home had been built by Samantha and Brad Hopper who had paid only $4.85m for the property in 2016.

Records show it was purchased offmarket by Karen Greer wife of Wilson Asset Management founder Geoff Wilson — a Sydney investment manager.

The Sunshine Coast also secured the year’s highest regional coastal apartment sale when a Hastings Street Noosa Heads auction saw $16.1m paid by software pioneer Mark Suhr.

The Hastings Park unit was sold by international insurance veteran Paul Steffens and wife Amanda through Tom Offermann of Tom Offermann Real Estate.

A waterfront house on Mossman Court also sold for $17.1m through Mal Cox of Tom Offermann Real Estate.

The Flynn family had paid just $2.1m for the property in 1999 then undertook a $1.8m extension 12 years ago. It sold to an interstate buyer.

A humble brick home built nearly four decades ago sold for $16.2m in a deal that settled just yesterday.

Records show the vendor Nicholson Investments paid just $90000 in the mid-80s for the knockdown house at 32 Noosa Pde Noosa Heads.

Tom Offermann of Tom Offermann Real Estate who negotiated the sale said the Brisbane-based buyers — Laurie and Gail Smith — also owned the house next door at 34 Noosa Pde and planned to demolish the one at 32 and create one house across the two blocks.

“It’s a growing trend for people to want more space around them on Noosa Sound” Mr Offermann said. “There are currently four properties on double lots there now.”

Down the street veteran property developer Kevin Seymour paid $15.5m for a double block on the water in Noosa Parade.

The 81-year-old said he plans to demolish the two existing commercial and apartment buildings on the huge 1120 sqm site with a 20m water frontage and build a “Hawaiian-inspired resort-style home” for he and his wife Kay.

“I’ve had my eye on it for quite some time” Mr Seymour said. “The vendors didn’t want to sell until recently.”

And his daughter Leigh has just bought the house across the road for $16.5m in a deal that settles in August.

Also in Noosa 53 Witta Circle sold to former mining boss turned mindfulness philanthropist Kerry Harmanis who owns more than $30m worth of property in the street.

The successful businessman made his fortune in the resources sector as the founder of Jubilee Mines which he sold in 2008.

“Quite a lot of secrecy surrounds some of these premium property sales because buyers or owners are often well-known and want to avoid having their private business publicised” Mr Offermann said.

The prestige agent also marketed 68 Noosa Parade which went to auction last weekend and was passed in for $18.1m.

Negotiations are underway to buy the seven-bedroom four-bathroom waterfront home owned by Brisbane couple David and Judy Tynan.

But the action wasn’t all in Noosa.

Local developer and designer Heidi Meyer sold her luxurious Buderim hinterland estate for $17.1m to Cairns property tycoon Alex Sekler and his wife Violetta.

Ms Meyer went on to spend $16.45m at Noosa Heads in October buying a home listed for the first time in four decades in Picture Point Crescent.

And a massive waterfront mansion on exclusive Minyama Island sold for $12m to AIB Insurance managing director Vicki Warne.

On the southern end of the coast businessman Clive Palmer paid $20m for a Sovereign Islands mansion that had been owned by German super yacht builder Klaus Lilischkies.

The house on the site at 15-17 King Arthurs Court has since been demolished and replaced with concrete to be used as a helipad.

The Gold Coast’s Sanctuary Cove precinct saw a $17.7m sale when Johnson Property Holdings director Terence Johnson sold to Gold Coast business identity Tony Quinn.

Quinn whose sale of VIP Pet Foods in 2015 secured $410m subsequently sold his Surfers Paradise home for $10m in an off-market deal that settled just before Christmas.

Mermaid Beach’s so-called Millionaires’ Row also saw some big money change hands in the past 12 months.

The third biggest recorded sale in Queensland in the past 12 months was a beachfront home at 213 Hedges Avenue which fetched $21.75m.

Formerly owned by Harvey Norman Queensland boss Stephen Cavalier the property was purchased by Stone & Wood Brewing Company director Ross Jurisich and Light Years Skin Studio founder Megan Jurisich.

Pub owner tourism entrepreneur and Computershare co-founder Chris Morris also sold his Hedges Avenue mansion for a hefty $21m.

A vacant 900sq m Hedges Avenue block sold for $17.5m in August when offloaded by Nava Abedian the wife of developer Sahba Abedian.

It was bought by Andrew Fahey co-founder of online bookmaker PointsBet through Kollosche Prestige.

Brisbane could not compete with the coasts when it came to the sheer volume of multimillion-dollar sales but it did notch up some impressive results.

A brick house near Sunnybank Plaza sold for a whopping $17.25m to a local developer in March.

Jimmy Lu of Ray White Sunnybank Hills who negotiated the sale of the six-bedroom house on nearly 1ha in Robertson said there was no sign of the market slowing down in the Sunnybank area with locals looking to capitalise on the expected growth in the lead-up to the 2032 Olympic Games.

“The market drove the price for sure” he said. “Five years ago you might have gotten $10m.”

The previous highest residential sale on Brisbane’s southside was in November when a home at 148 Algester Rd ­Calamvale fetched $16.5m. That also sold to a developer.

A last-minute addition to the list was a unique riverfront home at 29 Laidlaw Pde East Brisbane which sold for $12.5m last week through Michael Bacon of Place Estate Agents.

And at the time of going to print the industry was abuzz with rumours about who has just bought a rundown riverfront home in Oxlade Drive New Farm for $15m.

A Brisbane barrister also paid $12.5m for a palatial 10-bedroom riverfront home at Tennyson which had been sitting on the market for four years.

Place Bulimba’s Sarah Hackett brokered the sale of 121 King Arthur Tce on behalf of local businessman Mark Brodie.

Another home that had been on the market for a long time finally sold for $12.27m.

Glenn and Amanda Rohrig of Rohrig Constructions sold the home at 10 Morgan St Ascot through Matt Lancashire of Ray White New Farm.

Records show the buyer was Linden Lawson the director of Austrack Campers.

And a riverfront estate at 78 Jilba St Indooroopilly fetched $12m with Jason Adcock of Adcock Prestige.

Janet Jackson has paid a sweet tribute to her late brother Michael on the 13th anniversary of his death.

On June 25 2009 the world lost the performer frequently referred to as the King of Pop – one of the most prominent figures of 20th-century music.

His sister legendary singer actress and fellow member of the Jackson family Janet remembered his passing by posting a sweet picture of them on her Instagram account.

It shows a young Michael and Janet standing side by side in front of a window with a skyline view in the background.

The That’s The Way Love Goes songstress accompanied the post with simple white heart emoji leaving fans emotional.

The Thriller hitmaker died from cardiac arrest at the age of 50.

Over the years Janet has honored Michael’s memory on many occasions particularly on social media.

In her much-talked-about documentary that aired earlier this year the 56-year-old detailed the often complicated relationship between the pair from childhood leading up to his death.

As kids she said she and Michael were inseparable with her being closest to him and brother Randy out of her 10 siblings.

They had a bond though she revealed it wasn’t always perfect between herself and the 5-time Grammy Award winner – he would occasionally call her names and reference her weight.

‘We were close Randy Myself and Mike – we were like the three amigos – the three stooges’ Janet recalled.

The Poetic Justice actress said she felt a sting when Michael used to make fun of her weight.

‘There were times when Mike used to tease me and call me names’ the All For You singer said.

‘He would laugh about it and I’d laugh too but then there was somewhere down inside that it would hurt’ she confessed adding ‘When you have somebody say you’re too heavy it affects you.’

As they grew up and Michael became world-famous she recalled their relationship starting to shift.

‘I remember really loving the Thriller album but for the first time in my life I felt it was different between us a shift was happening’ she said.

‘That’s the time Mike and I started going our separate ways. He just wasn’t as fun as he used to be.’

In a memorable segment she mentioned their Scream duet and revealed Michael’s record company wanted the siblings kept apart during the filming of the music video which was one of the most expensive music videos ever made costing $7million to produce.

‘Michael shot nights I shot days. His record company would block off his set so I couldn’t see what was going on. They didn’t want me on set’ she revealed.

‘That really hurt me because I felt I was there fighting the fight with him not to battle him. I wanted it to feel like old times between he and I and it didn’t. Old times had long passed’ Janet remarked.

However Janet shared that she and her brother had a touching final moment the last time she saw him before his death.

‘He was sitting next to me and he was laughing like crazy and he had that deep laugh and I remember him looking over at me…and the last thing we said to each other was “I love you” and that was the last time I saw him.’

Manchester United captain Harry Maguire married childhood sweetheart Fern Hawkins in a gorgeous ceremony in France on Saturday.

The pair who have been together since they were in high-school tied the knot in the grounds of a lavish countryside chateaux surrounded by close friends and family. Maguire shared a charming snap of himself locking lips with his new wifey during the ceremony on his Instagram page captioning the post: ""A day I'll never forget.""

The wedding took place at the dreamy Chateau de Varennes in the south of France - which has been voted one of the top ten wedding venues in the world.

In order to obtain a UK marriage certificate the couple got officially hitched last month - in the slightly less romantic-sounding Crewe Registry Office - but wanted to take their vows again in style once the football season had been wrapped up.

Well-wishers from across the country flooded to the comments section of Maguire's Instagram post including a number of current and former teammates.

""Love it congratulations to you both"" wrote Arsenal and England goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.

""Congrats big guy"" former Leicester City midfielder Danny Drinkwater wrote while Jacob Mellis who spent several years with Maguire in Sheffield United's academy joked: ""Thanks for the invite mate congrats!""

Should Harry Maguire start for England at the World Cup later this year? Let us know in the comments section.

The happy day comes as a welcome relief for the couple who were forced to flee their Manchester home in April following a bomb scare.

Maguire has been under intense pressure for months following a seismic dip in form and with United boss Erik ten Hag keen on bringing a new centre back in this summer the 29-year-old could be facing a fight for his future in the first-team.

In any case today's nuptials would've been the perfect distraction - a distraction he's probably deserved after the season he's had.

Ritesh Desai product engineering manager for Southern Linc said that Southern Company workers use the Ericsson-powered MCPTT service on Southern Linc almost all push-to-talk (PTT) communications and internally will cease using LMR technology entirely in the near future.

“Southern Company has one—and only one—geographic location that has LMR—and that is going to be gone fairly quickly” Desai said during an interview with IWCE’s Urgent Communications. “Once Catalyst comes around and we fully deploy it there that piece of the pie will disappear from Southern Company and we will have zero LMR and zero non-LTE communications means out there. So Southern will be fully LTE-based at that point.”

When this occurs it will mark a key milestone in a lengthy communications journey for Southern Linc which serves the southeastern U.S. as a carrier and provide communications support to the Southern Company utility. Southern Linc was among the first entities to commit to building a mission-critical LTE network in 2013 pursued MCPTT with Motorola Solutions and eventually opted for mission-critical technology from Ericsson.

Desai applauded the audio quality of MCPTT-to-MCPTT calls using the Ericsson technology.

“From a quality standpoint it’s probably the best audio people have ever heard—even above and beyond the previous Motorola system” Desai said. “It’s an upgrade from a vocoder perspective so the quality is on the top end of the spectrum.”

Southern Linc’s MCPTT supports all of the features and functionality that PTT users want and the reliability has improved noticeably in recent months according to Desai.

“We’ve had a couple of issues here and there over the past six months and they’ve been addressed” he said. “For the past four months—since February—it’s been quite stable and it looks to be that way moving forward.”

LMR may not be part of the future internal communications at the Southern Company and Southern Linc but narrowband technologies are expected to play a key role in the communications for many Southern Linc customers including governments and public-safety agencies.

Southern Linc customers utilize a wide variety of LMR technologies and it is important that each customer’s LMR users can communicate with its LTE users. After years of using donor-radio-based solutions Southern Linc plans to deploy the more scalable and more reliable Catalyst LMR-LTE interoperability solution—an offering showcased during the PSCR 2022 Broadband Stakeholders Meeting earlier this month—throughout its network during the next two years Desai said.

“We’re trying to upgrade that from donor-based solution to a wireline solution which Catalyst is able to provide” Desai said. “We understand that there’s IWF [3GPP’s Interworking Function] from a standards perspective but the Catalyst solution is a ‘now’ thing that’s readily available which is what we’re looking for.

“And they hit all of the buttons for what we needed. It’s a fairly small system from a deployment standpoint—it’s not like it’s several servers or something like that. It’s a small-scale deployment and there are multiple ways … to do it; there’s not just a one-size-fits-all type of thing. We’re able to buy components of that system to fit each of our individual customer’s needs.”

Catalyst’s current solution supports interoperability as a gateway—powered by Softil’s MCPTT stack—that leverages 3GPP standards from Release 12 not the IWF standard that was completed in March as part of Release 17.

Southern Linc is monitoring the development of IWF but very few vendors have made the new technology available yet Desai said.

“Scale is an issue and it all boils down to cost” Desai said. “If I needed to bridge a P25 system and I had a choice between IWF and a system that requires CSSI or even an LMR donor I would go with the IWF. It’s a pure wireline solution end-to-end in both cases and it’s standard-based.

“Catalyst I think will get there. They’re just not there yet I think.”

Desai said the existing Catalyst solution is being tested at Southern Linc customer locations and the initial feedback has been encouraging. Initial operational deployments are expected to begin with a large Alabama customer seeking statewide coverage late this year and continue throughout the Southern Linc footprint during the next couple of years assuming funding is available.

“I think that over the next 24 months a good chunk of our users that have a need to bridge calls between LMR and LTE will be using this [Catalyst] solution” Desai said.

In addition to deploying Catalyst’s interoperability solution throughout its network Southern Linc last week announced a partnership under which Southern Linc will promote and sell Catalyst’s LMR LTE Interworking solution in the southeast U.S.

Catalyst President Robin Grier expressed optimism about the partnership.

“It is my pleasure to announce that Catalyst technology will be available to Southern Linc customers through this Agreement.” Grier said in a prepared statement. “We are proud to be associated with Southern Linc and their excellent reputation for stellar customer service and problem-solving solutions for their customers.”

Southern Linc COO Carmine Reppucci echoed this sentiment.

“Catalyst has best-in-class technology and has been serving the public safety community with innovative communications solutions for 25 years.” Reppucci said in a prepared statement. “We look forward to helping Southern Linc customers move forward with this innovative new technology.”

One potential challenge for some Southern Linc customers is the fee assessed by some LMR vendors—most notably Motorola Solutions—to enable interoperability Desai said.

“Ultimately [paying this fee to the LMR vendor is] going to fall back to that [customer] organization—it’s not going to fall back to the Southern Lincs AT&Ts and Verizons” Desai said. “Somebody’s going to have to front that money and it’s likely going to be from the organization that needs it unfortunately.

“And as bad as it may sound … Aside from the fact that it lets you scale it’s going to be cost-prohibitive to smaller deployments. That’s just the fact of the matter if something doesn’t change in that [LMR fee]. Because of the licensing ISSI is just so expensive. It’s a seven-figure number oftentimes.”

This and other factors need to be considered by users when making interoperability plans Desai said. As with so many aspects of the wireless industry scale can have a significant impact on the best interoperability solution for a given entity he said.

“If you’re extra small—like a sheriff’s department with only 10 people with a [network] site or two—then go with your old legacy donor solution” Desai said. “Anything above that go with the Catalyst solution. And if you’re a carrier like us and you want to bridge carrier to carrier go with IWF.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iZWFzLXVzLTIwOS1taWxsaW9uLXNvdXRoZXJuLTA5MzAwMDA0NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BEA's new US$209 million southern China headquarters in Qianhai to serve as gateway to Greater Bay Area ...,"Bank of East Asia (BEA) a 104-year-old Hong Kong bank will move into its 1.4 billion yuan (US$209 million) southern China headquarters in Qianhai next year which will serve as a launch pad for its expansion in the Greater Bay Area.

The 20-storey tower will house the bank's new Qianhai branch its Greater Bay Area retail banking operation centre and innovation lab. About 500 employees will move in next year said co-chief executive Adrian Li Man-kiu a scion of the family that has run the bank for four generations.

""The Greater Bay Area has a huge population and its economy is growing at a much faster pace than many Western or Asian countries"" Li said. ""BEA's new headquarters in Qianhai which will open next year marks a new milestone in our bank's century of development on the mainland. This new investment signifies our commitment to the region and the nation.""

Li disclosed the bank's plan for Greater Bay Area in an interview with the South China Morning Post ahead of the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover on July 1.

Since the handover BEA has expanded its mainland branch network from 11 to 70 at present underscoring the Chinese market's importance for the Hong Kong- based lender where it competes with over 160 banks including some of the world's major banks.

BEA has over 1.3 million customers in Hong Kong and another 600000 in the Greater Bay Area.

""The mainland business is important to BEA"" said Everbright Securities International strategist Kenny Ng pointing out that operating income from the mainland business accounted for 29 per cent of the group's total revenues and 35 per cent of its net interest income.

Ng said BEA's strategy to focus on the Greater Bay Area was spot on as it can benefit from its tie-up with AIA China to sell investment products in the region and also from the Wealth Management Connect scheme.

Since 2019 Beijing has introduced measures to link Hong Kong Macau and nine mainland cities in Guangdong province into an integrated economic and business hub.

Story continues

""We have a sizeable branch network covering all 11 cities in the Greater Bay Area as well as a joint venture securities firm in Qianhai. We will continue to expand the range of services and products in the region"" Li said.

Li 48 is the fourth-generation scion of the family that founded BEA the city's first Chinese-owned bank. The lender was co-founded by his great grandfather Li Koon-chun great uncle Li Tse-fong and seven others on November 14 1918 just three days after the end of the first world war.

His father David Li Kwok-po 83 joined the bank in 1969 and was its chief executive from 1981 to 2109 when he handed over the reins to him and his brother Brian Li Man-bun. The brothers act as co-chief executives while their father serves as executive chairman.

""Our bank has seen a lot of changes since 1997 in terms of the technology products and services we provide. What is unchanged over this period is the priority we place on our customers and our people"" Li said.

The company has doubled its staff in Hong Kong and the mainland from 4100 in 1997 to 8800 currently. And it continues its tradition of offering staff free lunch. Employees at its headquarters in Central and BEA Tower in Kwun Tong are served lunch from Monday to Friday while the branch staff receive a food allowance.

Li who studied law at the University of Cambridge and has master of management degree from Northwestern University in the US worked as a lawyer for a few years before joining the bank in 2000.

He started in corporate banking for a decade helping companies to issue bonds and get loans before being promoted to deputy chief executive in 2009 and later as co-CEO in 2019.

BEA introduced internet banking in 1999 soon after the handover and mobile banking in 2010. Li said that digitalisation has helped the development of the city's banking sector.

""Digital banking is the way forward as it offers an enhanced customer experience. It also enables us to improve efficiency and reduce costs while protecting the environment"" he said. ""For example last year alone we reduced paper use by 30 per cent.""

Since the pandemic started over two years ago as well as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's promotion of digital banking an increasing number of people have started using banks' mobile apps for transactions cutting down on the need to visit branches.

HKMA data showed that 98 per cent of retail bank transfers were done digitally in the second half of last year with only 2 per cent conducted at bank branches.

""The trend is going to continue. BEA will continue to invest and develop more data-driven technologies to provide new products and services to customers"" Li said.

As customers shift to online banking BEA has cut its branch network in Hong Kong from 98 outlets in 1997 to 56 at present mirroring the trend seen across the industry.

However Li said branches were an integral part of its omnichannel service platform. BEA will open a new branch at the 11 Skies commercial complex adjoining Hong Kong International Airport next year which has been designed keeping in mind the needs of customers from the Greater Bay Area who can receive wealth management services once the border with mainland China reopens.

""We will continue to open new branch concepts in new locations but the design and purpose will be different"" he said.

Flying within the Hawaiian Islands is one of the easiest and cheapest flights you’ll ever take due to the heavy competition. With many airlines competing on only a handful of routes flights are usually very frequent and can be above 30-a-day between destinations.

Hawaiian Airlines Mokulele Airlines and most recently Southwest Airlines are the three airlines with the most passenger inter-island flights although a few other smaller companies do exist. Between the three airlines they operate almost 30-daily nonstops in each direction 21 of which are on Hawaiian Airlines.

A couple of weeks ago we went over one of those options with Mokulele in a “Unique Connection Series” trip report this time we will take the more conventional and the most known option; Hawaiian Airlines. The route does see each aircraft type in their fleet; the Boeing 717 Airbus A321 and occasionally the Airbus A330 but it usually tends to be the workhorse of their fleet the Boeing 717.

Day of the flight

I chose a morning flight option with the departing flight leaving Kahului at 9:05 A.M. I knew security wouldn’t be terrible as most of the early morning flights had already left plus I have TSA PreCheck which is always great. I arrived at the airport just an hour before the flight at 8 A.M. and made it through security with no problem.

The airline has a few special gates set aside for their inter-island operations. They have agriculture inspection areas set up in the terminal if you are headed towards any gates besides Hawaiian Airlines’ inter-island ones. Due to this unfortunately there weren’t many places to walk around but this wasn’t that bad as the flight was only an hour away.

It wasn’t long before my aircraft arrived N476HA one of the many Boeing 717’s the carrier possesses. This aircraft was named “Elepaio” after a bird species that is only found in the state of Hawaii.

These inter-island operations are very efficient and run like a well-oiled machine. As soon as the last person stepped off the inbound aircraft they began loading my flight.

The interior of this aircraft was simple but for the short flights they use these aircraft it is perfect. The seats are bright and give off a warm Hawaiian vibe.

Another interesting aspect of the flight is the labels every sign on the aircraft had the words written in Hawaiian under the English words.

I chose seat 25F for this flight this would be one of the instances where I should’ve looked at a seat map website before selecting this seat. The row was so far back my view was almost completely obstructed by the engine and unfortunately there weren’t any window seats left on my flight so I couldn’t move around.

As I was the last person on the door was quickly shut and before I had time to even think about it we had begun pushback from the gate. It was a short taxi to the runway and we blasted off for the short flight to Honolulu.

As one might imagine there was no fancy meal or snack for a short flight like this. Passengers had the option of coffee water or juice the third of which is made right in the Hawaiian Islands.

Having an almost completely covered window the views I experienced weren’t the easiest to obtain but I still had some stuff to see out of the window. We passed by the island of Moloka’i where I had completed my unique connection series just days before.

Before I had even realized it we began our descent into Honolulu. It was not a very long flight and I spent the remaining time looking out at the view I did have.

As we got closer to O’ahu Honolulu came into view and so did more wonderful scenery. As you can tell I mention the scenery a lot and for a good reason as the scenery is one of the biggest draws for those visiting the islands and I didn’t want to miss a single second of it.

For this same reason there is no inflight entertainment on the airlines Boeing 717’s and why would there be when you can spend the time looking out at the ocean and the islands. Even if you don’t get a window the longest interisland flight they operate has just over 40-minutes of total flight time so you won’t have much time to be bored.

we approached the airport from the southwest and made a hard right bank on approach. This is something I don’t experience often but I have been told that this is a common occurrence for flights into Honolulu especially the interisland ones.

We landed at Hawaii’s busiest airport making the total flight time only 22 minutes. A very short flight making the total flight time just about the same time as it took to board the aircraft. I can only imagine that boarding the Airbus A321s and A330s for this route can take as much as double or three times the actual flight time just to board the aircraft.

While the flight isn’t long it certainly was fun getting to experience the interisland transportation system and the staple of Hawaiian’s interisland operations the Boeing 717 and just how efficient it truly is.

Author Joey Gerardi Joe has always been interested in planes for as long as he can remember. He grew up in Central New York during the early 2000s when US Airways Express turboprops ruled the skies. Being from a non-aviation family made it harder for him to be around planes and would only spend about three hours a month at the airport.

While you can save money by using a third-party site you must keep a lookout for dangerous scams.

Scammers love to bank on the popularity of reputable websites and the story is no different when it comes to online travel agencies such as Booking.com Expedia Skyscanner and Priceline. Tap or click here to find out which brands hackers impersonate the most.

Bottom line: Never let your guard down when booking flights hotels or rental cars through third-party platforms. Fake websites can be hard to spot. The best way to avoid common travel scams in 2022 is to prepare yourself before departure. Scroll down for the biggest red flags.

1. Your “airline” demands you pay to rebook a flight

Say you miss your flight. After a quick internet search you find your airline’s official website. You head to the airline’s customer service section and call them up. You’re asked for your personal and payment information to rebook a flight. Once you fork over the cash you try to confirm your booking.

But when you get to the airport or call the actual airline there’s a chilling realization. Nobody booked you for another flight. In your haste to buy another seat on an airplane you didn’t recognize that you were on a fake site.

RELATED: Before you fill out a CAPTCHA form on a website know a scammer could be behind it

Most airlines will rebook you for free on the next flight to your destination. This is only true if the flight has available spaces however.

If there are complications you may need to pay a change or cancellation fee. Luckily many airlines waived those fees due to Covid-19 throwing a wrench into everyone’s travel plans.

2. Flight and airline scams often try to “confirm your information”

Scammers often trick you after booking a flight through a website. Once you pay the so-called “company” calls you to verify your personal and financial information. A legitimate company would never do this so it’s probably a scammer on the other line.

If you’ve already fallen for this scheme or a similar one we get it. Scam and fraudulent calls are at an all-time high and there are no signs of stopping. Tap or click here for three steps you should take after falling for a scam.

3. You get a weird confirmation email

Here’s another red flag to look out for. Say you book a flight and receive a confirmation email. So far so good. There’s just one problem: There’s no ticket.

Authentic confirmation emails always include your ticket information. If it’s missing from your confirmation message you’re not dealing with the actual airline. You’re looking at a phishing email.

SPEAKING OF WHICH … New phishing scams targeting your bank account

4. You see an ad on social media for free tickets

Kim always says “If it’s too good to be true it probably is.” Remember this when you see a Facebook post that claims you can get airline tickets if you reply. It’s one of the most extensive scams swirling around the internet right now.

A recent Facebook post from a group called Southwest Air Fans went viral. It wasn’t the real deal though — it was a fake group made by scammers.

Take a look at this screenshot. Would YOU fall for this?

So many people fell for it that the authentic Southwest Airlines put out a statement. In its scam alert post Southwest Airlines said this deal was not real. “For the record we’re celebrating our 51st anniversary this year not our 69th” the statement said. A cheeky winking emoji followed the statement.

This is just one example of the many fake ads you’ll find on social media. Always double-check the account behind advertisements like this. Look for the blue checkmark next to the account name which lets you know that the account is genuine.

5. You get emails and texts about bargains ticket giveaways gift cards and bonus flight hours

Scammers often try to reel you in with the promise of saving a buck. They capitalize on your desire to keep more money in your pocket. That’s why they’ll create phishing scams saying you won a giveaway or a gift card.

Sure sometimes you do luck out and win a contest. But only if you applied to it through the airline’s official website. Don’t click links in unsolicited emails or text messages without verifying they’re coming from legitimate sources. Also check the URL to make sure it starts with HTTPS:// and is secure.

Lastly be careful when filling out surveys. Scams like this often urge you to enter personal information into phishing sites. They might also ask you to download invoices that are full of malware.

Follow these tips to spot flight and airline scams

You can never be too careful. Here are some reminders that can protect you from travel scams and beyond:

Watch out for deals that seem too good to be true and overly intrusive surveys.

Make sure your confirmation emails include tickets.

Be wary of any “confirmation calls.” If the person on the other end of the line says they need to double-check your private data that’s a surefire sign you’re dealing with a scammer.

Typos and sloppy errors are major red flags.

Look for documentation on canceling or modifying your flights and confirm them before booking. For example check out the policies at Kiwi.com. It offers different types of refunds depending on your ticket type.

Wade corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees — and in some cases their dependents — seeking abortions in states that outlaw the procedure.

The court's decision to roll back the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling which protected the federal constitutional right to an abortion is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America leaving abortion policy up to individual states and paving the way for numerous states to pass new abortion restrictions. As of Friday afternoon state officials in at least seven states said that new abortion bans can now be enforced.

Millions of people seeking abortions could soon be forced to travel across state lines to access the procedure adding to the cost of an already often expensive healthcare service. For many employers' benefit packages may be the only way they can afford an abortion.

In response corporations some with headquarters or offices in Republican-controlled states are taking action. Companies such as Citigroup Salesforce and Match Group first promised financial support to employees seeking abortions in affected states after a draft version of the opinion leaked in May. Many more followed suit on Friday. Some including Bumble and Lyft also previously said they would donate to organizations that support women's rights such as Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice.

Corporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent and worry about the impact these states' anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.

Here are some of the prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.

Microsoft

Microsoft extended its financial support for ""critical healthcare"" including abortions and gender-affirming care to include coverage for travel expenses for such services after the draft opinion overturning Roe was first leaked.

Apple

The company's existing benefits package allows employees to travel out of state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state according to an Apple spokesperson.

Meta

The tech giant intends to offer travel expense reimbursement ""to the extent permitted by law"" for employees seeking out-of-state health care and reproductive services according to a spokesperson. ""We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved"" the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

Yelp

Yelp's existing healthcare plan for U.S. employees pays for women family members and partners to travel out of states with strict abortion laws such as Texas and Oklahoma which ban abortions after 6 weeks.

""This ruling puts women's health in jeopardy denies them their human rights and threatens to dismantle the progress we've made toward gender equality in the workplaces since Roe"" Jeremy Stoppelman co-founder of Yelp said in a statement Friday. ""Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.""

Disney

Disney employees who are unable to access medical care in one location will be given affordable coverage to access the same care in another location according to a company spokesperson. The benefit covers family planning and pregnancy-related decisions.

Uber

Uber's U.S. insurance plans already cover reproductive health benefits including abortion and travel expenses to access healthcare. The rideshare company will also reimburse any drivers sued under state law for providing transportation to a clinic through the app according to an Uber spokesperson.

Netflix

The streaming company offers travel reimbursement coverage for U.S. full-time employees and their dependents who need to travel for healthcare treatments including abortions and gender-affirming care a Netflix spokesperson told CNN. The company provides a lifetime allowance of $10000 per employee (or their dependents) per service.

Bumble

Bumble a female-driven dating app said Friday that it will support its employees' ability to access ""the healthcare services they need"" including abortion care. A Bumble spokesperson added that the company will donate to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

""Abortion is healthcare and healthcare is a human right. We are deeply troubled by the Supreme Court decision"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Match Group

Dating app company Match Group in October established a partnership with Planned Parenthood Los Angeles to provide abortion access for its Texas employees and their dependents. The company is currently considering expanding that benefit to all its U.S. staff including remote employees in states with trigger laws that may soon ban abortions according to a Match spokesperson. Match healthcare plans also help to cover travel and lodging costs for employees who need to travel to receive care the spokesperson said.

Box.com

Box.com will cover employee travel and medical expenses incurred by employees while seeking reproductive services.

Levi Strauss

The denim company said through The Levi Strauss Foundation that it is providing grants to the Center for Reproductive Rights Afiya Center and ARC-Southeast which provides direct assistance to women and communities in need of care. The company previously said that under its benefits plan employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren't included in the company's benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement it said.

Comcast-NBC Universal

Comcast has an existing healthcare travel benefit for all employees that covers up to $4000 per trip up to three trips per year with a maximum coverage cap of $10000 per year. The amount paid out depends on the type of health care procedure but abortion care is covered according to the company.

Warner Bros Discovery

Warner Brothers Discovery which owns CNN on Friday expanded healthcare benefits options to include expenses for employees and their covered family members who need to travel to access abortions and other reproductive care according to a company spokesperson.

Condé Nast

The media company said Friday it will reimburse travel and lodging for employees who need abortion infertility or gender-reaffirming services and cannot obtain them locally. CEO Roger Lynch said in an internal memo the Supreme Court decision was a ""crushing blow to reproductive rights"" and said the most powerful way the company can respond is through its content and journalism.

JPMorgan Chase

Starbucks

The coffee company is providing employees enrolled in its healthcare plan a medical travel benefit to access an abortion according to a public letter to employees by Sara Kelly Starbucks acting executive vice president of partner resources.

""We all need to process this in our own way and as you do here is what I want you to know: no matter where you live or what you believe we will always ensure you have access to quality healthcare"" Kelly said in the letter.

Dick's Sporting Goods

For employees who live in a state that restricts abortion access Dick's will provide up to $4000 in travel expense reimbursement to travel to the nearest location where care is legally available the company said in a statement Friday. The benefit will be provided to any employee spouse or dependent enrolled in its medical plan along with one support person.

Kroger

The grocer's healthcare package includes travel benefits of up to $4000 to facilitate access for reproductive healthcare services including abortion and fertility treatments according to a Kroger spokesperson.

Alaska Airlines

Alaska Airlines said in a statement that it has always provided travel reimbursements for ""certain medical procedures and treatments if they are not available where you live.""

""Today's Supreme Court decision does not change that"" it said.

Workers say they want consistent schedules and higher wages from a company generating billions of dollars each year. Amazon workers in Bellmawr New Jersey walked off the job citing broken promises following the company’s decision to close a facility and relocate up to 90% of workers to faraway facilities on short notice.

Workers at these mega-corporations aren’t the only ones standing up for themselves.

At Korshak Bagels Good Karma Cafe and the Canopy by Hilton Philadelphia workers have also formed unions in recent months. The unions at each demand a say in COVID-19 safety policies wages and benefits. Across the city workers in industries that until recently seemed nearly impossible to organize are showing that there’s nowhere they can’t win.

For those familiar with Philadelphia’s rich history of labor militancy recent activism from baristas and warehouse workers may not be a surprise. In the early years of the republic Philadelphia was the beating heart of the American labor movement."

But after a controversial school mask order prompted the county board of commissioners to split and advertise her dual position earlier this year Mercatante's final day was Wednesday.

Two individuals have been hired to replace her formerly dual role as medical director and public health officer.

“I just want people to know that this wasn’t a voluntary retirement. I get a lot of people going ‘Congratulations on your retirement’ and it’s the last thing in the world I wanted to do is leave this staff and public health at this point. It’s with a really heavy heart that I’m leaving” she said during an interview.

County board members took issue with Mercatante and what they alleged had been a communication problem with the rollout of the temporary K-12 mask mandate in January. In February they broke her job into two.

Mercatante has been vocal about considering the move a termination.

This week other health department officials joined her in looking back on what they said had been a painful few months bracing for her departure.

When asked Mercatante and others pointed to their work with community health needs assessments combating Hepatitis A widespread promotion of vaccinations combating diversity and health equity issues and increasing the agency’s public role and place on community boards as their biggest steps forward under her leadership.

Mercatante said she wishes she could’ve done more in studying adverse childhood experiences as an indicator that trauma early in life translates to health issues as adults.

“This is part of my sadness in leaving” she said. However she said it would resurface as a core component of local community health improvement plans particularly with the trauma emerging from the pandemic.

New health officer ‘is good leadership’ administrator says

Mercatante’s exit means the St. Clair County Health Department staff must prepare to work under new health officer Liz King who was promoted to the role June 16. King was formerly the health department’s nursing and community health director.

Greg Brown the department’s administrator was among those who expressed confidence in King's appointment.

“Ultimately we’ll be fine” he said. “Liz is good leadership.”

Mercatante agreed.

“I think Liz is going to be a great leader” Mercatante said. “I think our health department is strong. Public health is as strong as ever. It’s not going to go away because I’m gone. This is much bigger than me.""

In a statement King addressed on Mercatante's departure.

“It is said that the greatest leaders do not ‘manage’ but ‘lead’ allowing other team members autonomy to grow and learn” King said. “She was a master at this and it has made all the difference to those on her administrative team.”

Brown: Model with part-time physician access is ‘going backwards’

Unlike the public health officer whose administrative role is full time the medical director in local health agencies is a part-time role with at least 16 hours a week required by statute.

It’s a difficult opening to fill officials have said particularly in a rural area.

The individual who was offered the role Dr. Najibah Rehman is serving temporarily after County Administrator Karry Hepting said Rehman accepted a different position.

“It’s hard to take on any new initiatives until we have some solid path with leadership” Brown said.

The medical director helps build and maintain services and signs standing orders for nurses. There is concern a temporary appointment will stymie the pursuit of grants and jeopardize community relationships.

Brown said one area of concern is the health department's teen health center. That's where Mercatante first got her start in public health before becoming medical director.

Mercatante and Brown said teens at the Port Huron facility may be also losing more direct access to a physician and face a higher reliance on referrals.

“We’re going to lose a lot of medical support. Also family planning. It’s going to be a loss” Brown said Tuesday. “I think we’re going backwards with changes in the model. Back to a health officer and medical director being separate.”

Local officials reflect on Mercatante's community impact

Justin Westmiller the county’s emergency management director worked closely with health officials during the rise of the coronavirus.

Although he didn’t think Mercatante's exit would alter that partnership he said she made decisions that “put her career at risk” and held “true to her medical beliefs” going “above and beyond what a normal public servant might think they’re required to do.”

Port Huron City Manager James Freed the only public official to reference Mercatante during a State of the County address in March said they disagreed on “a lot of things” throughout COVID but that he gained “candid truthful and honest” insight to make decisions and that he appreciated peers like her because they “do not tell me what I want to hear.”

Public information officer Alyse Nichols said it was unique that they were able to share a physician’s expertise with weekly Facebook Live chats earlier in the pandemic.

“To be so transparent with the public and show all that empathy and say when she didn’t know that is something special” she said.

“She’s always been approachable and transparent with staff as well” Rebecca Campau a nursing supervisor said.

“I’ve been here 27 years from past leadership to current” said Jennifer Michaluk director of health education and planning turning her attention to Mercatante. ""You saw where there were gaps where we were not a presence at the table but you said we have to be present. We are public health we need to be at this table our voice matters because you always saw things from the population level versus the narrow view. That made just a tremendous impact.”

Nichols said Mercatante also kept “an eye on partnerships” adding “I mean the effort she put in making sure she made those partnerships for our Black and brown community. I have not seen that in my leaders working in local government or at the state level.”

On the latter Mercatante helped spearhead special community clinics on Port Huron's south side citing a lack of access to the COVID vaccine for some minority populations.

Keeping momentum up through COVID and beyond after an emotional turn

Diane Lois the county's emergency response coordinator said Mercatante's presence has helped set the department up to share their expertise at large with other agencies.

Now they hope to keep that momentum going.

However Lois said they’re still dealing with the emotional impact of Mercatante's departure.

“When this happened Dr. Merc it was a major kick in the gut. It affected everybody here. It’s like ‘What do you mean?’"" Lois said. ""It was saying she was going to suffer for what all of us have done so proudly worked so hard (at). We believe in it we know what’s going on we understand why we’re doing what we’re doing … There’s so much people don’t know on the outside about us and what we do. It was a punishment for doing our job.”

Mercatante said she doesn't intend to retire as she waits for her a new opportunity to become official.

“I haven’t signed on the dotted line. I’m hoping to continue my role in public health at the state level” she said. “... I think I still have a lot to offer. Certainly I wish I could offer it to our local community. But having been — and I’ll say it again — forced out I feel like I want to use my skill set until I’m ready to retire. That’s my goal.”

Here's how to choose the right one for you,"Are you finally ready to disconnect from your wireless plan for something new?

There are several reasons you may be rethinking your cellphone or smartphone plans. Perhaps you want something more affordable an increasingly important factor as inflation maintains its grip on the economy.

Maybe you are having a bad experience with your current wireless carrier or the connection with your carrier's network is not compatible with where you live.

As competition in the wireless space increases so do the benefits and perks you receive when you sign up for a plan. T-Mobile recently introduced several new perks for unlimited customers such as a 25-cent-a-gallon discount on gas at Shell stations and free connectivity and streaming on flights.

Let's break down the choices you have when selecting a wireless phone plan.

Online hate:These are the people targeted by online hate on Facebook Instagram and Twitter

Tight on cash? This tech offers the best bang for your buck.

AT&T

What are my plan options? Plans with one line start at $50 gradually increasing if you want more available data. Plans also vary depending on how many lines you want. So AT&T's best unlimited plan costs $85 for one line; but if you have four people on one plan it's $50 per line.

What perks can I get? All of AT&T's Unlimited plans support 5G and include unlimited talk and text as well as the carrier's ActiveArmor mobile security app to protect your phone from spam calls or when you connect to an open Wi-Fi network.

On its highest plan Unlimited Premium users get unlimited data up to 50 GB of data if you want to use a phone as a mobile hot spot to hop online with a laptop or other device and 4K streaming. Some of those perks diminish or disappear if you drop to a cheaper plan. For example AT&T's plan below Unlimited Premium offers less hot spot data and standard-definition streaming.

T-Mobile

What are my plan options? The carrier's most affordable plan is $45 a month and offers essentials including 20 GB of data unlimited 3G mobile hotspot data and a free year of Paramount+. Like AT&T plans will vary based on how much data you want and the number of phones included. T-Mobile's top plan for one line costs $85 a month ($90 if you don't use autopay).

What perks can I get? On the top-tier Magenta Max plan customers get a Netflix basic plan for free along with a free year of Apple TV+ and Paramount+ streaming services. There's also unlimited data talk and text as well as up to 40 GB of data if you use your phone as a mobile hot spot. You can also text and use Wi-Fi on flights. Some perks like free Netflix drop off if you go to a lower plan.

Verizon Wireless

What are my plan options? Verizon is the priciest of the big three; its lowest plan starts at $70 a month for one line all the way to $100 a month for its top plan depending on data needs and the number of lines. Verizon's plans have unlimited plans with perks for entertainment-focused users plus a top-tier ""Get More"" plan that combines both.

What perks can I get? On the ""Get More"" plan you get unlimited data and 50 GB of mobile hot spot data. If you already subscribe to Verizon's internet service you can also get a discount. As part of the plan you get a free subscription to the Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+ bundle a TravelPass to use your phone internationally as well as a choice between Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass. If you're on an iPhone you also get a subscription to Apple Music. Perks vary if you go to a lower-tier plan. For example the ""Do More"" plan aimed at travelers includes the TravelPass but none of the streaming options (you can get them free for a six-month period).

What about budget carriers?

You don't have to stick with the big three carriers if you're seeking a plan at a reasonable price. For example Mint Mobile is offering an unlimited plan for $15 a month which includes 35 GB of 5G data before flipping to 4G along with unlimited talk and text. The one catch? You have to sign up for three months at a time at minimum.

Metro by T-Mobile offers its top-tier Unlimited plan for $60 a month and includes unlimited data access to T-Mobile's 5G network 15 GB of hot spot data and an Amazon Prime membership.

Visible by Verizon has its own Unlimited plan starting at $40 a month with unlimited talk texting and data and unlimited hot spot use.

Other carriers including Cricket Wireless and Consumer Cellular provide similar budget plans.

What Unlimited really means

You may notice phone plans referencing premium data or premium networks. No your phone won't pull data from a special luxury network. It's basically data the carriers won't slow down due to congestion.

On most top-tier plans you really do get unlimited data. But for those mid-tier plans that show a set amount of premium data once you cross that threshold you may see slower speeds due to congestion on your next bill.

How to choose the right wireless plan?

Figure how you plan to use your phone. The most important factor you should consider is what you want from this new plan. Are you looking to save money? Do you want to use your phone as a hot spot more often? Do you need this phone only for the basics like texting and calls? Once you nail down how you want to use your phone you can decide which plan best matches your needs.

Premium data limits? Wi-Fi is your friend. If you are considering a plan with premium data limits make sure you have several good safe spots for Wi-Fi so you can avoid hitting them each month.

Watch for extra incentives like autopay. Most carriers will provide a discount if you decide to enable autopay which means the carrier will automatically take your payment from a checking account debit card or credit card. Just make sure you read the fine print before committing to autopay.

Double-check fees (and benefits) for switching. Carriers usually will hit you with an early-termination fee if you're under contract on their plan. On top of that if you financed a phone you would have to also pay off any remaining balance if you plan to keep it. Check carefully how much it might cost to leave early before you move to a new service.

However you may find discounts from carriers if you're a new customer switching services. For example T-Mobile has offers to pay off balances at your previous carrier to cover any fees.

Check for special discounts. You might be able to save money on your plan depending on whether you work if you are a student or a member of the military or first responder.

Difficulty Easy Duration 10 minutes What You Need Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 phone

Most recent software update

Of course as state of the art as the Z Fold 3 is it may not be entirely free of teething problems and technical hitches. Fortunately we've put together a list of common Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 problems and how to fix them. This details everything from battery drain issues to problems with Samsung Pay helping you to make the most of your new phone without letting minor snags spoil your enjoyment of it. As is the case with our problem-solving pieces this article will be updated as we encounter new common problems so please check back if an issue you're experiencing isn't currently covered.

Issue: Various problems following Android 12 update

Following December’s Android 12 update many Galaxy Z Fold 3 (and Z Flip 3) users on South Korea’s Samsung Forums reported a range of issues from screen flickering and slow performance to the Dual Messenger feature not working devices entering recovery mode following the installation of Android 12 and even being unable to take screenshots or use the camera.

Solution

As a result of these issues Samsung temporarily stopped the Android 12 rollout for the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 resuming it shortly afterward following critical bug fixes. If you haven’t yet updated your Z Fold 3 to Android 12 it should now be safe to do so. If you’re still experiencing any of the issues you first noticed after installing Android 12 ensure your phone has the latest update. Should these issues persist we recommend contacting Samsung for support.

Issue: Connectivity issues after Android 12 update

Some Galaxy Z Fold 3 users on Reddit have been complaining of connectivity issues following updating to Android 12. Although this is affecting phones on other networks too T-Mobile customers seem to be the worst affected with many complaining of losing cell signal and being unable to send or receive texts or make or receive calls. T-Mobile is aware of the issue and is working on a fix but it’s not clear yet whether the hardware is involved.

Solution

If this is happening to you T-Mobile recommends contacting your local retail store for support or to exchange your device for a new handset. You’ll be able to exchange even if you’re out of the usual 14-day return period.

Issue: Camera app not displaying Dual Screen button for selfies

A number of users on Samsung’s Community forum have noted that when trying to take a selfie in the Camera app they don’t see the Dual Screen button. This is normally situated in the top-right of the main (folding) screen and allows the user to see a preview of their selfie on the cover screen as well allowing them to take a selfie with the more powerful rear camera. However on occasion you may notice that it isn’t there for you to tap.

Solution

Fortunately there’s a very quick fix for this. As other Samsung Community users have noted opening the Camera app from the cover screen (rather than the main screen) will ensure that the Dual Screen button appears where it should.

Issue: Samsung Pay not working

This seems to be a semi-regular theme among recent Samsung phones and the Galaxy Fold 3 appears to continue this tradition. Namely it has a problem with Samsung Pay at least if you’re in the U.K. (and a few other European nations). According to more than one Samsung Community user the Samsung Pay app doesn’t work for them confusingly displaying a message in German and preventing them from proceeding further when setting up. This issue also appears to be affecting the Z Flip 3 in more or less equal measure.

As with previous instances of this issue the problem arises from a mixup in the CSC code with which the phone is originally set up. Devices running EUX (EU software) instead of EUA (U.K. software) will be able to set up in English but Samsung Pay will operate in German which is obviously less than ideal for most people residing in the U.K.

Samsung moderators have suggested a number of possible fixes for this problem although some users report that it doesn’t work for them. Samsung also issued updates at the end of last year designed to fix this issue.

Possible solutions

Restart your Z Fold 3.

Go to Settings and check for software updates. Download and install any available system updates and/or Samsung Pay updates.

If this doesn't solve the issue try turning off Wi-Fi and then turning it on again.

You could also try uninstalling and reinstalling Samsung Pay.

It’s likely that Samsung will get around to addressing this issue via an update of some kind as it did with the Galaxy S21. However for now you may be stuck with it if the above tips don’t work.

Issue: Screen protector problems

Some users of the Z Fold 3 have encountered a variety of issues with the phone’s pre-installed screen protectors. These problems aren’t always exactly the same with some reporting bubbles and others reporting inconsistencies in the protector’s adherence to the screen.

As annoying as such niggles may be it’s strongly advised that you don’t remove the pre-installed screen protector yourself particularly when it comes to the main foldable screen. Instead you should contact Samsung as soon as possible to arrange a fix or a replacement.

On the other hand at least one user has asked whether it’s safe to remove the outer film that comes wrapped around the phone out of the box. This is indeed safe.

Bug: Unable to acquire GPS location in apps

Some users have complained that apps they use are unable to receive their GPS location data from the phone.

Possible solutions

One Samsung Community user suggests clearing the cache and data of the apps unable to receive GPS data. Simply go to Settings > Apps > [App] > Storage > Clear cache and data. It may also be worth double-checking permissions for each affected app just in case they don’t have the authorization to receive your location.

This is an issue that has affected other Samsung devices in recent years so you may simply have to wait for a software update for a fix. You can check if one is available by doing the following. Open the Settings app on your device. Scroll down to Software update. Select Download and install. If a new update is available your device will obtain it.

Issue: Can’t activate unlocked Z Fold 3 on Sprint

This is one of the more complicated and difficult problems encountered so far with the Galaxy Z Fold 3. Quite a large number of United States-based users have reported that they can’t activate their phones on Sprint. This seems to be an issue arising from T-Mobile’s merger with Sprint and from how Samsung has optimized the phone (or not) for using a T-Mobile or Sprint SIM card.

As of writing the only fix appears to be contacting T-Mobile and/or Sprint to activate your handset and trying a different SIM card (i.e. a T-Mobile rather than Sprint SIM). That said some users have reported that the issue was resolved after several days with a few noting that they were eventually able to activate their phones via either the T-Mobile or Sprint websites.

Problem: Battery draining too fast

The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is a demanding phone given its folding main screen and additional cover screen. You’d therefore expect it to eat through battery life fairly quickly. However some users are griping that it’s running down its battery more quickly than it arguably should particularly when they use the phone’s 120Hz refresh rate (which is available for both screens).

Workarounds

This is a fairly common problem for most phones although in the case of the Z Fold 3 you may want to try turning it down to a 60Hz refresh rate which will improve your battery’s day-to-day longevity. Otherwise there are a number of other workarounds you can try to increase your time between charges.

Turn on Protect Battery as recommended by certain users. This can be done by going to Settings > Battery and device care > More battery > Settings > Protect battery.

It’s also worth turning on battery optimization. You can do this by going to Settings > Battery and device care > Battery > Power mode > Optimized. Also activate Adaptive power saving on the same screen.

You can get rid of demanding apps or at least limit your use of them. You can check which apps are consuming the most battery power by going to Settings > Battery and device care > Battery > Battery usage.

You could also try resetting your app preferences. Go to Settings > Apps > More > Reset app preferences.

Try disabling scanning for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Go to Settings > Location > Improve accuracy > Disable Wi-Fi scanning. Then select Disable Wi-Fi scanning.

You can switch off background data and activity for less-important apps. You can do this by going to Settings > Apps *> [App] > *Mobile data > Allow background data usage > Off. Then do the same again but after picking an app go to Battery> Allow background activity > Off.

Or you could try disabling notifications for apps. First tap and hold the icon of an app you’d like to disable notifications for and then tap App info > Notifications > Show notifications > Off.

Try turning on adaptive brightness for your display. Go to Settings > Display > Adaptive brightness.

Or try checking your settings thoroughly for any other feature that may be working in the background that may be unnecessary. For example certain apps check location data which you can switch off by going to Settings > Privacy > Permission manager > Location.

Finally you could try wiping the phone’s cache partition via recovery mode. Switch off the phone then press and hold the Power + Volume up buttons. Release them when you see the Samsung logo. Then use the Volume buttons to scroll through the options until you reach Wipe cache partition which you can select by pressing the Power button.

Problem: Z Fold 3 randomly rebooting

This is a rarer problem although it has been noted to also affect the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra. Basically the Z Fold 3 randomly restarts without warning with one user noting it happens multiple times.

Possible solutions

While this issue seems to affect only a very small minority of devices there appears to be no clear fix for it at the moment. That said there are two things worth trying:

Start the phone in Safe Mode (hold the Power button and when the Samsung logo appears press and hold the Volume down button until the Safe mode option appears). This restricts your phone to use only native apps so if you find that your phone doesn’t restart randomly this suggests that a third-party app is causing the problem. Accordingly delete all of these apps and then add the most important ones back one by one making sure to confirm that none of them reintroduces the problem.

You could also try wiping the Z Fold 3’s cache partition. Boot up the phone in recovery mode by holding the Power + Volume up buttons when the device is switched off. Then select Wipe cache partition.

New York CNN Business —

All things considered video game leader Electronic Arts is having a pretty decent year despite inflation worries recession fears and other macroeconomic headwinds. Shares of EA (EA) are only down about 2% in 2022 a drop that’s not nearly as bad as the rest of the tech sector which is now in bear market territory.

But there are concerns about EA’s future as the gaming industry consolidates.

Xbox owner Microsoft (MSFT) is in the process of buying Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Grand Theft Auto maker Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) has already scooped up mobile game developer Zynga.

Will EA be able to remain independent as its peers continue to grow? There’s also growing competition from the likes of metaverse mobile gaming company Roblox and Fortnite maker Epic. Even Netflix (NFLX) has thrown its hat into the gaming arena.

EA has a lot of lucrative franchises such as the long-running Madden NFL games a popular soccer series (that will soon lose the FIFA branding) Apex Legends and several games tied to the Star Wars universe.

And there has been a lot of chatter about EA being a good takeover target for deep-pocketed tech and media firms such as Apple (AAPL) Disney (DIS) Comcast (CMCSA) or Amazon (AMZN).

So will EA finally get bought? The company was not immediately available for comment.

But EA has been acquisitive in its own right and could be looking for further deals particularly ones that could bolster its mobile gaming division. EA made two such acquisitions in 2021 Glu for $2.4 billion and Playdemic (formerly owned by previous CNN parent AT&T (T)) for $1.4 billion.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that there’s about a 15% probability that EA could itself be acquired “given heightened levels of M&A activity within the video game space” according to a recent report about the broader tech sector. It’s a small chance to be sure but it’s bigger than zero.

The analysts came up with a potential takeover valuation of $190 a share which is “consistent with recent video game transactions.” That’s nearly 50% above EA’s current stock price.

Still EA has enough quality content to justify going it alone for the foreseeable future.

Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald noted in a report after EA’s latest earnings came out in May that a “solid pipeline” (more games from EA Sports plus updates to The Sims Lord of the Rings and Bioware franchises) as well as “accelerating mobile growth” were positives for the stock.

So EA may not need to sell itself to a larger company to remain competitive in the video game world.

Earnings from Nike and Walgreens on tap

There is a definite lull in “earnings season.” Most major companies will report second quarter results in mid-July. But some notable companies including two Dow components are on tap to release results this week.

Nike (NKE) will report its earnings after the closing bell Monday. Shares of the sneaker and athletic apparel giant are down nearly 35% this year.

The company reported solid results in March but geopolitical worries have weighed on Nike’s stock. Analysts are predicting that Nike will post a decline in sales and earnings per share for the quarter. Nike also just announced it’s exiting Russia in light of the invasion of Ukraine.

Walgreens (WBA) will also report results before the market opens on Thursday. Shares are down 20% this year double the 10% drop for rival CVS (CVS) but not as bad as the nearly 45% plunge for Rite Aid (RAD).

It’s been a challenging second year for Walgreens CEO Rosalind Brewer who took the top job in March 2021.

The veteran executive who had previous leadership roles at Walmart (WMT) and Starbucks (SBUX) is dealing with supply chain disruptions and concerns about a slowdown in the economy and weakening consumer demand — a problem facing all retailers. Wall Street is predicting that revenue and net income will fall from a year ago.

But not many people know that they also have a sports car team.

The famous video game company’s Scottish branch Rockstar North is the creator of the Grand Theft Auto series. The employees working at that branch are also sports car racing enthusiasts. So they came up with a sports car team Viken Motorsport.

Moreover the cars they use for the events have stickers of the parody brands from the Grand Theft Auto game series. So Rockstar Games may be backing this project like they are with the music label CircoLoco Records and cycling team RockstarGames Racing.

These Rockstar employees work on their sports car team during whatever time they find after their work. Moreover they recently participated in the 24h Nürburgring race where they came first in their class while 72nd out of 135 racers on May 29.

Rockstar Games might be working on a GTA 6

Grand Theft Auto is one of the most famous video game series and an absolute fan favorite. The Grand Theft Auto V is the latest installment in the series that came out in 2013. It’s been over nine years since then but it is still one of the most popular games selling over 155 million copies.

However the other question that everyone has kept guessing is when the next GTA is coming. There were a lot of doubts about the GTA 6. So the Rockstar games ended those doubts with a blog revealing ongoing developments on a new entry to the series.

Moreover the Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick also talked about the developers working on a new Grand Theft Auto game. Take-Two Interactive is the parent company of Rockstar Games and 2K games. Recently Zelnick attended Jordan Wasserberger’s Excelsior podcast.

In the 27-minute-long podcast Wasserberger questioned “As a long-time fan of the series avid gamer in general I feel obligated to ask Is there anything you could tell us about GTA 6?” The Take-Two boss answered “Sure I mean Rockstar said that there is another version coming. So stay tuned.”

EA is reportedly revealing Skate Need for Speed and FIFA 23 in July. The date of the reveals is unclear but in due time we will know.

Huge reveals from EA in July

Skate Return

We previously reported a rumor that Skate was going to be shown next month. Since the reveal of Skate in 2020 it has been relatively quiet. The most recent reveal of Skate has leaked gameplay footage showcasing the signature low cam of the Skate franchise. However we know no details concerning the direction of the story skaters involved multiplayer and more.

FIFA 23

FIFA 23 will be the last installment of the FIFA franchise. Electronic Arts is moving in another direction with the future of soccer simulation. EA announced EA Sports FC as the future of interactive football. On the bright side it will contain numerous features that FIFA fans know and love.

Until then EA is looking to go out with a bang with FIFA 23. EA stated that FIFA 23 will be the most expansive one yet.

Need for Speed

Perhaps the most ambiguous of the three titles is Need for Speed. EA has been quiet with details of the new Need for Speed title. The only thing we can confirm is that EA brought out the big guns to develop the title. We reported that Codemasters merged with Criterion to secure the future of Need For Speed.

Needless to say as we know more we will report it. Which of the three titles are you excited about the most. Let us know in the comments.

Cadaweng belongs to a group of weavers trying their hands at producing woven art for a project called “Art Weave” which features handwoven tapestries that interpret nine paintings being exhibited at this year’s crafts show “Mandeko Kito” (Ibaloy for ‘Let’s sell’).

ADVERTISEMENT

In a video documentation Cadaweng admitted being a little apprehensive about producing a companion tapestry for Galang’s piece which has snake-like terra cotta heads leaping off the canvas. With the help of fellow weaver Leticia Bacolong Cadaweng’s “translation” was a brown woven textile embossed with cartoon-like brown heads attached to elongated necks.

Intricate tapestry

Near her exhibit loomed a giant blue canvas with a stark three-dimensional orange tree made of beads. This mixed-media painting by Julius Lumiqued was matched with a warm blue ikat shawl with its own orange beadwork that was produced by weaver Jane Kis-ing.

Maria Rosalina Wanget originally from Tadian town in Mountain Province said she used to produce home decor. Her companion piece to a multicolored and multilayered portrait of a Cordillera house by Hermie Bruno was a comparatively intricate tapestry of a traditional mountain abode.

‘Simple rudimentary’

The fusion of weaving and contemporary art in the exhibition was the brainchild of fashion designer Twinkle Ferraren who believed it would open a new market for struggling weavers said John Arvin Molintas who serves as the executive director of the Baguio Arts and Crafts Collective Inc. (BACCI).Like many Baguio craftspeople major artists and even performing bands weavers like Cadaweng suffered gravely during the two years of quarantine after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020. Health and travel restrictions barred tourists who were their major customers.

“I have been weaving only for the past two years. I learned [the craft] years ago but I never practiced it seriously. But I decided to pursue the craft and earn a living instead of sitting idly during the pandemic” she said. Cadaweng described her skills as “simple” and rudimentary.

Introducing traditional weavers to more popular forms of art like paintings may inspire them to create new designs for woven textiles Molintas said. Most of their products are indigenous blankets and table tops so Ferraren realized that art expressed through loom and backstrap weaving may attract new customers and increase the value of their work he said.

Digitization process

More importantly sufficient income affords them time to step back and teach genuine Cordillera designs to younger generations Molintas said because Cadaweng Bacolong Kis-ing and participating weavers Antonia Dagoyeng Nora Duculan Rosalina Wanget Jocelyn Olowan Solimen and Catherine Domigyay are inherently “culture bearers.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“The pressure upon Cordilleran weavers is great because they are working to meet the needs of all the different agencies surrounding them and they are also facing the demise of their culture and tradition” according to the book “Cordillera Textiles” the initial output of the University of the Philippines Baguio’s multidisciplinary Cordillera Textiles Research Project (CordiTex).

CordiTex has begun a digitization process to preserve weaving designs thought long extinct but which were discovered in the archives of other countries. These old and forgotten designs are being reintroduced to modern weavers as a way of prolonging the craft.

Network

BACCI was formed after the summer capital became the country’s first city to join the World Creative Cities Network in 2017. The network organized by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization is composed of cities with active creative economies (artists and craftspeople who generate revenues for their respective cities).Baguio was picked for its folk arts and crafts—among them woodcarvers silversmiths and weavers who have supplied Baguio’s souvenir shops since the 1950s.

The supply chain crisis has retailers considering the unthinkable: Instead of returning your unwanted items just keep them.

The chaotic mix of record fuel prices and an unending supply chain crisis have retailers considering the unthinkable: Instead of returning your unwanted items just keep them.

In recent weeks some of the biggest store chains including Target Walmart Gap American Eagle Outfitters and others have reported in their latest earnings calls that they have too much inventory of stuff ranging from workout clothes spring-time jackets and hoodies to garden furniture and bulky kids' toys. It's costing them tons of money to store it.

Now add on to that glut another category of product that stores have to deal with: returns.

So instead of piling returned merchandise onto this growing inventory heap stores are considering just handing customers their money back and letting them hang onto the stuff they don't want.

""It would be a smart strategic initiative"" said Burt Flickinger retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. ""Retailers are stuck with excess inventory of unprecedented levels. They can't afford to take back even more of it.""

Returned products are handled in a number of different ways he said. Retailers take back merchandise from the customer evaluate it and if it's in good condition put it back on the shelf at the same or lesser price.

They can refurbish damaged returns and sell them for less or offload them to liquidators to resell. They also can sell returned products to foreign liquidators for sale in Europe Canada or Mexico.

""Given the situation at the ports and the container shortages sending product overseas isn't really an option"" said Flickinger. Lastly retailers can hire third party firms to handle all aspect of merchandise returns for them.

Each of these options however tack on additional costs for retailers he said.

""For every dollar in sales a retailer's net profit is between a cent to five cents. With returns for every dollar in returned merchandise it costs a retailer between 15 cents to 30 cents to handle it"" said Flickinger.

There is one other option for retailers to address returns while avoiding more product bloat and that's to consider a 'returnless return' said Steve Rop chief operating officer with goTRG a firm that processes over 100 million returned items annually for companies like Wal-Mart Amazon and Lowe's.

Just keep it

Rop said his company's clients are 100% considering offering the ""keep it"" option for returns this year although he wouldn't disclose if any of his customers have implemented the ""Keep it"" returns policy yet.

In some instances when they determine it would be easier some retailers advise customers to just keep or donate their return after issuing a refund. Walmart said it had nothing to share at this time. Lowe's didn't provide a comment for the story.

""They're already discounting in stores to clear out products but when there's heavy discounting buyer's remorse goes up. People are tempted to buy a lot to only return it later"" he said.

Refunding customers while simultaneously letting them keep their returns isn't a new practice said Rop. ""It started with Amazon several years ago"" he said.

The offer makes sense for some types of products -- lower price-tier bulky items like furniture kitchen appliances home decor baby chairs walkers strollers where it's costly for the retailer to cover the shipping cost for the return.

""Other products like kids' toys footwear towels and bedding raise sanitary concerns when it comes to returns. It could also apply to these categories"" he said.

Another concern with cheaper items: Stores typically discount returned products so the amount of money they can make on an inexpensive return is miniscule -- and may not be worth the tradeoff says Keith Daniels partner with Carl Marks Advisors.

Still a ""keep it"" policy has its own disadvantages namely: Companies will need to ensure that they don't become victims of fraud.

""One thing retailers need to track and ensure is that customers that become aware of the (Keep it) policy do not begin to abuse it by seeking free merchandise over a series of orders by getting a refund but getting to keep the merchandise"" said Daniels.

The interview also covered the company’s climate ambitions putting a flashy coat of paint on an organization that is the world’s fifth-largest historical polluter and has pushed climate denial at a high level for half a century.

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods sat down with CNBC’s David Faber for a long interview about climate change. The full interview is 35 minutes long (on top of a previous hour-long interview) and mostly discusses climate change and Exxon’s carbon capture and storage desires.

The interview sounds at first glance surprisingly reasonable and candid. Woods does not deny the scientific reality of climate change calls for carbon reductions and a higher global carbon price and recognizes that electric cars are coming.

But in view of Exxon’s history Woods looks more like a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

No new gas cars by 2040

Of particular note is that he seems to think that sales of new gas-powered passenger vehicles will end in 2040 globally – before even many governments do. Some governments have set a target earlier than that – for example 2035 in California and Europe (some European countries will go even earlier); 2030(-ish) in Washington; and the gold standard 2025 in Norway. But there are others that have either set no target or that have set later targets like China’s and Japan’s 2035 targets that still allow gas cars and the US which currently has no target but the earliest nationwide proposal is for 2045.

We’ve written before about how many of these targets will likely be exceeded (and also why post-2035 ambitions are pathetic) but the notion that Exxon also sees these targets being exceeded is quite interesting. Particularly given that not long ago Saudi Aramco the world’s largest oil company said that it expects 90% of vehicles to still be driven by internal combustion engines in “mid-century” and industry analyst IHS Markit thinks only 30% of new cars in “key automotive markets” (i.e. not globally) will be electric in 2040.

So Exxon is a big outlier here and is predicting a much earlier end to gas vehicles than most other groups.

However Woods still claimed this isn’t a threat to Exxon’s business. He said that even if all new cars were electric by 2040 that would only drop oil demand back down to 2013-2014 levels by Exxon’s calculations. Since the company was profitable then he sees a future where it can remain profitable even with that level of demand.

A much larger part of the interview is devoted to Exxon’s plans for carbon capture which it is clear that Woods sees as a potential future revenue stream that Exxon can leverage.

Carbon Capture as another revenue stream

Woods paints a rosy picture of Exxon’s potential for contribution but it’s easy to see the dollar signs in his eyes while he does so.

He claimed that Exxon is responsible for more carbon capture than any other company in the world (by capturing CO2 from its facilities “some” of which it stores and the rest which it uses in operations…to help drill for more oil) and he thinks that Exxon can be a leader in “direct air capture” in the future.

Direct air capture is the idea that carbon can be taken directly out of the air and then sequestered in some way to make sure it stays out of the atmosphere. Environmentalists have questioned whether it is a valuable goal or if it risks delaying climate action or simply works to serve oil industry profits.

Currently it is very costly as Woods pointed out in the interview stating that it is “too expensive” to consider right now. (Would this excuse work if you threw your trash in the street and told your neighbors/city it’s “too expensive” to pay taxes for trash pickup? try it out and report back in the comments.) And the least expensive carbon storage would be to leave that carbon in the ground where it currently is in the first place.

On this tack Exxon has recently asked for a higher carbon price because this would help incentivize companies to develop carbon capture technology which is true – if Exxon or some other company could eventually capture carbon at a cost of $80 a ton and the carbon price is $100 a ton. Then it could profit by removing carbon from the air and this will incentivize cleanup while disincentivizing pollution.

But we’ve heard this carbon pricing story before from Exxon. Last year Exxon lobbyist Keith McCoy was caught on tape by Greenpeace revealing the company’s reason for publicly supporting carbon pricing. The lobbyist said that Exxon felt it was politically safe to advocate for carbon pricing because it makes the company look good (known as “greenwashing“) but that “a carbon tax is not going to happen” so Exxon benefits from goodwill but gets to continue benefiting from massive subsidies.

It is possible that Exxon has now earnestly changed its position only one year later but even if it has it certainly feels like Exxon may have only changed that position because it sees potential for profit. And given Exxon’s history on climate the wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing theory is quite persuasive.

The mess is Exxon’s – why should it profit from cleanup?

In the interview Woods completely failed to take responsibility for Exxon’s tremendous contributions to climate change. When Faber asked whether there is any question that climate change is human-made Woods stated that there’s no question it is and that “it was always understood that CO2 in the atmosphere had potential for warming.”

This statement is true; scientists have known for a long time that CO2 increases warming and that humans are causing this. But Woods blatantly ignored a half-century of Exxon’s efforts to cast doubt on climate science which it is currently being tried in court over and which McCoy admitted to in Greenpeace’s investigation. Exxon knew climate change was happening and lied about it and Woods not only doesn’t acknowledge those lies but claims Exxon never told those lies – which is itself another lie.

And while Exxon plans to lower its carbon emissions and become carbon neutral by 2050 that only accounts for its “scope 1 and 2” carbon emissions. This only counts company-owned facilities and vehicles and the energy they use but it does not account for the impact of various impacts like distribution leased assets employee travel and most importantly Exxon’s products which account for the vast majority of any fossil fuel company’s “scope 3” emissions (for Exxon about 85% of its emissions are scope 3).

Exxon has not committed to carbon neutrality for scope 3 emissions so its “carbon neutral” commitment means it will offset 100%… of 15% of its emissions.

Part of Woods’ plan includes other ways to leverage Exxon’s vast store of hydrocarbons and its existing infrastructure into cleaner-burning fuels. Rather than eliminating petrochemicals from our energy supply which is necessary for the climate Woods wants blue hydrogen (cracked from methane rather than green hydrogen which is generated through electrolysis of water) biofuels and ammonia to play a part in the conversation. He is sure to point out the “challenges” of solar wind and battery storage – three products his company isn’t involved in. And he explained how LNG could fix Europe’s heating issues rather than geothermal heat pumps electric heating or other less-polluting or more efficient solutions. Weird – almost like he’s selling us something.

Despite that Exxon a single company has sold products responsible for almost 3% of all of humanity’s historical carbon emissions Woods claims that Exxon can be a large part of the cleanup which seems appropriate since Exxon made the mess in the first place.

And at the $100/ton price that Exxon seems to favor it would cost several trillion dollars to make up for its historical contribution to carbon emissions and at least $65 billion for its scope 3 emissions for the year 2020. Exxon made $181 billion in revenue and $30 billion in profit in 2020.

But rather than spending the $65 billion a year it needs to clean up its scope 3 CO2 at the price it favors Exxon has announced a plan to spend just $15 billion over 6 years ($2.5 billion per year) on its scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction plan.

The emissions blame game

Woods plays the blame game which is so common with every entity these days with respect to climate change. In this game everyone stands around pointing fingers blaming some other entity for climate change absolving themselves as only responding to market forces and claiming that action can only happen once some other entity takes action first.

Exxon in this case was only responding to “consumer demand” and still responds to consumer demand selling oil because there are buyers for it. Woods foresees continuing to meet that demand and considers Exxon the savior for people around the world who are “living in energy poverty.” But a large majority of currently proven oil reserves must stay in the ground if we want to avoid catastrophe and that catastrophe will disproportionately affect those people living in poverty. He also blames government for not crafting consistent and efficient regulation after Exxon has lobbied against action for decades.

Meanwhile consumers point out Exxon’s contribution to climate change – the 2.6% of scope 3 carbon emissions the company’s products are responsible for – and claim there is a lack of nonpolluting options. Then blame government for not acting to pass climate legislation while also complaining about high prices for a fuel that needs to stay in the ground anyway and basing their votes on whichever candidate “seems more fun to have a beer with” rather than which one will keep our only home from burning.

And governments stand by in a cowardly manner because of fear that voters will blame them for any disruption of the energy industry and that companies will leverage their power toward unseating any representative who affects the profits of established polluting firms (rather than funding them as those firms currently do).

This behavior is echoed on a worldwide level as governments and citizens wonder why they should act when that other country over there “isn’t doing enough” – a common excuse used by the world’s climate criminals.

So everybody points the finger at everybody else and uses this to absolve themselves of blame and to justify inaction.

And the worst part is that everyone is partially right. Nobody is doing enough. Everyone can do more.

But the “wait and see” approach (or worse Exxon’s “propose solutions you think are too unpopular or not technologically or politically viable enough to happen” approach) doesn’t solve any problems. We can’t all stand around pointing fingers and loudly proclaiming our innocence while the boat sinks. We have to grab a pail and start bailing and the more powerful entities like perhaps the 16th largest company by market cap in the world have to leverage that power to bail harder.

Exxon mustn’t wait for the carbon prices to incentivize cleanup – it needs to clean up its mess now and make up for the century of messes it has caused and the lies it continues to tell. Consumers have to stop making excuses for sticking to the status quo and need to demand more action from governments and from themselves because everyone’s life is going to have to change somehow or another to fix the biggest problem humanity has ever faced (and caused). And governments need to take courageous and bold action and call Exxon’s bluff on carbon pricing – which a majority of Americans in every congressional district support.

And if we do all that maybe we’ll even beat Exxon Mobil’s 2040 all-EV target.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3Nob3VsZC1pLWJ1eS1yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tc3RvY2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should I Buy Royal Caribbean Stock?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/should-i-buy-royal-caribbean-stock on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3Nob3VsZC1pLWJ1eS1yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tc3RvY2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3RveW90YS1oYXMtbW9yZS1iYWQtbmV3cy1mb3ItdmVoaWNsZS1vd25lcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toyota Has More Bad News for Vehicle Owners,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/toyota-has-more-bad-news-for-vehicle-owners on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3RveW90YS1oYXMtbW9yZS1iYWQtbmV3cy1mb3ItdmVoaWNsZS1vd25lcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Almost immediately after that the owner of a heavily modified Tesla Model S Plaid almost died on track because wasn't he wearing a helmet or using any safety gear of any kind.

Chet from the Chillin' with Chet YouTube channel owned a Tesla Model S Plaid that he modified for track use. He gutted most of the interior save for the passenger seat and even removed the rear hatch all in the name of saving weight. It's the same Tesla that he decided to drive underwater to see if an electric car could do such a thing which damaged the car's electric drive units. However after replacing those units and continuing to track the car he noticed that its brakes just couldn't keep up something many owners and journalists have noticed about the stock Model S Plaid. So he decided to upgrade the front calipers rotors and pads with new ones from Unplugged Performance.

The upgraded brakes should have worked far better than the car's stock brakes thanks to much bigger calipers carbon ceramic rotors and track compound pads. However he didn't upgrade the rear brakes instead he just replaced them with new stock parts and seemingly didn't upgrade the brake fluid. He bled the fluid when doing the brake job but didn't say anything about upgrading the fluid. When you're driving a 1000 horsepower nearly 5000-pound car on track regularly you should probably use racing brake fluid.

Chillin' with Chet

After only a few minutes on track with his newly upgraded brakes those very same brakes went soft on him while charging hard into a corner sending him into the tire barrier. Before his brakes failed in the corner Chet said he was doing 170 mph. At the end of the video Chet said he's going to explain what happened in a video to come but there's a good chance the stock brake fluid is the culprit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGVzbGEtaXMtc2Fja2luZy1zdGFmZi13aG8tcmVjZW50bHktc3RhcnRlZC13aXRoZHJhd2luZy1qb2Itb2ZmZXJzLTIwMjItNtIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGVzbGEtaXMtc2Fja2luZy1zdGFmZi13aG8tcmVjZW50bHktc3RhcnRlZC13aXRoZHJhd2luZy1qb2Itb2ZmZXJzLTIwMjItNj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla is sacking staff who recently started and withdrawing job offers,"Elon Musk announced in June Tesla's headcount would increase.

Tesla has laid off workers who only started at the company months or even weeks ago.

An intern had his full-time offer rescinded while a recruiter was let go after just two weeks.

One employee said Tesla threatened to cut off health insurance if he refused the severance package.

Tesla workers who started their jobs only months or even weeks ago have been let go while others have had offers withdrawn as the company begins to impose cuts announced by Elon Musk in early June.

Insider found a number of posts from Tesla employees who said they'd been laid off as part of the cut while others had their job offers rescinded.

A senior employee who had only started earlier this year told Insider: ""I was very shocked when I was told that I was being let go. Being a manager I was under the impression that my position was safe.""

Asked how Tesla had decided which roles to cut he said: ""They said that layoffs were based on performance reviews but that is not true in my opinion because I had only been at Tesla for a few months and had yet to have performance goals set or a performance review. I asked what metrics they used and they refused to tell me.""

""The process definitely was not fair because I was never given the team that I requested.""

They added that ""the severance package was very unfair as they basically force you to accept by threatening to cut off medical insurance.""

Iain Abshier who was part of the recruiting team said on Tuesday in a LinkedIn post: ""Damn talk about a gut punch. Friday afternoon I was included in the Tesla layoffs after just two weeks of work.""

Robert Belovodskij had his job offer as a manufacturing controls development engineer"" rescinded. He said: ""The timing of the situation is also unfortunate as I was due to start in early August.""

At the start of June Musk told Tesla executives to pause all hiring because he had a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy and needed to cut 10% of the company's workforce. However he later tweeted that the headcount would increase but the number of salaried staff would not rise.

Mansi Chandresha started at Tesla in February as a data analyst and posted on LinkedIn after learning she was being cut: ""I have been trying to gather myself to the news that my position with Tesla was terminated.""

Nevertheless she added: ""I am grateful for the fact that I got an opportunity to work with a fantastic team.""

Chandresha said she was urgently seeking a new role before her student visa expired at the end of July.







Two former employees are suing the company claiming the electric carmaker violated federal law by laying off hundreds of employees on short notice.

John Lynch and Daxton Hartsfield who filed the lawsuit said at least 500 of their coworkers in Nevada lost their jobs at around the same time the document showed.

Insider found at least 11 more workers whose jobs had been cut. More are likely to suffer a similar fate as Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum last week that reduction would take effect over the next three months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9lbG9uLW11c2tzLXRlc2xhLWlzLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktbGF5aW5nLW9mZi1uZXctd29ya2Vycy13aXRoZHJhd2luZy1lbXBsb3ltZW50LW9mZmVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk's Tesla is reportedly laying off new workers withdrawing employment offers: 'Damn talk about a gut punch',"Cuts forewarned by Elon Musk in early June are reportedly being implemented at Tesla with employees who began work just weeks or months ago being let go and employment offers withdrawn.

A number of affected individuals have recently posted to social media about what they call lost jobs and rescinded offers. A manager who started with the company this year and was just laid off told Business Insider that he thought his position was safe.

Tesla said layoffs which reportedly number in the hundreds were based on performance reviews “but that is not true in my opinion because I had only been at Tesla for a few months and had yet to have performance goals set or a performance review” the employee who was not named told Insider.

The company refused to tell him what metrics were used to make the decision he said adding that he was “basically” forced to accept a severance package because the company threatened to terminate his medical insurance if he did not he told the news outlet.

Iain Abshier whose LinkedIn profile says he began work as a recruiter at Tesla this month announced last week on the social media site that he had been laid off “after just two weeks of work.”

“Damn talk about a gut punch” he wrote adding that the layoff had made him realize that recruitment was not his passion. Instead he opened a small business and decided to pursue training to become a professional firefighter “something I’ve dreamt of my entire life but was too cowardly to pursue whilst having a fruitful career.”

Robert Belovodskij whose LinkedIn profile says he interned at Tesla last year wrote on LinkedIn last week that his job offer to return to the company full-time had been rescinded. He graduated college in May and was set to begin in early August.

Two former Tesla employees sued the company earlier this month claiming the company had violated federal law by laying off hundreds of employees on short notice Insider previously reported.

Musk on Wednesday said his Germany and Texas plants are losing “billions of dollars” as the company attempts to ramp up production calling them “gigantic money furnaces” Bloomberg reported.

“The past two years have been an absolute nightmare of supply-chain interruptions one thing after another and we’re not out of it yet” Musk said according to the news outlet. “Overwhelmingly our concern is how do we keep the factories operating so we can pay people and not go bankrupt? The COVID shutdowns in China were very very difficult to say the least.”

Earlier this month Musk sent internal emails warning about layoffs of salaried employees saying he had a “super bad feeling” about the economy Bloomberg reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjIvMDYvMjcvdGVzbC1qMjcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk confirms termination of 10 percent of Tesla salaried employees amid economic turmoil,"On Tuesday Tesla CEO and multibillionaire Elon Musk confirmed that the company would be laying off as much as 10 percent of its salaried workforce or roughly 3.5 percent of its total workforce over the next three months. His announcement has taken place amid disruptions in supply chains which have impacted the electric vehicle industry a drop in Tesla’s stocks and numerous lawsuits filed against Tesla for frequent violations of labor and civil rights laws.

Earlier in the month Reuters stated that they had obtained emails sent from Musk to executives in which he expressed that he had a “super bad feeling” about the economy and would be carrying out a mass layoff of salaried employees and would “pause all hiring worldwide.”

Since the leaked information Musk has attempted to reassure employees about the current stability of the company while also openly admitting to Tesla’s economic uncertainty.

An email was sent out to all employees to clarify that the layoffs would “not apply to anyone actually building cars battery packs or installing solar.” He also stated that Tesla would continue to hire for hourly positions. However Electrek a news website focused on electric transportation later confirmed that there has been a second round of layoffs impacting hourly workers in sales and delivery teams.

The company reported in 2021 that it employed 100000 people which would translate to roughly 3500 layoffs by the end of the summer if the 3.5 percent figure given by Musk is accurate.

On Tuesday he attempted to reiterate his claims of stability giving a statement at the Qatar Economic Forum that “A year from now I think our [employee] headcount will be higher.” Musk’s statement likely reflects an attempt at damage control as Tesla stocks have spiraled following Reuters’ report on the layoffs.

Workers at the company have said they were “blindsided” by the sudden layoff. Some have also taken to social media to lament the poor working conditions among salaried employees at Tesla and to lament that they had not left the company sooner.

On TheLayoff.com one worker wrote: “They utilized PIP [performance improvement plan an internal policy often used to justify firings] to trim the people who they don't like for whatever reason. Obviously Elon doesn’t have any sense about this. He doesn’t think that feeding your family is his job as a boss.”

Another worker left an anonymous post that stated: “Musk has obviously lost his damn mind. He wants everybody to work 60+ hour weeks with no breaks no vacations no days off and certainly no work from home. All of this for the same pay (the lower the better)—just like the ‘exemplary’ employees in China do. You know the desperate people who have no other choice if they want to survive. That's his ideal employee. If you got away from that your situation can only improve.”

Musk’s public confirmation of mass firings took place between filing a lawsuit by former employees at Tesla’s factory in Sparks Nevada—where a separate mass firing took place—and the release of statements Musk gave in late May in which he raises the possibility of Tesla going into bankruptcy.

The lawsuit which was filed on June 19 by John Lynch and Daxton Harsfield alleges that Tesla carried out a mass firing of 500 workers at Gigafactory 2 in May and June. The plaintiffs allege that the largest electric vehicle producer was in violation of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act because it fired over 499 workers without providing a written notice 60 days in advance.

Tesla is also the subject of multiple other lawsuits including one alleging that the company allowed for “rampant sexual harassment” of women at the Fremont California factory. In a separate suit a judge had awarded Owen Diaz an African American elevator operator at Tesla’s Fremont plant $15 million in payment for the racial abuses he experienced on the job. Diaz has rejected the payment instead calling for a new trial claiming the amount would not change the conduct at the company. In an initial trial Diaz was awarded $137 million by a jury which was later reduced.

In June Solomon Chau a Tesla investor disclosed that he was also suing the company claiming the poor workplace culture is damaging the company’s reputation and in violation of its fiduciary responsibilities to investors. Chau’s suit specifically names Musk Tesla’s board members and the company as defendants.

Chau’s lawsuit likely also reflects growing concerns among investors over Tesla’s economic downturn. In an interview with Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley in late May but published this week Musk described the factories in Berlin Germany and Austin Texas as “gigantic money furnaces” which are unable to produce because of continued supply chain concerns. Musk specifically pointed to the inability to supply these factories with batteries due to COVID-19 related lockdowns in China.

Tesla operates a plant in Shanghai which produces batteries used in their vehicles.

Musk also raised the possibility of Tesla going into bankruptcy if it is unable to keep up production. Business experts have also pointed out that the company could face difficulty transferring funds out of China and that Tesla is likely going to announce a drop in earnings compared to the previous year. Analysts at Refinitiv estimated adjusted earnings could drop to $2.5 billion in the second quarter compared to $3.7 billion in the first quarter.

Musk’s statements are surprising given his history of making grandiose claims about the operations of various companies he is a part of. He has frequently used Twitter a company he is currently attempting to purchase as a means of encouraging stock and digital currency speculations.

Tesla’s high market valuation particularly compared to the number of vehicles it produces has largely been the byproduct of rampant speculation and the ruthless treatment of workers. Throughout the pandemic this has found a particularly sharp expression with Musk rejecting remote work and violating California’s lockdown measures to reopen the Fremont factory.

The announced firings confirm that in times of economic downturn Tesla and other companies will respond even more ruthlessly to unload the crisis onto the workers.

Notably the layoffs at Tesla have coincided with job cuts among the more traditional automakers as well as tech companies and portends further attacks on autoworkers.

The development underscores the need to build a broad-based working class movement to oppose continued attacks on jobs and fight for better working conditions. The WSWS encourages both salaried and hourly workers at Tesla to contact us about building a rank-and-file committee and coordinate your struggle with other workers through the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees (IWA-RFC).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi90ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC1zLXBsYWlkLWNoYWxsZW5nZXMtYW5kLWJlYXRzLWZvcmQtbXVzdGFuZy1idXQtd2hlcmVzLXRoZS1mdW4taW4tdGhhdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model S Plaid Challenges (And Beats) Ford Mustang But Where's The Fun In That?,"We wonder if winning drag races matters if the car does all the work for you

How can one both win and lose a drag race at the same time? Well in this case it seems that the internet takes a drab driving experience as a big fat L. The video in question shows a Tesla Model S Plaid baiting a Ford Mustang into a drag race with somewhat predictable results but it’s sparked debate.

Featured on the YouTube channel Supercar_Shar the film is short but shows a pair of gentlemen rolling up behind a Ford Mustang and then goading the driver into a roll race.

After the Mustang spots the Tesla we hear the driver of the pony car rev his motor a couple of times and then the Tesla driver says to himself “Oh you have no idea buddy you have no idea what’s going to happen to you.” The video immediately cuts to later down the road when the two cars are lined up and the Tesla driver tells the Ford driver to “Go ahead hit it hit it hit it.”

After just a rev or two the Mustang seems to just barely begin actually accelerating before the Tesla blows its doors off. The video then cuts to an interior shot showing the car as it goes down the road with Full Self Driving engaged and we hear the front passenger say “And it drives itself unbelievable.”

Commenters have not been coy with regard to how the Tesla driver makes them feel. “I like how the Mustang driver was smiling and having fun with it. The Tesla dude was cringe” said one. Another said ” Looks like the Mustang is having more fun than you sitting there doing nothing lol.” And that seems to be the key to the online hate to some degree.

Rally legend Colin McRae is widely credited with this quote: “Straight roads are for fast cars turns are for fast drivers.” Today that thought could be extended to the dramatic difference between how electric cars drive or accelerate and the way that a car like the Mustang does.

Sure modern cars have been nerfed in a bunch of different ways and typically technology that can keep drivers safe in most situations. At the same time if someone doesn’t pay enough attention or show enough respect they can end up in a wall a ditch or worse.

The Tesla Model S Plaid models offer a dramatically different experience when it’s time to drive fast in a straight line. You push the pedal down and the car will do the rest. That’s incredibly impressive but it begs the question can automakers make EVs that are as engaging to drive as modern sports cars? Some of them already handle exceptionally well in the bends but it’s tough to imagine one that can emulate the visceral feeling that Ford driver likely had even as he watched the Tesla speed away."

To investigate whether ribozymes previously selected for aminoacylation with BYO (tyrosine analog) would react with substrates having other aminoacyl side chains six additional biotinyl-aminoacyl oxazolones were synthesized for analysis (Fig. 1A): tryptophanyl (BWO) phenylalanyl (BFO) leucyl (BLO) isoleucyl (BIO) valyl (BVO) and methionyl (BMO). This set of substrates represents three chemical classes (small hydrophobic aromatic and sulfur-containing). Within the group of small hydrophobic side chains both β-branched and -unbranched residues were included. The set includes side chains that are considered early as well as side chains that are considered late additions to the genetic code5455565758. In particular aromatic residues of which two were chosen to assess specificity within the class are thought to have been added relatively late. The span over chemical space as well as putative prebiotic age of the substrates therefore probes general trends rather than a specific epoch during the emergence of translation. In order to assess the generality of any observed trend five wild-type ribozymes were chosen for analysis representing five different families containing three unrelated motifs (Supplementary Table 1).

Fig. 1: Aminoacylation activity of two ribozymes with BXO substrates. A Biotinyl aminoacyl oxazolones (BXO) used in this study: tryptophanyl (BWO) phenylalanyl (BFO) leucyl (BLO) isoleucyl (BIO) valyl (BVO) and methionyl (BMO). B Aminoacylation activity of two ribozymes (S-1A.1-a the center of Family 1A.1 and S-2.1-a the center of Family 2.1) with BXO substrates analyzed by streptavidin gel shift on native PAGE (X = F L I M V or W as indicated; see Methods for details). Reactions were conducted for 90 min at 500 μM BXO. The reacted RNA is detected by its slower migration through the gel due to complexation with streptavidin. This experiment was conducted once; also see Fig. S11. Since a single reactive site was identified (Fig. S12) multiple bands on native gels may be caused by the presence of multiple conformers or streptavidin oligomers. MW markers are the Low Molecular Weight Ladder (dsDNA) from NEB. Structures were drawn using ChemDraw 19.0. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image

Compounds were synthesized using previously described methods24 and verified by NMR spectroscopy (see Methods). An initial test by a streptavidin gel shift assay at high substrate concentration (500 μM) indicated that each oxazolone served as substrate for at least one ribozyme tested although the two tested ribozymes (S-1A.1-a and S-2.1-a) differed in selectivity (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. 11). For these ribozymes reaction products were not observed when a single residue (G65 and G54 respectively) was chemically modified to 2’-O-methyl indicating that reaction occurs at a single site (Supplementary Fig. 12A). This observation is consistent with previously reported results for these ribozymes reacting with BYO24. This result was further confirmed by direct PAGE analysis of the reaction product (without streptavidin added) under acidic conditions which shows a mobility difference between aminoacylated RNA and unreacted RNA (Supplementary Fig. 12B)59.

To study the cross-reactivity of these ribozymes and their mutants systematically pools of sequence variants were designed to explore the sequence space around five sequences representing each of the major ribozyme families obtained from the selection on BYO (Supplementary Table 1). The ribozyme families chosen for testing include all of the previously discovered motifs (Motifs 1 2 and 3) specifically the two most abundant families containing Motif 1 (Family 1A.1 and 1B.1) and Motif 2 (Family 2.1 and 2.2) as well as the only family identified from Motif 3 (Family 3.1). These ribozyme families had been discovered during an exhaustive search of sequence space varying a central 21-mer region and sequences from these motifs had comprised ~80% of the selected pool24. Sequencing of the variant pool showed that it included 13.5% of the unique sequences from the originally selected pool (having abundance ≥10−6). Thus the variant pool based on these five ribozyme families was designed to be representative of ribozymes having aminoacylation activity.

These ribozymes had been identified through selection with substrate BYO. To probe the sequence space for additional motifs we also performed in vitro selections using substrates BFO and BLO starting from libraries with completely random 21-mer variable regions. These selections followed a process identical to the original selection with the exception of the substrate compound. All families found in the BFO and BLO selections had already been identified in the earlier BYO selection (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly selection with BLO resulted predominantly in sequences containing Motif 2 consistent with the low activity of a Family 1A.1 ribozyme on BLO observed in the gel shift assay (Fig. 1B). While it is possible that cross-contamination of sequences from prior selection with BYO in the laboratory could bias the results of these selections the failure to identify new motifs indicated a lack of new ribozymes having appreciably greater activity on BFO or BLO suggesting that the designed pool of variants would likely include major motifs of the active sequence space.

Cross-reaction of self-aminoacylating ribozyme mutants with alternative side chains

Sequences in the ribozyme variant pool were assayed for activity on each alternative substrate in a massively parallel format by kinetic sequencing (k-Seq)244960. During k-Seq a pool containing thousands of candidate ribozymes was reacted with a substrate at multiple concentrations. The reacted molecules having been biotinylated through reaction were isolated by streptavidin binding and then sequenced on the Illumina platform. Quantitation of the reacted fraction was used to fit to a kinetic model to determine ribozyme activity. Data obtained from this method have been shown to correlate well with traditional biochemical assays with confidence intervals of the measurements obtained by experimental replicates and bootstrapping49. In each k-Seq experiment one of six BXO (X = W F L I V or M) substrates was tested to measure reaction kinetics for sequences in the pool. Samples were exposed to substrate concentrations from 2 to 1250 μM in triplicate. Reaction data were fit to a pseudo-first-order kinetic model (\({F}_{s}^{{BXO}}={A}_{s}(1-{e}^{-{k}_{s}[{BXO}]{\alpha }t})\)) with maximum reaction amplitude A s and rate constant k s for sequence s where \({F}_{s}^{{BXO}}\) is the fraction of RNA that is aminoacylated with substrate BXO [BXO] is the initial substrate concentration t is the reaction time (90 min) and α is the coefficient accounting for substrate hydrolysis during the reaction. The product k s A s  reflecting ribozyme activity at non-saturating conditions was accurately estimated across a wide range of activities2449 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The data yielded k s A s estimates for a total of 9770 sequences encompassing five family wild-type sequences and a complete set of both single and double mutants related to the five wild-type ribozymes (Supplementary Fig. 3).

k-Seq measures the combination of catalyzed and non-catalyzed (background) reactions. To measure the catalytic activity of the RNA the nonspecific background reactivity of the substrate with RNA should be taken into account. In analogy with catalytic power used to characterize enzymes we determined catalytic enhancement i.e. the ratio of catalyzed to background reaction rates. Since RNA sequences were being compared against each other it was natural to use the reactivity of the substrate with bulk low-activity RNA from the pool as the background reaction rate. We measured the rate of the background reaction for BFO by gel shift assay with the randomized RNA library. The background rate was 0.55 ± 0.18 M−1min−1 (μ ± σ) which is within error to that measured previously for BYO (0.65 ± 0.28 M−1min−1)24. Comparing to the frequency distribution of k s A s measured by k-Seq (Supplementary Fig. 4 Supplementary Table 2) the measured background rate was found to correspond to the center of a low-activity peak indicating that this peak represented a background of catalytically inactive or nearly inactive mutants. This is consistent with observations that individual Motif 1 ribozymes display little activity with some substrates at high concentration when analyzed by a gel-shift assay (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. 11). The low-activity peak was therefore used as an internal control in k-Seq and the effective background reaction rate (k 0 A 0 ) of each substrate was estimated as the center of this peak. k s A s values for sequences reacted with each substrate were normalized by the corresponding k 0 A 0 to obtain the catalytic enhancement above background or r s (defined as r s = k s A s /k 0 A 0 for each sequence s).

The r s values obtained from the k-Seq experiments revealed that all tested families contained sequences which displayed some activity on a new substrate or on multiple new substrates (Supplementary Fig. 5). Details of the frequency distribution of catalytic enhancement depended on both the aminoacyl side chain of the substrate as well as the ribozyme family. The distribution of sequences in Families 1A.1 1B.1 and 3.1 could be characterized as containing a peak centered around background activity accompanied by a long high-activity tail particularly with BWO and BFO (Supplementary Fig. 5). In contrast the distributions of Families 2.1 and 2.2 displayed distinct peaks at higher activity with bimodality apparent in some cases (especially for Family 2.1). This indicated a higher tolerance for mutations in Families 2.1 and 2.2 than in 1A.1 1B.1 and 3.1 as mutant sequences were less likely to exhibit substantial detrimental effects.

Ribozyme families distinguish different chemical features of substrate side chains

To assess the activity and specificity of individual ribozyme mutants for each substrate catalytic enhancement values for different substrates were compared in a pairwise fashion (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 6). All families displayed a high degree of correlation among activities for non-aromatic amino acid analogs (BLO (Leu) BIO (Ile) BVO (Val) and BMO (Met)) and also between activities for the two aromatic analogs (BWO (Trp) and BFO (Phe)) (Fig. 3A). The high correlations indicated that few sequences exhibit large activity differences between amino acids within the same biochemical class.

However when comparing amino acids of different classes (i.e. aromatic vs. non-aromatic) strong correlations were only observed for Families 2.1 and 2.2 indicating that the effects of mutations in Motif 2 sequences tend to be relatively independent of the side chain. In contrast Families 1A.1 1B.1 and 3.1 showed substantially lower activity with non-aromatic side chains (Fig. 2) resulting in lower correlations between activity on aromatic and non-aromatic side chains (Fig. 3A). These preferences were also captured by the slopes on the correlation plots (Fig. 3B) which confirm that Motif 1 sequences strongly favor aromatic side chains while Motif 2 sequences demonstrate less pronounced preferences and Motif 3 sequences display an intermediate strength of preference. While less pronounced than for Motif 1 some preferences were still observed for Motif 2 sequences in which BFO was most preferred BMO BWO and BLO were weakly preferred and BVO and BIO were disfavored. Interestingly BVO and BIO in contrast to the other side chains are both branched at the β carbon position. For Family 3.1 BFO was preferred over BWO and all non-aromatic substrates were similarly disfavored. The differences observed between trends characterizing the separate ribozyme motifs suggest differences in the recognition mechanisms among Motifs 1 2 and 3. Nevertheless all ribozyme families display some preferences that correspond to chemical features of the side chains.

Substrate specificity is positively correlated with activity

To probe the relationship between catalytic activity and substrate specificity we used two measures of specificity. First as a general measure of substrate specificity for each sequence we adapted the ‘promiscuity index’61. Here promiscuity refers to the ability of a sequence to react with multiple substrates at a similar level of activity. The promiscuity index \(({I}_{s}=-\frac{1}{{\log }N}{\sum }_{i=1}^{N}\frac{{r}_{i}}{{\sum }_{j=1}^{N}{r}_{j}}{\log }\frac{{r}_{i}}{{\sum }_{j=1}^{N}{r}_{j}})\) is a normalized entropy which describes the evenness of the distribution of rates across different substrates. The promiscuity index I s ranges from 0 to 1 such that sequences that are completely promiscuous having equal activity on all substrates would have I s = 1 and sequences completely specific to one substrate would have I s = 0. Promiscuity was observed to decrease as overall activity increased for all families (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 7).

Fig. 4: Relationship between activity and promiscuity. Promiscuity index values for each sequence as a function of total activity (sum of activities with all tested substrates). The general trend indicates that specificity increases (promiscuity decreases) as overall activity increases. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image

Second since ribozymes in some families displayed preferential activity with aromatic amino acids compared to non-aromatic amino acids we calculated the relative preference for aromatic substrates as \(({r}_{s}^{{BWO}}+{r}_{s}^{{BF}O})/{\sum }_{X}{r}_{s}^{{BXO}}\). This ‘aromatic preference’ ratio reflects the proportion of ribozyme products that would have aromatic side chains in a reaction containing all six substrates at equal sub-saturating concentration (Supplementary Fig. 8). Both the aromatic preference and the promiscuity index showed that the total activity of a sequence was positively correlated with specificity (positively correlated with aromatic preference and negatively correlated with promiscuity index; Table 1).

Abundance of opportunities for co-option for alternative substrates

Sequences that can function with multiple substrates could potentially be co-opted to adopt new functions (i.e. react with new substrates). To quantify the frequency of sequences able to react with multiple substrates we categorized sequences as active or inactive using a catalytic enhancement threshold r t . Sequences below this threshold are considered to be nearly inactive being close to the background rate (see above). An activity threshold of r t = 5 was chosen for two reasons. First this threshold is two-fold more than the estimated 95% range for background activity (Supplementary Fig. 4 Supplementary Table 2) so values of r s > 5 are statistically significantly greater than the normalized background rate. Second increasing the rate of reaction by a factor of 5 is potentially significant in a prebiotic context as abundances are expected to depend exponentially on relative fitness. Using this threshold ribozyme mutants that were active on more than one substrate were considered capable of co-option (i.e. potentially able to adopt a new substrate).

Consistent with the observation that sequences in Families 2.1 and 2.2 displayed a high level of correlation of activities among all tested substrates these families also had the most sequences being active with at least two substrates (1029 sequences in Family 2.1; 853 sequences in Family 2.2) and many were active with all six tested substrates (Fig. 5). Such sequences would be capable of co-option for new substrates. In contrast Families 1A.1 1B.1 and 3.1 which contain more inactive sequences and generally preferred aromatic amino acids had most sequences accepting only one (or zero) substrates. Of sequences accepting multiple substrates in Families 1A.1 1B.1 and 3.1 most were only active with two substrates. Nevertheless even in these families >2% of sequences accepted 2 or more substrates (254 sequences in Family 1A.1 278 sequences in Family 1B.1 and 43 sequences in Family 3.1).

The frequency distribution of the fraction of unique sequences in each family (y-axis) that is active on a given number of substrates (x-axis). Activity on 2 or more substrates indicates potential for co-option. While Motif 2 sequences (Families 2.1 and 2.2) show a higher abundance of sequences active on more substrates all families possess some sequences with activity on multiple substrates.

Increase of co-opted activity on the fitness landscape

The sequences identified as presenting opportunities for co-option are active on two (or more) substrates but may not be optimally active on either. To determine how readily co-option might lead to a sequence with increased activity (i.e. to the optimally active sequence on a given substrate within the sequence space explored here) through evolution over the fitness landscape we investigated the connectivity of optimal sequences (i.e. fitness peaks) for each substrate within the fitness landscape defined by each substrate for each ribozyme family. With the exception of Family 3.1 the substrate peaks (highest r s ) for each family were accessible to one another by evolutionary pathways proceeding through single mutations while maintaining some activity (i.e. maintaining \({\sum }_{X}{r}_{s}^{{BXO}} > 30\) in analogy to r t = 5 for 6 substrates) (Fig. 6). Family 3.1 was unique among families in that the few co-optable sequences active on non-aromatic substrates were isolated in sequence space from the larger number of aromatic-preferring ribozyme mutants. While aromatic substrates were generally preferred substantial increases in the activity on non-aromatic substrates could be obtained through 1-2 mutations. This analysis indicates that the number of mutations from wild-type required to improve activity on a new substrate can be relatively small.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zMTIyMC040gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein forms nuclear condensates and regulates alternative splicing,"Cells used and culture conditions

iPSCs generation

The episomal vector-based reprogramming was performed as in refs. 2526. Briefly fibroblasts were nucleofected with the episomal vectors using a Nucleofector II (Lonza) with program U20. Five days after nucleofection fibroblasts were reseeded onto mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The reprogrammed colonies were allowed to grow until they were ready to be mechanically picked and transferred onto MEFs. Upon successful expansion of the iPSC lines on MEFs they were then cultured on Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in mTeSR medium (StemCell Technologies). Analyses of pluripotency of iPSCs including detection of transgene insertion transgene expression teratoma formation immunostaining of pluripotency markers and karyotyping were carried out as in refs. 2526.

A total of 20.4 kb of WAS homology sequence and FRT-PGK-EM7-neo-bpA-FRT cassette were subcloned into the HDAdV plasmid pCIHDAdGT8-4 (kindly provided by Dr. Kohnosuke Mitani) (Suzuki et al.32). The WAS-c-HDAdV virus was generated according to a published method3282. Briefly the WAS-c-HDAdV plasmid was linearized by PI-SceI (New England Biolabs) and transfected into 116 cells (a kind gift from Dr. Philip Ng) in the presence of helper virus AdHPBGF35 (a kind gift from Dr. André M. Lieber). Crude virus extracts were serially amplified in 116 cells and the purified. βgal-transducing units (btu) were determined in 293 cells to define infectious vector titers.

Isolation of gene-corrected human iPSCs

For the generation of gene-corrected iPSCs 2.5–3.0 × 106 WAS patient iPSCs were infected with WAS-c-HDAdV at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3-30 btu/cell. Two days after infection G418 (50 μg/ml; Invitrogen) was added to the medium to start positive selection. After 9 days 2 μM Ganciclovir (GANC; Invitrogen) in addition to G418 was added to the medium to start negative selection. After an additional 8 days G418/GANC double-resistant clones were transferred to 96-well plates and expanded for further characterization. Gene-targeted clones were determined by PCR of genomic DNA from drug-resistant clones with the following primers (P1 5’-CATCCTGCCCCAGCCGACCAGACCTTAATGCTC-3’; P2 5’-CCCCAAAGGCCTACCCGCTTCCATTGCTCA-3’; P3 5’-CTACCTGCCCATTCGACCACCAAGCGAAACATC-3’; P4 5’- AAATTTTCCGCCATCTTTCCCCACGGCTAACGAC-3’; see Fig. 1e) using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase (TAKARA). To determine gene-corrected clones for exon 1 exon 1 of WAS was PCR-amplified with the following primers: 5’-CCACCCAGGCCCATGACTACTCCTTGCCACA-3’ and 5’- AGGCAACCATCCCGGCTGAGAGAATACCCA-3’ with PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase. To determine gene-corrected clones for exon 10 exon 10 of WAS was PCR-amplified with the following primers: 5’-ACTGCTTCAGTCAGGAGTTG-3’ and 5’-GAGGCTGACACAAGATTCAT-3’ with PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase. Amplicons were sequenced using an ABI 3730 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The inserted neomycin-resistance cassette was removed using the FLP/FRT system80.

Knockout iPSC generation

We used a previously well-characterized wild-type iPSC line2633 (46XX) to perform homozygous knockout of the WAS gene using CRISPR-Cas9. To knock out the entire WAS gene sgRNAs targeting upstream and downstream of the WAS gene with the following protospacer and protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences–5’-CCAAGCTCAGCCTAACGAGG-AGG-3’ (upstream) and 5’-GGATTTCACCCCCTAAGGGC-AGG-3’ (downstream)–were synthesized by in vitro transcription using the T7 MEGAshortscript kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Neon transfection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1600 v/10 ms/3 pulses) was used for electroporating 200 k single cells with 50 pmol Cas9 protein and 25 pmol each sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) in buffer R (provided by Neon kit). After electroporation iPSCs were cultured in Essential 8 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with ROCKi (Abcam) on rhLaminin521 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated 24-well plates. The cells were dissociated by TrypleE after 48 h and subsequently 1000 single cells were seeded on laminin521 coated six-well plates. After 7 days half of the colony was picked for genotyping by PCR using the following primers: (F1 5’-GTAGTAACCCTTCCGGACTA-3’ and R1 5’-CGTAAAGGCGGATGAAGTAG-3’; F2 5’-TCACACTCACCCAACAATCC-3’ and R2 5’-TAACTGGGCCGACATTTCTC-3’ see Fig. 1d). The genotyping results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Plasmid construction

The FLAG-tagged WASP WASPF36* WASPΔEX2 and WASPL425fs were cloned into the pLenti-CAG-PL9 (kind gift from the Drs. Inder Verma and Ronald Evans) using the Gibson Assembly® HiFi 1-Step Kit (Cat# GA1100-10 San Diego Synthetic Genomics CA). The pHR-mCh-Cry2WT was purchased from Addgene (Cat# 101221). The SRSF2-GFP plasmid was purchased from OriGene (Cat# RG209842). The nuclear actin-Chromobody plasmid (TagGFP2) was purchased from Chromotek (Cat# Acg-n). The HP1α-GFP was purchased from Addgene (Cat# 17652). A nuclear localization signal (NLS) was added to C-terminal of Cry2WT in pHR-mCh-Cry2WT. N- and C-terminus IDRs of WAS were cloned to the N-terminal side of mCherry in the pHR-mCh-Cry2WT-NLS plasmid and the WASP coding sequence was cloned to either the N-terminal side of mCherry or the C-terminal side of Cry2WT-NLS in the pHR-mCh-Cry2WT-NLS plasmid. All the constructs generated were subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm accurate sequences.

Lentivirus production

shRNA lentiviral vectors targeting SRSF2 (TRCN0000000106 and TRCN0000000109) were purchased from the Mission shRNA library of Sigma-Aldrich. Lentiviruses were generated by co-transfecting the 293 T cells (ATCC) with the lentiviral vectors together with the packaging plasmids (pMDLg/pRRE pRSV-Rev and pMD2.G from Addgene 12251 12253 and 12259 respectively) into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Cat# L3000-015 Invitrogen). Lentiviruses were collected 24 h after transfection filtered through a 0.45-mM filter and concentrated using the PEG-it virus precipitation solution (SBI).

Fluorescence in situ hybridization

The WAS-c-HDAdV probe was custom labeled with 5-TAMRA by Empire Genomics (Buffalo NY). 5-fluorescein-labeled chromosome 11 probe was purchased from Empire Genomics. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature permeabilized with Triton X-100 and repeated freezing in liquid nitrogen and deproteinized by treating with 0.1 M HCl. Hybridization was carried out at 37 °C overnight. Samples were counterstained with DAPI mounted and examined using a Zeiss LSM 780 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope.

Hematopoietic differentiation

Hematopoietic differentiation efficiency and hematopoietic colony formation activity were assayed as described in ref. 83 with some modifications. Briefly iPSCs and ESCs cultured on MEF feeders in human ESC medium were manually dissociated and plated on OP9 feeders to start differentiation. Cells were co-cultured with the OP9 feeders for 12–14 days in OP9 differentiation medium (Alpha MEM containing 10% Hyclone defined FBS (GE Life Sciences catalog number SH30070.03) 100 μM monothioglycerol (Cat# M6145 Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Cat# A4544 Sigma-Aldrich). Differentiated cells were dissociated with collagenase and Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies) and subjected to flow cytometry analyses cell sorting qPCR analyses and clonogenic progenitor cell assays. Macrophage and dendritic cell differentiation were performed as described84. Briefly 2-week differentiated hiPSC were harvested and the non-adherent fraction (or FACS sorted CD34+/CD43+) were cultured under myeloid progenitor expansion condition (IMDM 10% FBS GM-CSF (100 ng/ml Peprotech cat# 300-03) M-CSF (50 ng/ml Peprotech cat# 300-25)) for 10 days and then induced to maturity by lineage-specific cytokines. Macrophages were matured in X-vivo 10 (Lonza Cat#BE04-380Q) supplemented with 50 ng/ml M-CSF for 1 week. DC differentiation was induced using DC differentiation medium (RPMI-1640 plus 10% FBS GM-CSF (100 ng/ml) IL4 (10 ng/ml Peprotech)). DCs were matured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS 10 ng/ml TNFα 10 ng/ml IL4 and 3 μg/ml LPS (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# L3024-5MG).

Characterization of iPSC-derived cells

Characterization of the identity of iMPs and iDCs using lineage-specific cell surface markers were performed as described in a published protocol85. Briefly 100 K cells were washed in FACS buffer (1× PBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ 2 mM EDTA 2% FBS) and pelleted at 400×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl FACS buffer in a 5-ml polystyrene test tube. Antibodies or isotype controls were added to the cell suspension and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Four milliliters of FACS buffer were added to wash the cells. The washed cells were pelleted at 400×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were resuspended in FACS buffer without FBS and analyzed on a flow cytometer. Macrophage morphology was quantitated using the circularity plugin of ImageJ. Macrophage phagocytosis assay was performed with pHrodo™ Red E. coli BioParticles® Conjugate for Phagocytosis (Cat# P35361 Life Technologies Carlsbad CA). The pHrodo red particles were prepared according to the manual and opsonized Escherichia coli BioParticles® opsonizing Reagent (Life Technologies Carlsbad CA) as instructed. Adherent macrophages were incubated with pHrodo red E. coli particles for 1 h at 37 °C dissociated washed and analyzed by FACS. Migration assay was performed using the CytoSelect™ 24-Well Cell Migration Assay 5 µm kit (Cat# CBA-102 Cell Biolabs inc. San Diego CA) or using 24-well Transwell plates with 5-µm pore inserts (Corning Inc. Maine USA) as follows: 50000 macrophages were resuspended in 100 µl X-Vivo-10 serum-free medium (Lonza Cat#BE04-380Q) with 30 µM R848 (Stem Cell Technologies) and seeded in the insert; IMDM medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% FBS and 5 ng/ml CCL3 was added in the lower compartment; The cells of the insert were stained by crystal violet (BD) after 12 h of incubation at 37 °C 5% CO 2 and the cells on the upper surface of the insert were removed by cotton swabs; the number of migratory cells was measured using the imageJ software (ver. 1.51 s).

Clonogenic progenitor cell assay

Hematopoietic clonogenic assays were performed in 35-mm low-adherent plastic dishes (Stem Cell Technologies) in triplicate using 1.1 ml/dish of MethoCult GF + H4435 semisolid medium (Cat# 04435 Stem Cell Technologies) or StemMACS human HSC-CFU complete medium with Epo (Cat# 130-091-280 Miltenyi Biotec). Colony-forming cells (CFCs) were scored after 15 days of incubation. Cytospins were stained with the Diff stain kit (IMEB K7128) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

qRT-PCR

Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed with the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) and iScript™ Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Cat# 1708840 Biorad). Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out with SsoAdvanced™ Universal SYBR® Green Supermix (Cat# 1725270 Biorad) or PrimeTime® Gene Expression Master Mix (Cat# 1055770 IDT) coupled with fluorescently labeled probes on a CFX384 real-time PCR detection system (Biorad). The oligonucleotides used in this paper are shown in Supplementary Data 5.

Live-cell imaging

The Cry2 fusion constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 3000. After 24 h the HEK293 cells were seeded in eight-well µ-slides with a glass bottom (Ibidi). All live-cell imaging was performed using ×93 glycerol objective on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a chambered stage maintaining a humid environment at 37 °C 5% CO 2 . Generally cells were activated by a laser with a wavelength of 488 nm and imaged by a laser with a wavelength of 580 nm.

Serum starvation and stimulation

Before serum starvation the HEK293 cells were transfected with the Cry2 fusion constructs using Lipofectamine 3000 and cultured in DMEM medium with 10% FBS for 24 h. Subsequently cells were harvested and seeded in eight-chamber slides in DMEM medium without FBS overnight. The medium was replaced by 20% FBS DMEM medium for one hour (for nascent RNA labeling the 20% FBS medium was mixed with 1 mM 5-ethynyl uridine (Thermo Fisher cat # C10329)). The cells were exposed under blue light for 10 min to induce optogenetic droplet formation and immediately fixed by 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature to be ready for the further staining experiment. We used a Click-it RNA imaging kit (Thermo Fisher cat # C10329) to stain nascent RNA followed a standard protocol provided by the kit.

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay

FRAP assay of optoWASP was performed on a Leica SP8 confocal equipped with a live-imaging chambered stage. The optoWASP positive cells were activated by 488 nm laser and monitored by 588 nm laser in a live mode every 5 s until the droplets reached proper sizes. The photobleaching applied 588 nm laser with 100% power for 20 iterations for a circular region with ~1.0 µm in diameter containing a droplet inside. Images were acquired for five prebleach frames with 2 s interval time and 30 postbleach frames with 10-s interval time. For the FRAP assay of SRSF2-GFP and HP1α-GFP 0.5 μg plasmid were delivered to 1 × 105 WT iMP or WASP-KO-iMPs using the Neon transfection system (Thermo Scientific). The electroporation parameters are as follow: pulse voltage 1900 v; pulse width 30 ms; pulse number 1. Cells were cultured for 24 h before imaging. The same amount of HP1α-GFP was transferred into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000. FRAP was performed on ZEISS LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope. Pixel dwell is 0.42 microseconds for SRSF2-GFP and 0.67 microseconds for HP1α-GFP. Bleaching was carried out for 50 iterations with 100% 405-nm laser. Images were collected every 1.04 microseconds for SRSF2-GFP and every 1 s for HP1α-GFP. After image acquisition the data were analyzed using FRAP module installed in ZEISS software. The t-half and mobile fraction were used for statistical analysis and the time-lapse data were used for generating the FRAP curve.

Immunofluorescence analysis

Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100. After a blocking step with 10% normal donkey serum in PBS cells were incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation at room temperature with the corresponding secondary antibody for 1 h. Nuclei were counterstained with 4’6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). For condensate disruption cells were treated with 1% 16-HD (AAA1243936 Thermo Scientific) for 20 min followed by fixation and permeabilization. Images were acquired with a ZEISS LSM 780 laser-scanning inverted confocal microscope or Leica SP8 TCS STED 3X microscope. Afterward we used the Avizo 2021.1 software to analyze the 3D information of the captured nuclear speckles. Specifically we used the interactive thresholding module to segment the nuclear speckles. Then we used the mean and volume3d functions from the label analysis module to calculate their mean fluorescence intensity and volume.

Colocalization analysis of optoWASP confocal images

The proteins were labeled by excitation wavelength well-separated dyes of Alexa Fluor 488 mCherry and Alexa Fluor 647 and the high-resolution images were collected by a Leica SP8 TCS STED ×3 microscope using the lightning mode with the lowest channel cross-talk setting. The colocalization was analyzed by the Leica LAS X microscope software. The whole single cell was circled as a region of interest (ROI) for colocalization analysis of optoWASP and SRSF2 or Pol II. The nucleoli where rRNA are highly expressed but without visible optoWASP expression were not included in ROIs for colocalization analysis of optoWASP and nascent RNA. The Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) value was calculated within the ROIs.

Transmission electron microscopy

Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 5 min at 37 °C and then transferred to 4 °C and brought to the Salk Biophotonics core facility for further processing. Media were removed and washed with warmed buffer before the fixative solution (2.5% glutaraldehyde + 2% paraformaldehyde + 2 mM CaCl 2 in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer). Cells were washed and fixed again (1% OsO 4 and 0.3% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer 2 mM CaCl 2 ) and for 1 h on ice in the dark. After washing cells were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for one hour on ice in the dark. The cells were then washed in distilled water and acetone or ethanol series. Embedding was done with Spurr’s embedding kit. After cleaning with methanol the slides were coated with Teflon and let dry. The embedded samples were flattened using two glass slides in resin. The samples were imaged using a Carl Zeiss Libra 120 kV PLUS Energy Filtered Transmission Electron Microscope that is equipped with a 2k × 2k fiber optically coupled YAG CCD camera.

Proximity ligation assay and colocalization analysis

Proximity ligation assay (PLA) is a method that allows in situ detection of protein interactions with high sensitivity and specificity. Briefly two primary antibodies raised in different species are used to label the target proteins (e.g. WASP and SRSF2). PLA probes which are species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated with a short oligonucleotide sequence bind to the primary antibodies. When the target proteins are in proximity (<30–40 nm) the oligonucleotides of the two different PLA probes can participate in rolling circle amplification. The amplified DNA can then be visualized by a fluorescent oligonucleotide probe generating strong fluorescence signals (e.g. red spots in confocal images). These red PLA spots indicated the locations where WASP interacts with its partner proteins. PLA was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the Duolink® In Situ Red Starter Kit Mouse/Rabbit (DUO92101-1KT Sigma-Aldrich). In all 0.2 million WT B cells were spun onto slides (pre-coated with 1% of FBS) using a PrO-Cyt Centrifuge. Then WT B cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and further permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 min. After blocking with the blocking buffer in the kit (DUO92004-30RXN Sigma-Aldrich) slides were treated with two different primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The primary antibodies mouse monoclonal anti-WASP antibody (D-1) (Cat# SC-5300 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal isotype (Cat# ab37415 Abcam) were used as a negative control. The next day Duolink® In Situ PLA® Probe Anti-Mouse MINUS and Duolink® In Situ PLA® Probe Anti-Rabbit PLUS were mixed together and applied to the samples. Each slide was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After washing the ligation and amplification were performed following the Duolink® In Situ Detection Reagents Red kit instructions. If needed an Alexa fluor 488 secondary antibody was applied to the sample to visualize the green immunofluorescence signal of target proteins. Finally using Duolink® In Situ Mounting Medium with DAPI (DUO82040-5ML Sigma-Aldrich) to stain nuclei with DAPI and protect PLA signals. PLA signals were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan function. To quantify the PLA signal number we randomly picked 50 cells from five different images using a ×63 oil objective. PLA signals were checked carefully in the Z-stack mode in the ZEN software. For colocalization analysis the color threshold function in the Fiji software was used. We define a yellow color (20–50) as colocalization which is generated from the PLA signal in the red channel and SRSF2 or POI II signal in the green channel.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis

The WASnull B cells and WT B cells described above or WASnull B cells expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type WASP were lysed with a buffer comprising 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 150 mM NaCl 0.5% Triton X-100 aprotinin (10 μg/ml) leupeptin (10 μg/ml) 1 mM PMSF 400 μM Na3VO4 400 μM EDTA 10 mM NaF and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate. The lysates were centrifuged at 20000×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris and the resulting supernatants were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with protein A—Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Cat# P9424 Sigma) conjugated with antibodies as indicated. The resulting immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with primary antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies to either mouse (Cat# 7076 Cell Signaling Technology) or rabbit (7074 Cell Signaling Technology) IgG. Immune complexes were detected with an ECL system (GE Healthcare Cat# RPN2232).

ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR

ChIP-sequencing: Three batches of 4 × 107 cells were cross-linked sonicated and immunoprecipitated as directed by the EZ-Magna ChIP™ HiSens Kit (17-10461 Merk Millipore). Briefly cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde (final concentration 1%) and sonicated using a Diagenode Bioruptor Pico programmed to 75 cycles 30” ON/30” OFF and vortexed 10 s each 25 cycles; Sonicated DNA sizes were verified by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. ChIP-grade protein A/G magnetic beads (20 µl/Rx) were washed and incubated for 2 h with 10 µg of WASP D-1 antibody (Cat# SC-5300 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4° C on a rotating platform. The chromatin (4 × 107 cells/Rx) was incubated with the antibody-coupled beads overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform. On a magnetic rack the beads were separated together with the linked DNA. To reverse cross-linking the immunoprecipitated samples and input controls (10 µL saved from the sonicated sample) were treated with RNase A and incubated on a thermomixer at 37 °C for 30 min; then Proteinase K was added and incubated at 65° C for 2 h followed by 95 °C for 15 min. DNA was extracted with the ChIP DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (D5205 Zymo Research). Three rounds of ChIP samples were pooled at 15 µL final volume (120 × 106 cells per cell line). Library preparation was performed using the MicroPlex Library Preparation Kit v2 (C05010012 diagenode). Library purification and size selection were performed using AMPure® XP Beads Beckman Coulter. The purified Library concentration was measured by Bioanalyzer analysis pooled at 2 nM and sequenced at paired-end 150 bp on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer. ChIP-Seq reads were mapped to hg38 by DNASTAR SeqMan NGen v2.5.1 with default parameters.

ChIP-qPCR: Two batches of cells (2.5 × 107 cells for each cell line) were cross-linked and sonicated as described above. The immunoprecipitations (1 × 107 cell equivalent/Rxn) were carried out using the EZ-Magna Kit or in according to Fujita and Fujii (2015) with the 5 µg α-H3K27ac (39133 Active Motif) antibody and 5 µg isotype control IgG (ab37415 Abcam). In all immunoprecipitations ChIP-grade protein A/G magnetic beads (20 µl/Rx) were washed and incubated for 2 h with 5 µg of antibody at 4 °C on a rotating platform. The chromatin was incubated with the antibody-coupled beads overnight at 4° C on a rotating platform. On a magnetic rack the beads were separated together with the cross-linked DNA. To reverse cross-linking the immunoprecipitated chromatin and input control were incubated on a thermomixer at 65 °C for 2 h followed by 95 °C for 15 min in elution buffer and the addition of Proteinase K. DNA was extracted with the ChIP DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (D5205 Zymo Research) and resuspended in 40 µl of Elution buffer each. For qPCR 0.25 µl of DNA was added per reaction using the SsoAdvanced™ Universal SYBR® Green Supermix (BioRad) on a CFX384 real-time PCR detection system (BioRad). The same protocol was applied for WASP ChIP-seq validation using 10 µg WASP D-1 antibody (Cat# SC-5300 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 10 µg isotype control IgG (ab91353 Abcam). All primers used are shown in Supplementary Data 5.

Flow cytometry

Cells were harvested and passed through a 70-µm strainer. The single cells were stained with antibodies against indicated cell surface markers and DAPI and then analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa cytometer or FACS Aria II cytometer. Cell sorting was performed by the flow cytometry core facilities of the Salk Institute and UCSD on a FACS Aria II cytometer or a BD Influx cytometer. Figures exemplifying the gating strategy are provided in Supplementary Data 7.

Small molecules

The following small molecules were used: sodium butyrate (Cat# 04-0005 Stemgent Lexington MA) working concentration: 0.25 mM. All drugs were dissolved in DMSO and used at concentrations as indicated.

Proteomic analyses

MudPIT: We suspect that the sensitivity and specificity of MS analysis might be confounded by the close association between WASP and the ubiquitous cytoskeletal components. To improve confidence in specificity we performed WAS co-IP in two independent B-lymphocyte lines each with two well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. We then filtered out peptides identified in the IgG co-IP or in the WASnull B-cell line by either of the two antibodies. To improve the detection of nuclear factors we repeated the MudPIT analysis with highly purified nuclei and identified high-confidence WASP-interacting polypeptides. Proteins associated with endogenous WASP were co-immunoprecipitated with two different monoclonal antibodies (sc-13139 Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 557773 BD Biosciences) against WASP from wild-type B lymphoblastoid cell lines using the Active Motif Universal Magnetic Co-IP Kit. Co-IP using mouse IgG in wild-type cells and co-IP using WASP antibodies in WASP mutant cells were used to discriminate against nonspecific proteins. To specifically immunoprecipitate WASP-interacting proteins in the nucleus nuclei were isolated using the Nuclei EZ Prep kit (Cat# NUC101 Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO) and processed as other co-IP experiments. The co-IP samples were subjected to MudPIT analysis as in refs. 808687. Briefly the immunoprecipitates were then eluted reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide (10 mM final concentration) and trypsinized. Upon completion of the digestion the proteins were desalted with a fused silica capillary desalting column and washed overnight. Following the desalting process a 100-μm internal diameter capillary consisting of a 10-μm laser pulled tip packed with 10 cm 3-μm Aqua C18 material (Phenomenex) was attached to the filter union (desalting column–filter union–analytical column) and the entire split-column was placed in line with an Agilent 1100 quaternary HPLC (Palo Alto CA) and analyzed using a modified 6-step separation88. Peptides eluted from the microcapillary column were electrosprayed directly into an LTQ 2-dimensional ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) with the application of a distal 2.4 kV spray voltage. A cycle of one full-scan mass spectrum (400–1400 m/z) followed by 8 data-dependent MS/MS spectra at a 35% normalized collision energy was repeated continuously throughout each step of the multidimensional separation. Application of mass spectrometer scan functions and HPLC solvent gradients were controlled by the Xcalibur data system. As each step was executed its spectra were recorded and poor-quality spectra were removed. MS/MS spectra remaining after filtering were searched with the SEQUEST algorithm against the NCBI RefSeq Human protein database concatenated to a decoy database in which the sequence for each entry in the original database was reversed. SEQUEST results were assembled and filtered using the DTASelect (version 2.0) program. DTASelect 2.0 uses a linear discriminant analysis to dynamically set XCorr and DeltaCN thresholds for the entire dataset to achieve a user-specified false-positive rate. The false-positive rates are estimated by the program from the number and quality of spectral matches to the decoy database.

Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS)

WT iMPs and WASP-KO-iMPs were harvested after 1-month differentiation with M-CSF and GM-CSF cytokines. About 2 × 106 macrophages were lysed in 500 µl RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail and were sheared by sonication on ice (Qsonica XL-2000 ultrasonic liquid processor US; 10 s per pulse 3 pulses 2-min interval time). The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by PierceTM BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher) after 14000×g centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C. A filter-aided sample preparation protocol8990 with modifications was used for the sample processing. Briefly the sample supernatant containing 10 µg total protein was mixed with 200 µl of 8 M urea in 0.1 M Tris/HCl (PH 8.5) in a Microcon-10kDa centrifugal filter unit (Millipore) and centrifuged at 14000×g for 40 min. The samples were digested by trypsin (enzyme to protein ratio 1:50) at 37°C overnight. The filtrates were desalted using Sep-Pak column C18 cartridges (Waters). Approximately 1.5 µg of peptide mixture per sample was injected in single technical replicates and an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled with an UltiMateTM 3000 UHPLC was used for DIA-MS analysis. A Spectronaut software against the Pan-Human library91 was applied for protein/peptide identification and quantification.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

KO-iMPs were transduced with 30 pmol siRNA targeting SRSF2 per million cells by RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher) and the same amount of non-targeting siRNA was transduced to both WT and KO-iMPs as control. After 24 h transfection the cells were harvested and seeded 100k/well in 24-well with 1 µg/ml LPS in the medium. The supernatant was collected after 8 h LPS treatment and centrifuged at 500×g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove any cell debris. The TNF concentration in the supernatant was measured by an ELISA kit (PeproTech Cat # 900-TM25) followed a standard protocol provided by the kit.

Microscale thermophoresis (MST)

His6-tagged SRSF2 were labeled with RED –tris-NTA dye in PBS-T buffer (Nano-Temper-technology) with a ratio 1:2 dye to protein. The reaction was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The interaction of SRSF2 with WASP was measured using MST instrument monolith NT.115 in premium coated capillaries supplied by Nano temper. The recombinant WASP purchased from Abnova (Cat # H00007454-P01) is a full-length protein (1-502 a.a.) with a GST tag at the N-terminus that was expressed in an in vitro wheat germ expression system and purified by the Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow method. A series of 10 µl reaction of 16 different concentrations from 90 pM to 3 µM of WASP were prepared. Each reaction was mixed with 10 µl of SRSF2 labeled with RED-Tris-NTA to obtain a final concentration of 1 nM. All reactions were done in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 10 mM MgCl2 100 mM KCl 0.1 mg/ml BSA 5% glycerol and 1 mM DTT). The fluorescent molecules were excited with a red laser (640 nm) to monitor the spatial distribution of the molecules in each capillary. The thermophoresis signals were measured in each capillary by a temperature gradient induced by an infrared (IR) laser with an emission wavelength of 1480 nm focused on a local defined sample volume. Upon heating the protein molecules diffused away from the peak of the temperature and bound and unbound proteins respond differently. The change in the thermophoresis of florescent molecules due to binding was plotted and used to calculate the bound protein fraction and the dissociation constant was obtained by fitting the results to a binding isotherm.

Expression and purification of recombinant human SRSF2

Human full-length SRSF2 (accession no. Q01130) N-terminally 8X histidine- and SUMO-tagged and C-terminus Strep-tagged E. coli optimized sequence was cloned into pET-24a by GenScript. SRSF2 plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) competent cells (Novagen) and colonies were selected on agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. SRSF2 was over-produced by growing the transformed cells in 10 L of 2YT media (Teknova) supplemented with kanamycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C to OD 600 of 0.8 and then induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated further for 19 h at 16 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5500×g for 10 min and resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 8) 700 mM NaCl 40 mM imidazole 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol 0.2% NP-40 1 mM PMSF 5% glycerol and EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet/50 ml (Roche UK)]. All further steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were lysed enzymatically by adding 2 mg/ml lysozyme and mechanically by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (22040×g 30 min) and the clear supernatant was directly loaded onto HisTrap HP 5 ml affinity column ((GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A [50 mM Tris (pH 8) 700 mM NaCl 40 mM imidazole 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 5% glycerol]. The column was then washed with ten column volumes (CVs) of buffer A followed by elution gradient with ten CVs using buffer B [50 mM Tris (pH 8) 500 mM NaCl 700 mM imidazole 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 5% glycerol]. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight in a dialysis buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 8) 300 mM NaCl 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol]. The dialyzed fractions were concentrated flash frozen and stored at −80 °C.

Sample preparation for RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq)

WT B cells and WASnull B (negative control) cells were harvested and 1 × 107 cells per sample were used for whole-cell RIP following a published protocol92 or nuclear fraction RIP following another published protocol93. For whole-cell RIP the cells were fixed with 0.1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature followed by adding 125 mM glycine for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 1 ml RIPA lysis buffer with freshly added 0.5 mM DTT 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC) and 100 U/ml RNaseOUT. After 10 min of incubation at 4 °C sonication was performed by 30 s on and 45 s off for total 10 min using Bioruptor®Pico (Diagenode). The samples were centrifuged at 10000×g for 10 min at 4 °C and mixed the supernatant with equal volume of RIP buffer (150 mM KCl 25 mM Tris-HCl (PH 7.5) 5 mM EDTA 0.5% NP-40 0.5 mM DTT 1× PIC and 100 U RNaseOUT. The 1% sample was saved as input and the rest was incubated with 6 µg WASP antibody (B9) for 2 hours at 4 °C and further incubated with 50 µl Dynabeads for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads twice using RIP buffer the beads were resuspended in 56 µl RNase-free water and 33 µl 3 x reverse cross-linking buffer (3×PBS 6% N-lauroyl sarcosine 30 mM EDTA 15 mM DTT) 10 µl proteinase K and 1 µl RNaseOUT followed by incubation at 42 °C and 55 °C for 1 h respectively. For the nucleation fraction RIP the nuclei were isolated using nuclear isolation buffer (1.28 M sucrose 40 mM Tris-HCl (PH 7.5) 20 mM MgCl 2  4% Triton X-100 1×PIC and 100 U/ml RNaseOUT) and resuspended in 1 ml RIP buffer with 1-h incubation at 4 ˚C. Sonication was performed by 30 s on and 45 s off for total 10 min using Bioruptor®Pico (Diagenode). After 13 000 rpm centrifugation for 10 min the supernatant was collected of which 1% was saved as input the rest incubated with 6 µg WASP antibody (B9) overnight at 4 °C and further incubated with 50 µl protein G-coated magnetic beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with RIP buffer low salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (PH 7.4) 150 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA 1% Triton 0.1% SDS) high-salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) 500 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA 1% Triton 0.1% SDS) low salt buffer high-salt buffer and RIP buffer. The beads from the final step of both whole-cell RIP and nuclear fraction RIP and input samples were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol followed by RNA purification. The Qubit Fluorometer was used for RNA concentration measurement and Bioanalyzer was used to determine RNA integrity prior to library preparation.

High-throughput whole transcriptome sequencing

RNA was isolated by Qiagen RNeasy kit with in-column DNase digestion. The Agilent TapeStation or Bioanalyzer was used to determine RNA integrity (RIN) numbers prior to library preparation. Stranded mRNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Cat# RS-122-2101 Illumina) or TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep Kit (Cat# RS-301-2001 Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly RNA with polyA tail was isolated using poly-T oligos conjugated to magnetic beads. mRNA was then fragmented and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. dUTPs were incorporated followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis. The dUTP-incorporated second strand was not amplified. cDNA was then end-repaired index adapter-ligated and PCR-amplified. Purification of nucleic acids after each enzymatic step was achieved by using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter).

Next-gen sequencing

mRNA Libraries were quantified pooled and sequenced at single-end 50 base pair (bp) using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 paired-end 75 bp using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform or paired-end 150 bp using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform at the Salk Next Generation Sequencing Core Lab the KAUST Bioscience Core Lab or the Novogene Co. Ltd. Raw sequencing data were demultiplexed and converted into FASTQ files using CASAVA (v1.8.2). Libraries were sequenced at an average depth of 50 million reads per library.

Bioinformatics analysis

Sequencing reads were aligned to the hg19 human genome using STAR (v2.5.1) (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/1/15/272537) with default parameters. Cuffdiff (v2.2.1) (https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2450) was used to analyze the differentially expressed (DE) genes and isoforms (-b -u—library-type fr-firstrand) on a pair-wise experiment design. A default cutoff of q-value < 0.05 was used to identify the DE genes. The spliced ratio was defined as the expression of one isoform over all isoforms of a specific gene under one condition. Isoforms with a difference in spliced ratio > 20% between two conditions and FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) > 5 in both conditions were identified as differentially spliced (DS) isoforms. Pathway analysis was performed using DAVID (v6.8) (1) where the list of DE genes/DS isoforms was used as input and the whole genome was used as background. As an alternative isoform expression analysis method we used STAR v2.5.3a to build a genome index from ENSEMBL GRCh38 human primary assembly. We augmented the index with the ENSEMBL annotation file release 90 through the—sjdbGTFfile command line parameter. The paired-end reads were then aligned using STAR v2.5.3a to the previously built human genome. Afterward we used the QC command of QoRT (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26187896) to generate counts for novel and annotated splice junctions based on the alignment files using the arguments (—stranded –runFunctions writeKnownSplices writeNovelSplices writeSpliceExon). Next we used the mergeNovelSplices command to aggregate the splice junctions and filter out low coverage (<10 normalized read coverage) novel splice junctions resulting in flat exon and splice junction count files for each sample. We used the previously generated flat count files as input for JunctionSeq (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27257077) to determine exon and splice junction differential usage. We followed the user manual to obtain the differentially used junctions and exons. Using the previously generated alignment files we obtained gene-level counts through htseq-count v0.6.0 part of the HTSeq framework (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25260700) based on ENSEMBL annotation file release 90 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899575). We then used DESeq2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516281) to obtain the differentially expressed genes following the standard workflow. The splicing pattern was visualized using IGV. Gene expression cluster analysis was conducted using Cluster 3.0 (https://www.encodeproject.org/software/cluster/) and Java TreeView (jtreeview.sourceforge.net/). Dendrogram on the heatmap represented the hierarchical clustering of the gene expression based on their correlation using the average linkage method in Cluster 3.0. GO term enrichment analysis was performed using ShinyGO v0.61 (http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/). Ingenuity-pathway analysis of the disease and function categories affected using RNA-seq data was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis/).

Skipped exon events were detected using rMATS (v4.0.1; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1419161111) by evaluating reads that were mapped to the splicing junctions and the “on target” exons. Each condition was tested using two replicates of paired-end 75 bp reads. To get the reads with a fixed length reads were pre-processed by cutadapt (v1.14; https://doi.org/10.14806/ej.17.1.200) to trim the first nucleotide (nt) off whenever necessary and aligned by STAR (v2.5.1) with default parameters and the soft-clipping option off. The resulted skipped exon events with >10% difference in splicing ratio and FDR < 0.05 were identified as significantly alternatively spliced (AS) exons.

Motif enrichment tests on the exons were performed using Homer (v4.8; PMID: 20513432). The RBPmap database94 containing motif information of 94 RNA binding proteins was used to scan the aberrant skipped exons of WASP-deficient cells and their upstream or downstream exons respectively. The motif lengths from 4 nt to 15 nt were tested for enrichment with respect to the background. Significantly enriched motifs were defined as motifs with hypergeometric P < 1e-2 greater than 5% enrichment in target sequences and fold-enrichment > 1.5.

R (http://www.R-project.org/) was used to generate graphs unless mentioned specifically. Venn diagrams were plotted using the R package VennDiagram (https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-35). ChIPpeakAnno package (https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-237) was used for the integrated analysis of the WASP ChIP-seq and AASEs.

Raw reads of RNA-seq data of B-cell lines were processed with FASTQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and BBDuk (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) in order to check the quality and remove low-quality bases and adapters. A minimum quality of 25 and a minimum read length of 35 nt were required. High-quality reads were then mapped against the Homo sapiens reference genome (NCBI GRCh38.p12) with STAR. FeatureCounts (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt656) were used to perform read summarization at the gene level only reads with quality higher than 30 were used. In addition strand-specific and paired-end modes were included. Statistical analyses and plots were generated with R. Lowly expressed genes were filtered out with the HTSFilter (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt350) package then a differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR. Genes with an FDR less or equal than 0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed. Differential Splicing Analysis was performed with the software RMATS using the trimmed reads as input for mapping. Only splicing events with an FDR < = 0.05 were considered differential.

Statistical analysis

Results are shown as mean ± SEM unless indicated otherwise. Comparisons were performed with two-sided Student’s t test or Mann–Whitney test if data are not normally distributed unless indicated otherwise.

Now as a fashion designer with his own eponymous brand he’s spent a considerable amount of time reflecting on the ways in which he experience the brand while living in both Atlanta and London through his adolescence.

In Atlanta he scooped classic 501s from Tractor Supply stores where farming supplies and power tools are probably the most sold items. In London he was met with refined Levi’s iterations at stores like Dover Street Market where the cheapest item is equivalent to two week’s pay for the typical person. He knows Levi’s as an innately American workwear brand but also an export a style-defining essential some folks only know as a fashion statement. Both consumer experiences informed his collaboration with the blue jean behemoth which drops on June 23rd via Levi’s online store.

Reese Cooper Reese Cooper

“You think of Levi’s as being cool like the classic 501” Cooper says. “But on the original back patch it calls out its durability with the rivets and canvas and denim. I just wanted to tie together the two main components the brand was built on. For me this was an opportunity to essentially make proper heritage workwear with a company that pioneered it.”

Cooper draws influences from several industries for his own collections: the outdoors streetwear and of course workwear. As such he says partnering with the original workwear brand is a dream come true especially since they gave him free rein to develop a collection that’s both new for Levi’s and cohesive with what he’s already release under his own umbrella.

Reese Cooper

“What we love so much about Reese is how he fuses traditional workwear materials and construction with modern style” Karyn Hillman Levi’s chief product officer says. “There’s a natural connection to our workwear lineage with a creative sustainable and fashion forward twist. This collection takes everything we love about the past and puts it into one beautiful modern package.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9uYXNodmlsbGUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA2LzI2L2FuZ2VsYS1jcmFuZS1qb25lcy1uYmljLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Women of Influence: Angela Crane-Jones Nashville Business Incubation Center - Nashville Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2022/06/26/angela-crane-jones-nbic.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9uYXNodmlsbGUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA2LzI2L2FuZ2VsYS1jcmFuZS1qb25lcy1uYmljLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb3Rvb2xyZXZpZXdzLmNvbS9ncmVlbndvcmtzLTYwdi1jb3JkbGVzcy0xMy1pbmNoLXRvcnFkcml2ZS1zdHJpbmctdHJpbW1lci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greenworks 60V Cordless 13-inch String Trimmer,"Conquer Lawn Day with the Greenworks 60V 13-inch Cordless String Trimmer

Having already been impressed with the Greenworks 60V line of cordless OPE we’re excited to get out hands on their more entry-level model to see how it compares. Now they take aim at homeowners with smaller lawns who are looking to ditch their outdated gas model with the Greenworks ST60B212 60V 13-inch cordless string trimmer.

Greenworks 60V Cordless 13-inch String Trimmer Performance

Despite its small cutting swath the Greenworks ST60B212 features its Torqdrive motor. Torqdrive delivers up to 7400 RPMs (that’s quick). It also produces 30% more power for tackling thicker grass and overgrowth. Greenworks specifically engineered this motor to provide that additional power and torque while allowing for quiet operation and longer motor life.

This string trimmer comes pre-spooled with 0.080-inch spiral twisted line. That’s a little on the lighter side but we typically find that size on residential trimmers. All it means is you may need to stop and bump the head a few more times while you’re working than you would with 0.095″ gauge (or heavier) line.

Speaking of line this model features Greenworks’ hassle-free Load N Go head. Loading line now only takes a matter of seconds without requiring disassembly. This lets you get back to trimming faster than with a traditional style trimmer head that requires disassembly.

Greenworks 60V Cordless 13-inch String Trimmer Design Notes

Size and Weight

The Greenworks ST60B212 weighs 7.38 pounds as a bare tool and 10.25 pounds with a 60V 2.0Ah battery. Being that this is a residential model using 0.080 line we hoped it would be a little lighter. Regardless the weight is nicely distributed since the motor and battery are on opposite ends of the string trimmer.

This cordless string trimmer measures 66.5 inches from tip to tail. Adjusting the front handle lets you dial in the ideal working angle for your height. I’m 6 feet tall and I had no problem finding a comfortable setup with this string trimmer.

Runtime

Greenworks tells just to expect up to 40 minutes of continuous runtime from a fully charged 2.0Ah battery. On Low our runtime test came back at 38 minutes and 49 seconds—pretty close to manufacturer specs! Kicking it into High gear it ran for 29 minutes and 41 seconds—pretty good for a residential trimmer. Considering this represents “trigger time” you should be able to trim up to a 1/2-acre property with this trimmer. It should provide plenty of time to make the rounds and keep your yard looking clean and crisp.

We tested using a 2.0 Ah Greenworks 60V battery

Ergonomics

Greenworks keeps the grip and trigger design pretty traditional. This 13-inch string trimmer has a beaver tail safety switch and a two-finger trigger to help reduce hand fatigue.

As I mentioned earlier the working angle is fully adjustable to fit what’s most comfortable for you.

Cutting Swath

The cutting swath is also adjustable from 11 inches to 13 inches. This gives you the flexibility needed for trimming in both larger areas and more confined spaces. Typically a smaller cutting diameter gives you additional runtime and power at the expense of your overall trim area.

2-Speed Gearbox

This trimmer features a 2-speed gearbox and a variable speed trigger for greater control. The Torqdrive motor spins the head up to 7000 RPM on Low and 7400 RPM on High. That’s a bit faster than some of the larger string trimmers and that extra speed makes up for the lower line mass.

Additional Features

The metal wire edge guide keeps the cutting path consistent

Greenworks 60V Cordless 13″ String Trimmer Price

The Greenworks ST60B212 kit retails for $199.99 at your local Tractor supply. The kit includes a single 60V 2.0Ah battery a 3-amp charger and a 4-year limited warranty.

The Bottom Line

Given its performance weight runtime and price we feel the Greenworks 60V 13-inch cordless string trimmer provides one of the best value string trimmers in the residential class. It has plenty of power for tackling all of your Saturday lawn chores. On top of that the low weight and great balance make it perfect for anyone looking for a more nimble trimmer. Since the tool runs on the Greenworks 60V platform you also get access to the rest of their lineup to help keep your yard looking great all season long.

Atlanta Financial Center which may be trading to Nightingale Properties.

New York-based Nightingale Properties has agreed to purchase the 915K SF glass-encased office complex straddling Georgia 400 for $182M in an off-market transaction Commercial Real Estate Direct reports. Sumitomo bought the property from Hines in 2016 for $222.5M and has since invested $15M to upgrade AFC during its ownership CRE Direct reported.

Nightingale is attempting to raise more than $76M in equity through the real estate crowdfunding platform CrowdStreet to purchase AFC.

“The investment offering presents a rare opportunity to acquire a trophy office at a steep discount because the seller is 'forced' and 'pressured' and needs to transact regardless of market conditions due to investor redemptions and upcoming loan maturity in Q2 2022” according to Nightingale's offering summary on CrowdStreet.

CrowdStreet investors would be part of a larger $330M capital stack that would include $185M in senior debt $60M in mezzanine debt and $8.5M in capital from Nightingale according to the offering.

“We acknowledge that there is an offering live in the marketplace"" CrowdStreet spokesperson Cary Brazeman said. ""But we don't comment on offerings that are in the marketplace.""

Nightingale officials didn't respond to Bisnow's request for comment.

Nightingale wrote in the offering it sees a big potential upside with the AFC despite recent setbacks including the effort for Buckhead to secede from Atlanta a move that threatened to chill economic development prospects.

The complex's five largest tenants have been at the property for an average of more than 30 years and current rents are lower than what tenants are paying in the market now according to the offering. Nightingale is underwriting $42 per SF or a 23.5% projected increase in rents with new leases.

Nightingale Senior Director of Acquisitions Will Hutton who led a webinar for the AFC offering on CrowdStreet told prospective investors that the current landlord already has 50K SF in letters of intent or offers to lease out with tenants. Truist is AFC's largest tenant at 265K SF followed by Morris Manning & Martin with 134K SF Starr Indemnity with 62K SF North American Electric Reliability Corp. with 59K SF and Foy & Associates with 49K SF according to offering documents. There is currently 196K SF of vacancy in the property.

“We don't even own the property yet and we're already seeing a lot of leasing activity” Hutton told prospective investors on the June 2 webinar. “We feel very well-insulated from any sort of uncertainty out there. Even if there's a recession and a little bit less rent growth we're still going to be cheaper than the competition” on rents.

The planned purchase comes on the heels of news that one of AFC's banner tenants Truist plans to move its securities division with 1000 employees to a new office development at The Battery Atlanta at Truist Park in Cobb County home of the Atlanta Braves. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution previously reported that Truist would anchor 250K SF in a new office building at the Battery.

Nightingale said in the offering that it negotiated a three-year lease extension with Truist giving the landlord time to pre-market the space once the banking giant moves out. Hutton said the nonprofit Hub404 Conservancy plans to develop Hub404 a capped park over Georgia 400 that will begin in front of AFC which could generate more interest and allow the landlord to push rents up to $50 or $60 per SF.

“The upside I wouldn't say is unlimited but it's very strong” Hutton said. “That's going to be a complete game-changer for all of Buckhead because that's going to be a mini High Line.”

Investment funds are due by July 8 according to CrowdStreet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53bHR4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9tbGIvZW1vdGlvbmFsLWZyZWRkaWUtZnJlZW1hbi1vdmF0aW9uLXJpbmctYXRsYW50YS1yZXR1cm4vMTAxLTA4NDdlMzcyLWZmMjEtNDZkZS1iZDc1LTM3YTI0OWM3OWFhZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Freddie Freeman's emotional return to Atlanta with Dodgers | wltx.com,"Freeman wasn't prepared for the flood of feelings that came in his anticipated return to Atlanta as a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

ATLANTA — Freddie Freeman expected to be emotional during his anticipated return to Atlanta.

He wasn't prepared for the flood of feelings — and tears — that came before his first game back as a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night.

A rush of them forced him to walk out of his pregame news conference before it began. Freeman had to gather himself several times when discussing his continued love for the Braves and Atlanta. He then questioned how he would make it through the three-game series.

“I don’t even know how I’m going to get through this weekend” Freeman said.

He was surprised how well he fared in the series opener. He reached base three times on two walks and a single and scored twice in the Dodgers’ 4-1 win.

“I did all right” he said. “I'll take three times on base and two runs scored. ... The best thing that happened was walking in that first at-bat.”

Receiving his 2021 World Series championship ring presented by Braves manager Brian Snitker in a pregame ceremony produced more emotions from Freeman. Following a tribute video to Freeman he made a slow walk to the field to join Snitker who stood beside the World Series trophy in front of the mound.

Braves fans stood and cheered some chanting “Freddie! Freddie!” Freeman answered by removing his cap and raising both arms to the fans. Freeman hugged Snitker twice including once after putting on his ring. He grinned and gave the ring a kiss.

Minutes later Freeman held up his batting helmet to the fans following another ovation before his first-inning at-bat. Braves right-hander Ian Anderson walked Freeman who later scored on a sacrifice fly by Justin Turner for a 2-0 lead. Freeman struck out in the second inning.

Freeman hit a homer in his first reunion game a 7-4 win over the Braves in Los Angeles on April 18.

Freeman the 2020 NL MVP led the Braves to their first World Series title since 1995 last season. He was widely expected to re-sign with Atlanta but instead signed a $162 million six-year deal with the Dodgers after he was unable to reach an agreement with the Braves.

After 15 years in the Braves’ organization including 12 years with Atlanta the 32-year-old has enjoyed a productive first half with the Dodgers. He was hitting .303 with eight homers and 45 RBIs entering Friday and is third in the NL All-Star voting among first basemen.

Atlanta’s Matt Olson acquired from the Oakland Athletics two days after losing Freeman is fourth in the voting.

Freeman constantly fought his emotions and didn’t make eye contact with Braves reporters through the opening minutes of his news conference.

“I can’t even look at you guys because I don’t know how I’m going to get through it” he said.

Even starting the news conference was difficult. When first entering the interview room Freeman said “give me a second” and then turned and left the room for several minutes.

After returning Freeman said “Man I love the Braves organization with all my heart. That will never change.”

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said he wasn’t surprised by Freeman’s declaration of his continued love for the Braves.

“I think it's something that Freddie long-awaited” Roberts said. “Everyone here adores him. I still know he'll be ready to play a baseball game.""

When he saw the large group of reporters before the game Snitker joked ""is something going on?”

Snitker has had other ring ceremonies for returning players including San Francisco’s Joc Pederson earlier this week.

“I’m happy just like I’m happy for all the guys we’ve given them to” Snitker said of Freeman.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydHNrZWVkYS5jb20vYmFzZWJhbGwvbmV3cy1kby1jYWxsLWJyYXZlcy1mYW4taGF0ZS1tYW4tb25jZS1icmF2ZS1hbHdheXMtYnJhdmUtYXRsYW50YS1icmF2ZXMtZmFucy13ZWxjb21lLWJhY2stZnJlZGRpZS1mcmVlbWFuLXRydWlzdC1wYXJrLWRlZmVuZGluZy1oYXRlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“Do not call yourself a Braves fan and hate on this man” “Once a Brave always a Brave” - Atlanta Braves fans welcome ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sportskeeda.com/baseball/news-do-call-braves-fan-hate-man-once-brave-always-brave-atlanta-braves-fans-welcome-back-freddie-freeman-truist-park-defending-haters on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydHNrZWVkYS5jb20vYmFzZWJhbGwvbmV3cy1kby1jYWxsLWJyYXZlcy1mYW4taGF0ZS1tYW4tb25jZS1icmF2ZS1hbHdheXMtYnJhdmUtYXRsYW50YS1icmF2ZXMtZmFucy13ZWxjb21lLWJhY2stZnJlZGRpZS1mcmVlbWFuLXRydWlzdC1wYXJrLWRlZmVuZGluZy1oYXRlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Why trust us?

Adding an app to every appliance in the house can get a little exhausting. While smart technologies like Matter will hopefully make things easier in the coming years for now all those apps can sometimes feel like unnecessary clutter. Not so with smart grills and smokers. If you don't already rely on a smart meat probe these grills benefit greatly from apps that allow you to monitor them from afar get suggestions for cooking new meats perfectly and much more.

If you’ve been looking for a grill upgrade you’ll love these app-friendly picks. It’s no surprise we’re starting with a Traeger model but we’ve included a variety of options for different budgets and summer plans.

Traeger Grills Ironwood 885

Smart grill with built-in meat probe

Pros Excellent pellet-based design

Great smart controls via app

Alexa support Cons If you're not familiar with wood pellet cooking it make take some getting used to

Traeger adds plenty of smart features to its famed wood pellet grill and the results are excellent. Use the tech to handle grilling smoking baking roasting braising and basic barbecue. The 885 square inches of grilling surface on this model make it suitable for even large backyard gatherings too.

The smart platform WiFIRE takes the grill to another level. Using the Traeger app you can control grill features from a distance including monitoring the built-in meat probe so you know the exact temperatures of your meats at any time. You can also adjust temperature levels and set timers on the app (there’s a separate controller if you would rather not add an app to your phone). It even comes with Alexa so you can call out commands to your grill while you are busy elsewhere.

The only real downside is that if you’ve never grilled or smoked with wood pellets before it will take a little learning to deal with the new fuel and it may be more expensive in your area than other fuel options.

Memphis Grills Elite Smoker and Grill

Super hot grill with a spacious cooking area

Pros Extra-large cooking surface

Convection fans

Can reach up to 700 degrees Fahrenheit

Suitable for some professional work Cons Very expensive

If you want the best of the best this wood pellet model can both grill and smoke and comes with excellent digital controls and software for full control … if you’re willing to pay the price. It’s also especially large with 1252 square inches of cooking surface making it suitable for anything from large family gatherings to some catering work (the 24-pound pellet hopper also ensures you can supply plenty of fuel). Direct and indirect cooking are both options thanks to the design.

Green Mountain Davy Crockett with Sense-Mate

Great grill for camping or tailgating

Pros Affordable and portable

Electric or wood pellet modes

App compatibility Cons Too small for some events

Looking for a more affordable grilling option that’s easier to take with you anywhere? You’ll love this electric/wood pellet grill that only weighs 68 pounds and comes with a foldable design that allows you to quickly store or transport it. Those features make the Davy Crockett a perfect accessory for tailgating but the smart technology only improves your options.

Weber Genesis SX-335

Best grill to up your grilling game

Pros Excellent gas grill design

App makes recommends on cooking stages

Large prep area Cons The plentiful smart features may be too many for some grillers

Are you more comfortable with a gas grill? This three-burner Weber model doesn’t just run on gas it’s also one of the smartest we’ve seen using an app to give you alerts when food reaches a certain temperature and reminders to make important temperature or placement changes (including when to flip your burgers or serve your meats). It includes both a large searing surface and a large prep surface so you can do plenty of ingredient work right there at the grill.

Weber’s design also allows for a wide variety of accessories if you’re willing to purchase them. You can fit in grillware that allows you to bake steam stir-fry and more — essentially turning it into your own outdoor kitchen.

Traeger Grills Pro Series 575

Good for smaller spaces

Pros A more affordable Traeger model

App and Alexa support

Still has 575 square inches of grill space Cons May not be large enough for every user

If you’re a big fan of Traegers but want to save some money this smaller and much more affordable version still provides many of the same benefits. Smart features include app connectivity to monitor the grill and control temperatures as well as Alexa integration for giving your grill voice commands.

As the name indicates you have 575 square inches of grill space. That’s not as big as many of our picks but it’s still plenty of space for managing meats for a party or a family gathering. The grill can reach up to 500 degrees max temperature and a built-in probe is also included here.

Traeger Grills Pro Series 575 Good for smaller spaces

Masterbuilt Smoker MB20071117

A solid option for those new to smoking meats

Pros Affordable smoker

Large enough for two turkeys

Wood chip side loader Cons A good beginner model but lacking in smart features

Primarily interested in smoking meats? This affordable smoker is an excellent place to get started. At 30 inches it’s not the largest model but there’s still plenty of room to hold up to two turkeys or four racks of ribs etc. The electric features mean that temperature control can be very accurate and the insulation keeps the heat in so you don’t have to worry about making spaces too hot (the smoker also has optional covers and leg extensions depending on your setup). There is also a side-loading system for adding wood chips without dissipating heat.

Masterbuilt Smoker MB20071117 A solid option for those new to smoking meats More

Masterbuilt Smoker MB20074719

High-end smart smoker

Pros Bluetooth and app support

Meat thermometer

40-inch design Cons May be too expensive for beginners

If you’re more serious about your smoker this model is a significant upgrade. It’s a 40-inch smoker that offers four chrome-coated racks to hold all kinds of meats. It also comes equipped with more smart features including a meat probe thermometer and a Bluetooth connection that works with an app on your phone to help you monitor smoking conditions more accurately. Like our other Masterbuilt it also has a side loader for wood chips.

Frequently Asked Questions

What is a smart grill? A smart grill is typically a grill that comes with more advanced digital features for monitoring and control especially app compatibility or voice assistant compatibility. How much is a smart grill? You can find a smart for both well below and well above $1000. A full-featured large smart grill will probably be around $1500. What do Wi-Fi grills do? The grill connects to a Wi-Fi network which allows it to interact with apps on your mobile devices. You can use the apps to monitor temperatures and control the grill from a distance as well as get alerts or timers. Some grills use Bluetooth connections instead of Wi-Fi but the result is largely the same. Which home grill is best? The best grill for you really depends on your situation. We suggest you should start thinking about size (surface cooking area how many people you cook for etc.) and then what fuels you would prefer. Smart features can come later. Our reviews like that of the Weber Genesis can help you make decisions too.

LIVINGSTON Calif. — After more than 80 years Foster Farms is owned by someone other than the Foster family. At the helm now is Atlas Holdings and Donnie Smith a former Tyson CEO who says he's still got a lot of listening to do before establishing a vision for the company.

""You really don't understand why things happen or exactly what's happening until you're actually out here on the ground meeting with people and asking questions and having them tell you what they do how they do it and why they do it that way"" Smith told ABC10.

Despite his extensive experience in the food business Smith said his first objective is to listen.

“I think it's really important that I not bring any preconceived ideas about how to best help the Foster Farms team from any past experience” Smith said.

Industry expert and head of the California Poultry Federation Bill Mattos described Smith as a rock star in the poultry business and was confident that the new leadership team would hit the ground running.

However when it comes to the strategy for Foster Farms Smith said that will come in due time. Nonetheless one thing he's already certain about is that no one has to fear for their job because of the company's sale.

“There’s no reason for anybody working with the company to fear (for) their job” Smith said.

Foster Farms is a top employer in Stanislaus County. It's also considered a ""golden brand"" and the largest poultry business on the West Coast according to Mattos.

Even when Smith was CEO of Tyson he acknowledged that Foster Farms was had some serious strength and an enviable position on the West Coast. He actually came out of retirement in order to take the helm at Foster Farms.

""There were very few opportunities that would cause me to frankly get out of what was a deliriously happy retirement. I had a very fulfilling retirement but for me this was such an intriguing and such a phenomenal opportunity for me... I just couldn't say no.""

While Mattos refers to Smith as a rock star Smith himself prefers to view himself as a ""pretty simple guy."" He grew up with the food industry working with Tyson learning about prepared foods and learning about the pork and beef businesses as well.

""I have a deep passion for people. I have a deep passion for creating great food I have a deep passion for taking care of hungry hungry people. And just look I love people"" Smith said.

Smith said his attention is more focused on making the Foster team a fluid one and keeping his employees safe adding that he'll leave the product ideas to the experts. For now he said people should expect what they've come to expect of the Foster Farms brand.

""No immediate changes in mind for the product mix. I've always... looked West and with a great deal of admiration about the business that the Foster family has developed out here and have always admired their their presence on the shelf have always admired the quality of their food - I've always admired their great tasting products and all that will continue"" Smith said.

Do you love bacon so much you want to smell like it – without the hassle of actually cooking?

A new bacon-scented fragrance from Tyson-owned Wright Brand might just be right for you. The scent named Wright N°100 was released on Thursday to celebrate the brand’s 100th year anniversary according to a press release from Wright.

True bacon fiends can purchase the meaty fragrance for $19.22 at Wright100.com.

The gender-neutral scent was created in collaboration with Ann Gottlieb who has helped develop fragrances for clients like Britney Spears Victoria’s Secret and Calvin Klein. The scent isn’t pure bacon: Wright N°100 features notes of bacon applewood bergamot white patchouli sandalwood and maple syrup according to the release.

“We only turn 100 once and with that in mind we wanted to create something unique and special to help consumers celebrate our centennial anniversary with us” said Cal Tharp senior brand manager for Wright Brand in an email to CNN. “Not to mention there are few things more addictive than the smell of bacon cooking (in the oven– that’s our recommended preparation).”

“One of the things that makes Wright Brand bacon special is that it’s real wood-smoked so we thought why not bottle up our signature real wood-smoked aroma to expand the sensory experience of our bacon” Tharp said.

The scent also features a note of Mousse de Saxe a combination of leather and vanilla popular in 1922 as a nod to the brand’s founding year.

Wright Brand was launched in 1922 in Vernon Texas and was acquired by Tyson Foods corporation in 2001.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzI1L2tlZXAteW91ci1waG90b3Mtc2FmZS13aXRoLXRoaXMtYXV0b21hdGljLWZpbGUtYmFja3VwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keep your photos safe with this automatic file backup,"Discover startups services products and more from our partner StackCommerce.

It’s not too hard to protect a photo album. You can hold it show it off and put it in a safe place when you’re done. Your digital photos and important files are a little different. They might be just as important but knowing how to protect them can be a little more complicated. Sure you could store the phone your pictures are on but one of the only ways to protect your photos and still be able to see them is with an online cloud storage. Degoo Premium Mega Backup Plan: Lifetime Subscription can safely store your family photos essential documents and so much more without locking it out of your reach. For a limited time this simple cloud storage is on sale for $119.99 (Reg. $4320) with code DEGOO.

One of the toughest parts of keeping your files safe is that you never know when you actually need to store them. You can’t predict your phone getting stolen even if thousands are getting taken every year. That’s why Degoo automatically stores your files for you.

The way it works is that Degoo can automatically detect when files have changed on your device. It’ll sync up and upload the new files so you don’t have to. That also doesn’t mean every time you take a picture it’s siphoned off to parts unknown. Degoo only takes a copy. So if you snap a photo on vacation it’ll be uploaded safely by the time you get home.

And if you want to share your digital stuff it’s simple. You can send files through email link or use your favorite messaging app. You also don’t really have to worry about Degoo filling up. This subscription gives you 15TB which is more than Dropbox OneDrive and Google Drive combined. All of this is protected by a 256-bit AES encryption. One of the most common ways hackers try to break into files is through a process called “brute forcing” but it would take one of their programs over a million years to crack this encryption. By that time you probably won’t be as concerned.

Protect your photos and files with a digital backup that does the work for you. For a limited time you can get Degoo Premium Mega Backup Plan: Lifetime Subscription on sale for $119.99 (Reg. $4320) with code DEGOO.

An estimated 175000 fish along the river died.

""No turtles were sliding off into the water. There were very few birds"" said Sipsey Resident Connie Rowe.

Communities along the river suffered. Fishing boating and recreational activities were deemed unsafe.

""It was for a long period of time"" Rowe said.

Tyson Foods allegedly dumped thousands of gallons of illegal wastewater into the tributary in 2019.

""It hurt a lot of people catching fish until that got straightened out"" said Colony Mayor Curtis Johnson.

Attorney General Steve Marshall settled a lawsuit against Tyson Foods for $3 million last year. $2 million is going to the communities impacted.



""It was devastating to them and it was recovering but we're glad to have these amenities that will help them going forward"" said Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Deputy Commissioner Ed Poolos.

The five-member board in charge of those funds announced Saturday several projects that would be happening in Cullman and Walker counties. The town of Sipsey gets a bigger parking lot fishing dock restrooms and a pavilion.

""It's a fantastic thing"" Rowe said. ""It's going to have an opportunity for people who are physically limited to have the ability to fish here probably fished for many many years before having to do so.""

The Town of Colony finally will get a parking lot and pathway to the river. Gwendolyn Purifoy owns the property where the walkway and parking lot will be built.

Paying down debt is always an important step to take but when a recession looms doing so holds even more power than you might think. ""In general recessions are characterized by lower economic growth and higher uncertainty. Since both of these things typically cause higher unemployment and lower income recessions make us defensive in the way that we think about money reducing our spending and driving us to protect our savings"" says Katherine Salisbury co-founder of Qapital a popular finance app. ""Jobs and business income are in greater jeopardy and we try to give ourselves greater slack so that we can be prepared for a variety of negative outcomes."" Select asked Salisbury to weigh in on the reasons why financial experts say to pay down debt in order to prepare for a recession.

You'll have more credit available for tricky situations

Recessions often seem like a slippery slope since so much can be up in the air including your employment status and how much you'll be able to earn. If you don't have an emergency fund — or don't have enough money saved up in one yet — you might end up incurring more debt by turning to credit cards to pay for the things you need. That's why it's important to make sure you have as much money available as possible just in case. ""Experts recommend paying down debts (and not taking on new ones) because no one wants to be caught with mounting interest payments in the event of an emergency salary setback or job loss"" says Salisbury. ""Carrying outstanding debt means that the balance also decreases your available access to cash for future setbacks."" The more of an available balance you have the less likely you'll be to max out your credit card if you do need to use it to float the costs of some expenses for a little while. In this case your credit card would buy you some flexibility. ""Let's say you have a $10000 limit on you credit card and carry an $8000 balance when your car breaks down and needs an engine overhaul"" Salisbury explains. ""Mechanics are short and there are supply chain shocks overseas where the parts are manufactured. This means that prices have gone up 20% since you bought the car. The total bill will run you $2500 more than you expected putting you over your credit limit.""

You could avoid having to pay higher interest rates

""Sometimes recessions coincide with rising interest rates like the one we're seeing now"" says Salisbury. ""In that case if you carry any debt with a variable interest rate then you'll see your costs increase at just the moment it hurts the most."" If you have a personal loan with an adjustable interest rate for example you could be charged a higher interest rate which means your monthly payment would increase. The same scenario is also true if you have an adjustable-rate mortgage and the fixed-rate period is about to end or is already over. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau credit card companies can actually increase your interest rate on new transactions as long as they provide a 45-day notice and a few other conditions are met: If your temporary interest rate has expired — if you have a credit card with a 0% intro APR offer for instance — if you have a variable interest rate on your credit card or if your minimum payment has not been received within 60 days of its due date. While the new higher interest rate wouldn't apply to your existing balance it could still make new transactions even more expensive and add to your overall debt.

You may not have to seek out other sources of credit

""Recessions also mean that access to new debt either through bank loans or credit cards can become scarce"" says Salisbury. ""Lenders also become risk averse during lean times just like consumers become cautious. This means that it will probably be harder to get a loan and it will likely carry a higher interest rate if you do obtain one."" For this reason Salisbury asserts that it's important to do what you can now to reduce your debt usage. Stern lenders will be more likely to approve you for new lines of credit if they see you as a more creditworthy borrower — and reducing your debt balances is an important part of this.

""Leverage psychological principles like delayed rewards to promise yourself little treats for hitting intermediate payment milestones"" Salisbury says. ""You might take yourself out for a decadent dessert or purchase a new t-shirt that you've been eyeing after sticking with your debt pay down plan for three months. Recessions may be lean times but they aren't the end of the world. We all deserve some joy and optimism even when the economy isn't as healthy as we'd like it to be.""

If you're looking for a low-risk approach to 'buy the dip' this big banking bet is worth copying

The Oracle of Omaha has had a busy quarter.

According to his latest 13F filing Warren Buffett has deployed roughly one-third of his cash into new investments during the first three months of the year.

As always Buffett’s biggest swings are noteworthy. However his decision to sell most bank stocks while adding Citigroup (C) to Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK) portfolio is puzzling Wall Street.

Here’s why this contradiction has caught so much attention.

Warren Buffett likes these 2 investment opportunities outside of the stock market

Buffett loves banks

Buffett is deeply familiar with banking and financial services. He believes the business is relatively straightforward and can be extremely lucrative if managed well.

“If you can just stay away from following the fads and really making a lot of bad loans banking has been a remarkably good business in this country” he told Berkshire Hathaway investors in 2003.

What about the 2008 Global Financial Crisis? Buffett went on a shopping spree during that time picking up stakes in JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).

For several years major banks have been the biggest holdings in the Berkshire portfolio. In 2009 he even said Wells Fargo (WFC) was his highest-conviction investment.

“If I had to put all my net worth in one stock that would’ve been the stock” he told Berkshire shareholders.

Catching Buffett on the rebound

This year Buffett has completely exited all these investments. Only a few banks remain in the portfolio.

That doesn’t mean the love affair with financial services is over.

In fact Buffett added a new bank to his collection this year: Citigroup. During the first quarter of 2022 he added 55 million shares of Citigroup to the Berkshire portfolio.

The stake is now worth $2.5 billion making it the 16th largest holding in the basket.

The bet seems to be predicated on a turnaround story.

Citigroup’s transformation

Citigroup has lagged behind its peers. Over the past five years the stock is down over 28%.

Compare that to Bank of America’s 33% return over the same period. Even the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) is up 3%.

The company is now attempting a turnaround to catch up. Last year Citigroup’s board appointed Jane Fraser as the new CEO — making her the first female leader of a major U.S. bank.

Fraser's strategy involves focusing on the more profitable segments of the business. Citigroup is selling or shutting down operations in Mexico Australia Philippines South Korea and elsewhere.

Story continues

Citi stock hasn’t fully reflected this new strategy.

An undervalued opportunity?

Citigroup stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 5.5. Its price-to-book ratio is 0.5. That’s significantly lower than the industry average of 9.5 and 1.1 respectively.

Put simply the stock is cheap.

If the new management team can streamline operations and boost profitability the bank’s valuation could catch up with peers.

Meanwhile a rising interest rate environment should provide another tailwind.

Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo council recently passed a new bylaw that would allow rideshare services like Uber to operate in Fort McMurray.

But Uber spokesperson Keerthana Rang said in an email that although Uber was consulted when the municipality was making its bylaw the company doesn't support the bylaw.

""Unfortunately the bylaw has additional red tape high costs for individual drivers and privacy concerns"" wrote Rang.

She said the decision to open in any region depends on market conditions and local regulations.

""Keeping those conditions in mind it is highly unlikely that the platform will launch under the current bylaw"" wrote Rang.

The bylaw requires mandatory cameras in each vehicle but Uber thinks it's invasive to require that in personal vehicles and other Canadian cities don't require cameras for rideshare services said Rang.

There are also two fees for drivers to get started totalling $670 which could be a costly barrier for new drivers said Rang.

The municipality also requires that Uber have a physical office. But Rang said Uber offers 24/7 virtual support and having an office in each municipality isn't realistic.

Coun. Funky Banjoko said Uber could partner with a local business to satisfy the office requirement.

""I don't see this as a big big deal that would stop a big company like Uber"" said Banjoko.

In general Banjoko said the municipality wants to reduce red tape but the rules in place are to ensure quality service that will protect the safety of drivers and residents.

Banjoko said she thinks having cameras in vehicles is important for safety and the fees the municipality is charging for new drivers are comparable to other large cities.

""I don't think we are outrageous"" Banjoko said.

Banjoko said the requirements for taxi drivers and rideshare drivers are the same because the municipality wants an even playing field.

Funky Banjoko proposed the original motion to review the community's taxi bylaws. (Submitted by Funky Banjoko)

Abdi Mursal owner of YMM Rider said he's relieved to hear that Uber isn't likely to come to the community as he's starting a Fort McMurray rideshare app.

""That's really good news for us as a small company"" said Mursal.

He said he agreed that bylaws add a lot of cost to new drivers and said it can cost up to $3000 with a vehicle-for-hire licence camera installation vehicle inspection and repairs.

The cost has been a roadblock hiring part-time or casual employees said Mursal.

Terena Gunderson a 20-year Fort McMurray resident said she doesn't feel safe getting into cabs in town and she was hoping Uber would start up in the community.

She said she likes knowing who the driver is and having a GPS tracker.

""I know where they're going because I can watch it.""

""I never use a cab anywhere"" Gunderson said.

She added that she is in favour of having mandatory cameras for safety but she wants to see the bylaw reworked so the rideshare companies will operate in the region.

""I just really hope Fort McMurray can get with the times move forward and stop giving red tape to everything that wants to come into town"" said Gunderson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vY2FtcGFpZ25icmllZi5jb20vc3BlY2lhbC1hdXN0cmFsaWEtdS1zLXNjb3Jlcy1vbmUtYnJvbnplLWxpb24taW4tdGhlLWZpbG0tbGlvbnMtZm9yLXViZXItZWF0cy11YmVyLWRvbnQtZWF0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Special Australia/U.S. scores Bronze Lion in the Film Lions for Uber Eats 'Uber Don't Eats'; Apple / Smuggler win Grand ...,"| BY Ricki Green |

The actor and entrepreneur is launching product in the U.K. in an exclusive partnership with Boots starting on Wednesday. For Ross the move was a natural extension of her accessible vision for textured hair care.

“The original dream for the brand was to be a global brand because I believe that the curly and textured community is one that spans across the globe” she told WWD. “I wanted to expand that mission so that everybody has access to their most beautiful and healthy hair.”

Boots made an ideal partner for the brand given its broad footprint. “85 percent of the U.K. population is within 10 minutes of a Boots store” she added.

Although parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance is considering selling Boots as it refocuses its health care business in the U.S. WWD reported that sales in Boots grew double-digits due to increased foot traffic earlier this year.

For the Pattern’s future Ross hasn’t ruled out any other geographies especially given the brand’s success at Ulta Beauty and Sephora she noted. “Africa is a place I’d like to expand to. I would like Pattern to be everywhere because I believe that we are everywhere” Ross said. “We will keep going from there.”

It all ladders up to Ross’ goal to bring innovation and information to Pattern’s consumers. “The brand was born out of my own personal hair care journey and my experiences brought me into a community of people that were like me becoming their own best experts” she said.

“Part of why I’m proud of how well Pattern is doing is that we’re going across the pond to bring that knowledge and information” she continued.

Ross referenced a recent McKinsey & Co. survey she partnered with the firm on called “Black representation in the beauty industry” which quantifies those disparities. Black-owned brands are only 2.5 percent of total beauty revenue per the survey despite Black consumers accounting for 11.1 percent of beauty spending. Black consumers are also three times more likely to not find adequate skin care hair care or makeup options.

That vision hasn’t come without its learnings though. “I’m the CEO and founder and I’m majority owner of the company with full creative control. My hands are on everything” she said. “One thing I didn’t know before was how much goes into product: the marketing the language on the packaging sustainability all of the regulations shifting.”

On the product side Ross has been busy. “I’m in product mode” she said. “We do our [product] drops in a very staggered way. They’re happening on a regular basis and so there are a few very big launches that are going to happen.”

The Joint Venture Agreement (JV) between Delta Air Lines and LATAM Airlines Group received provisional approval and antitrust immunity from the Department of Transportation (DOT) on Thursday. The US Tentatively Approves Delta-LATAM JV.



Delta-LATAM JVA approved – kinda.

The DOT believes the Delta-LATAM JV will likely generate public benefits while the US-South America market would remain sufficiently open to existing and new competition. Nonetheless it has placed certain conditions on final antitrust immunity.

The DOT said: “the Department proposes the following critical remedies and conditions to address these issues: maintenance of current third-party interline agreements the removal of exclusivity provisions a 10-year expiration and reassessment requirement and the removal of a capacity constraint clause located in the joint venture agreement which artificially limits growth during the initial stages of the proposed relationship.”

The two parties now have 14 days to respond to the tentative decision. In a joint statement the airlines said:

“LATAM Group and Delta Air Lines welcome the US Department of Transportation’s (DOT) preliminary decision to approve their US/Canada-South America (Brazil Chile Colombia Paraguay Peru and Uruguay) Joint Venture agreement which will significantly enhance travel options for customers traveling between the two regions. Once the DOT confirms its decision the airlines will work to deepen their strategic alliance enabling them to offer consumer benefits including increased flight availability more routes between the US/Canada and South America enhanced frequent flyer benefits as well as access to shared facilities and services at the airports where the airlines operate.”

A closer look at Delta and LATAM’s JV

Both companies announced they would file for a Joint Venture Agreement in 2020. This JV would allow them to plan price and share revenues and costs covering routes between the United States and Canada on one end and the South American region on the other. It would also allow them to compete better against American Airlines and United Airlines which already have partnerships with Latin American carriers such as GOL JetSMART and Copa Airlines.

The proposed JV is an incremental profit and loss-sharing alliance that provides for metal

neutrality between the carriers and covers all nonstop flights between North America and the South American regions as well as flights connecting to the nonstop services that operate within the geographic scope of the proposed JV.

According to the two airlines the JV will:

Cover 7000 city-pair markets;

Provide new or expanded service on at least 18 nonstop routes;

Provide approximately $460 million in estimated annual consumer benefits;

Optimize connectivity between Delta’s and LATAM’s hub networks;

Lower prices by jointly setting fares and managing seat inventory by up to $56 million annually;

Create an immunized network that provides critical mass to compete against the larger American Airlines and United Airlines networks in the region; and

Use efficiencies of the combined operations to optimize aircraft utilization enhance schedules and lower costs with a joint sales force to target key customers.

The benefits

With the JV in place Delta and LATAM estimate they will attract 1000000 more annual U.S.-South America passengers that would have otherwise flown on competing carriers. They estimate capacity will increase more than 68% once demand conditions return to pre-pandemic normal levels.

Both carriers’ networks are largely complementary and the only route overlap exists in the New York-Sao Paulo city-pair market. LATAM and Delta proposed new reinstated or expanded services on at least 18 routes.

Moreover if the JV is approved LATAM will have increased access to North American markets over Delta’s Atlanta Boston Los Angeles and New York City hubs and Delta will have increased access to over 160 South American markets over LATAM’s hubs at Bogota Lima Santiago and Sao Paulo.

The acquisition which was made jointly with GS Energy an EV charging station operator and GS Neotek an IT provider will allow LG to take advantage of future business opportunities the company said.

“The EV charging market is expected to grow rapidly due to the surging demand for more eco-friendly vehicles” said Paik Ki-mun senior vice president of LG Electronics in a statement. “Leveraging our know-how and experience in the B2B sector we will offer customized integrated vehicle charging solutions for diverse customers enhancing the competitiveness of our existing and ensuring our readiness for future opportunities.”

LG Electronics acquired a 60% stake while GS Energy and GS Neotek took over 34% and 6% respectively in AppleMango which will become a subsidiary of LG Electronics following the deal. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. According to a local media report the acquisition size is estimated at $7.8 million (10 billion KRW).

The move comes nearly a year after LG Electronics shut down its loss-making mobile business to focus on its growth areas such as electric vehicles the internet of things (IoT) and B2B solutions.

LG Electronics is poised to leverage its expertise creating user-friendly interfaces to make the EV charging experience in South Korea a pleasant and easy one for drivers. Additionally by moving into the EV charging business LG can create more synergy between its EV battery development energy storage systems energy management solutions and chargers the company said.

The tech giant plans to set up an EV charger production line at LG Digital Park in South Korea by the end of this year aiming to provide customized EV charging solutions for private residences shopping malls hotels and public institutions. While LG did not say whether it intends to continue selling AppleMango’s chargers the acquired company brings to the deal a wide range of EV charging solution technologies from slow chargers to rapid chargers for residential and business use.

LG Electronics entered the EV industry in 2013 by setting up the LG Vehicle Component Solutions company. It also acquired Austria-based automotive lighting company ZKW in 2018 to expand its EV business. It formed a joint venture with Magna International in December 2020 to manufacture e-motors inverters and onboard charges.",,,,,,,,,

Public health specialists and advisors to the World Health Organisation Asian Development Bank and World Bank came together at the Commonwealth People’s Forum in Kigali Rwanda to discuss how the coalition of 54 Commonwealth member states can advance health justice.

It’s the first time Commonwealth civil society has convened in four years at this scale owing to the pandemic with the discussion spanning improving solidarity between Commonwealth countries and pandemic preparedness.

In particular advocates agreed on next steps for tackling global health emergencies focusing on progressive taxation as vital to achieving universal health coverage:

Resilient health systems

Dr Ravi Rannan-Eliya a Sri Lankan physician and economist and consultant for both the World Bank and Asian Development Bank said:

""In most Commonwealth countries we don't have insurance we rely on taxation.…We have to get the well-off to pay more in taxes…And you can't build resilient health systems unless you use public financing. That means government taxation or mandatory social insurance which requires government intervention. Why is this a solidarity issue? It's a solidarity issue because both those things require you to take money from the better off to provide services for the vulnerable.""

Dr Justice Koonin Australian HIV advocate and co-chair of the Universal Health Coverage 2030 campaign group agreed and added that civil society must play an advocacy role to ensure marginalised groups aren’t left behind:

""There's a statement in the 2019 WHO declaration calling for all governments to increase public health spending on primary health care by 1% of GDP — that's the bare minimum. And this must be achieved through progressive taxation. It's difficult politically but that's why civil society needs to be there. Because universal health coverage isn't universal health coverage if it doesn't apply to prisoners and refugees if we're not talking about LGBT people. If we provide health care services to everyone else but not those people that's not universal health coverage.""

Civil society

Professor Senait Fisseha Chief Advisor to the WHO Director-General world-renowned physician and leader in reproductive health and rights from Ethiopia explained what’s at stake if public financing of healthcare systems isn’t prioritised in the Commonwealth:

'""The global system failed people especially vulnerable marginalised communities. People in sub-Saharan Africa were scrambling for vaccines. So governments do need to prioritise healthcare investments. The Abuja declaration was for African nations to increase 15% of our GDP into health. Only two countries in sub-Saharan Africa Rwanda and South Africa have done that. Many of us are investing very small amounts. So there’s a question of how do we increase domestic resources to ensure we have a very strong primary health care system.""

Dr Ravi Rannan-Eliya gave an example of how to achieve this citing an example of when the UK public resoundingly supported higher taxation to make their National Health System stronger in the midst of a global recession and at a time when spending was frozen.

He adds this was driven by civil society — with the British Medical Association and other health unions undertaking strategic polling of voters and taking this evidence to the UK government.

""Healthcare spending was the only item of the budget that was increased [by the UK government] at that time. So this is an example of civil society at its best. That's what I would call for in your own country.’""

He made the suggestion following reports that most hospital admissions consisted of patients with chronic ailments who were unable to undergo checkups at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under Republic Act No. 11223 or the UHC Act Filipinos can access comprehensive primary healthcare services such as consultation diagnostic tests and case management the senator said.

He urged the government to hasten the implementation of the law and the rollout of the Konsultasyong Sulit at Tama (Konsulta) Package by Philippine Health Insurance Corp.

The Konsulta package Angara said covers individual-based health services including initial and follow-up primary care consultations health screening and assessment and access to selected diagnostic services and medicines.

They came to protest the Supreme Court overturning Roe v Wade. KLCC was there.

Tiffany Eckert / KLCC Crowds grew and grew in Eugene as abortion rights advocates called on people to fight patriarchy racisim sexism homophobia and keep protecting the basic right to privacy and bodily autonomy.

The honks of support at times drown out the chanting crowd. Many hoist signs with messages like “Keep your theology off my biology.”

Tiffany Eckert / KLCC Women and men teens and children attended the rally organized by Planned Parenthood. Some protesters wore pink Planned Parenthood apparel or homemade shirts with pro-choice messages.

54-year old Cheryl Ernst waves a coat hanger a symbol of dangerous pre-Roe abortions. She hopes the use of the metal hanger as a protest prop is not lost on anyone. We are going backward she said.

Tiffany Eckert / KLCC At the Planned Parenthood rally Cherl Ernst and her daughter Sinikka Edelen carry coat hangers a terrifying symbol of pre-Roe abortions that often resulted in death.

“We live in a society where now abortion is going to be illegal in a majority of the U.S"" she said. ""And we do not have universal health care women are going to be forced to have children that they don’t necessarily want we have an inadequate adoption system. This is not about abortion. This is about controlling women’s bodies and not giving women access to the health care that they need.”

Tiffany Eckert / KLCC Congressional candidate Val Hoyle told the raucous crowd when she heard the news of the SCOTUS decision Friday morning she felt ""gut punched.""

Congressional candidate Val Hoyle warned that the dissolution of privacy rights won’t stop here. She said Justice Clarence Thomas made it clear “they are going to come after gay marriage and birth control” next.

In addition to the local politician representatives from Planned Parenthood and community activists spoke out to an ever-growing crowd. Poet and activist Paris Woodward-Ganz read a poem which ended with ""hell hath no fury like a women scorned.""

Woodward-Ganz was reportedly arrested several hours later while marching through the streets of downtown Eugene in a protest named ""Night of Rage."" EPD has confirmed ""less lethal non-chemical munitions"" called pepperballs were deployed to disperse a crowd of about 75 protesters heading toward a controversial pregnancy counseling/services business Dove Medical Clinic on East 11th Avenue.

At least ten protesters were arrested by EPD for disorderly conduct and/or resisting arrest. Sources say all were released by 2pm Sunday.

Wade on Saturday June 25 2022.

More than 200 protesters gathered to rally for abortion rights in Provo on Saturday a day after the U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.

Provo — the home of Brigham Young University operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — isn’t known for its progressiveness. But protesters Saturday said that image is changing as more activists call the city home.

Grace Erickson a BYU student and a member of the Latter-day Saint faith attended Saturday’s protest. She said she has hope the community will become more inclusive so its young people will “actually understand the world that they’re going to be living in rather than this bubble that Provo kind of has. …

“I think it just represents that Provo is ready for a change” Erickson said. “At the BYU campus it can feel so polarizing being a liberal or being a Democrat. I feel like for a lot of BYU students who are liberal we’re wanting BYU to change we’re wanting BYU to become more inclusive because right now they’re really not.”

(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) People march through downtown Provo protesting after the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade on Saturday June 25 2022.

Erickson is studying public health at BYU and she said prohibiting abortion is “directly a public health crisis.”

“If we actually looked at what the problem is and confronted those problems first — got universal health care got child care got resources for families and got contraception for families — then we could solve this problem” Erickson said “rather than just saying ‘Let’s get rid of abortion.’”

One of the speakers at Saturday’s protest 19-year-old Chloe Sokol told the crowd about having an abortion earlier this month. It was “just crazy” she said that she she had more rights just two weeks ago than she does now.

“I found out that I was pregnant in the middle of May” Sokol said. “It was a shock to me considering that not only was I on birth control but we were also taking precautions. … When I told someone that I wasn’t feeling well they suggested that I should take a test — and thank God that they did. Who knows how long I would have gone without realizing that I was pregnant and by the time I might have realized it my right to terminate that pregnancy would have been gone.”

Through the emotional process Sokol said she never doubted her decision to have an abortion — and that no one could tell her otherwise. She said she also had lots of support through the procedure including her boyfriend the nursing staff and her “extremely pro-life mother.”

“She told me no one gets to make this choice but you” Sokol said. “She even knew the importance of making my own decision especially with something as personal as that.”

(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) People march through downtown Provo protesting after the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade on Saturday June 25 2022.

Sokol said that her experience was “overwhelmingly positive” and felt the stigma surrounding abortion makes it seem more traumatic than it is — when abortion really is she said a medical procedure.

“The thing is whether I was scared or not the thing that I had — I had the choice. I had the option to have my abortion and that is extremely important” Sokol said. “It was necessary for my future my career and my mental and physical health. I’m glad I had the opportunity to choose but now that has been taken from us. And we have to stand up and fight back — not just for the women now but for the women of the future.”

Para ser exactos el medio local Famitsu reveló que la semana pasada se vendieron 6.695 consolas Xbox Series X|S números que se dividen en 3.272 consolas Xbox Series X vendidas frente a las 3.432 unidades vendidas del modelo de menor potencia la Xbox Series S.

Al lado contrario tenemos a la PlayStation 5 que sumando las ventas de ambos modelos (con/sin unidad óptica) consiguieron vender 3.035 unidades durante dicha semana es decir menos de la mitad de lo que ha conseguido vender Microsoft en el país.

Si hablamos de consolas portátiles Nintendo sigue a otro nivel habiendo conseguido vender durante esa semana 50.405 unidades. Estas ventas se dividen en 22.860 unidades para el modelo OLED 19.907 unidades para el modelo original y 7.638 unidades para la Switch Lite. Esto básicamente se debe a una combinación de ofrecer una mayor disponibilidad y un precio más asequible.

Mencionamos disponibilidad ya que las ventas de PlayStation 5 se han reducido en Japón debido a que Sony está teniendo problemas para suministrar consolas mientras que parece que en Microsoft ese problema está siendo cosa del pasado. La Xbox Series S siempre ha estado disponible desde su lanzamiento y las ventas de este modelo han sido mejores que las que podría esperar hasta la propia compañía ya que su finalidad era sencilla cubrir un hueco de mercado de un usuario que quería una consola de nueva generación a precio asequible. Si a eso le sumamos una situación donde es complicado comprar una PlayStation 5 o Xbox Series X pues muchos usuarios terminaban adquiriendo dicha consola para evitar las esperas.

Si hablamos de números globales la consola de Sony aún lleva la ventaja pues desde la fecha se han vendido 1.694.003 millones de PlayStation 5 (de ellas sólo 242.208 son en su versión digital) mientras que las Xbox Series X|S acumulan sólo 122.059 unidades (108.983 + 13.076 unidades de forma respectiva) por lo que pese a que en las últimas semanas Microsoft esté superando en ventas a su rival no parece que a largo plazo sea un problema.

La escasez también se traslada a otros productos los mandos

Al menos en el caso de la Xbox Series X los problemas de escasez son cada vez menores pero hace poco Microsoft anunció un nuevo problema y era la escasez de sus propios controladores Xbox. De esta forma la compañía podría haber decidido en reservar todo el stock para su venta conjunta con la consola y evitar romper la cadena de suministro mientras que el mercado de controladores al menos estaría siendo cubierto por sus socios ofreciendo sus propias soluciones bajo su licencia.

En el caso de Sony la historia se repite con su DualSense y es que hay que recordar que se esperaba que la escasez no desapareciera hasta el año 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsYXJpbi5jb20vcnVyYWwvdmVudGFzLW1hcXVpbmFyaWEtYWdyaWNvbGEtbWVqb3ItcmVnaXN0cm8tMTMtYW5vc18wX1pYeXZ5Z0ZrdFYuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsYXJpbi5jb20vcnVyYWwvdmVudGFzLW1hcXVpbmFyaWEtYWdyaWNvbGEtbWVqb3ItcmVnaXN0cm8tMTMtYW5vc18wX1pYeXZ5Z0ZrdFYuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Por qué las ventas de maquinaria agrícola tuvieron su mejor registro en 13 años,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsYXJpbi5jb20vcnVyYWwvdmVudGFzLW1hcXVpbmFyaWEtYWdyaWNvbGEtbWVqb3ItcmVnaXN0cm8tMTMtYW5vc18wX1pYeXZ5Z0ZrdFYuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsYXJpbi5jb20vcnVyYWwvdmVudGFzLW1hcXVpbmFyaWEtYWdyaWNvbGEtbWVqb3ItcmVnaXN0cm8tMTMtYW5vc18wX1pYeXZ5Z0ZrdFYuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000029D4868D090>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsYXJpbi5jb20vcnVyYWwvdmVudGFzLW1hcXVpbmFyaWEtYWdyaWNvbGEtbWVqb3ItcmVnaXN0cm8tMTMtYW5vc18wX1pYeXZ5Z0ZrdFYuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsYXJpbi5jb20vcnVyYWwvdmVudGFzLW1hcXVpbmFyaWEtYWdyaWNvbGEtbWVqb3ItcmVnaXN0cm8tMTMtYW5vc18wX1pYeXZ5Z0ZrdFYuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vaXNyYWVsbm90aWNpYXMuY29tL2FudGlzZW1pdGlzbW8vZ3J1cG9zLWp1ZGlvcy1jb25kZW5hbi1sYS12ZW50YS1kZS10YXphcy1hbnRpc2VtaXRhcy1lbi1wb2xvbmlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grupos judíos condenan la venta de tazas antisemitas en Polonia,"Varios sitios web polacos han recibido duras críticas esta semana por vender tazas que representan una caricatura estereotipada de un hombre judío.

Escrito por el escritor polaco Teodor Jeske-Choiński describe a los judíos como una “tribu parasitaria”.

La portada de la versión moderna publicada por el grupo mediático de extrema derecha Magna Polonia muestra a un judío en diversas formas como comunista reportero y activista LGBTQ insinuando que los judíos están detrás de estos acontecimientos y movimientos.

Anna Tatar de la Asociación antirracista Nunca Más condenó la venta diciendo que reeditar un texto histórico palabra por palabra sin comentarios no hace más que promover su mensaje.

“Esto es simplemente una publicación antisemita” dijo.

Raheli Baratz-Rix jefe del Departamento de Lucha contra el Antisemitismo y Mejora de la Resistencia de la Organización Sionista Mundial dijo que el libro y los productos promueven el antisemitismo.

Son “una reminiscencia de tiempos oscuros y difíciles” dijo refiriéndose al Holocausto. “Desgraciadamente hasta ahora no hemos visto una posición decisiva de las autoridades en Polonia y esta forma de hacer la vista gorda es difícil de digerir”."

Defending Stanley Cup Champion Tampa Bay Lightning aim to even the series on home ice against the Colorado Avalanche

E60 – Unrivaled: Red Wings vs. Avalanche premieres Sunday at 1 p.m. ET on ESPN

Game 6 of the 2022 Stanley Cup Final continues Sunday June 26 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC ESPN+ and the ESPN App as the Tampa Bay Lightning kept their bid for a three-peat alive after defeating the Colorado Avalanche in a closely contested Game 5 at Ball Arena on Friday night.

Ondrej Palat showed up big once again when his team needed him most scoring his third go-ahead game-winning goal of this postseason – all in the last seven minutes of the third period – to help the Lightning force Game 6. Andrei Vasilevskiy contributed with a 35-save performance while Corey Perry added two assists. The Lightning became just the second team in NHL history to win at least four consecutive games while facing elimination all by a one-goal margin.

With the Avalanche still leading the series 3-2 the Stanley Cup Final shifts back to Tampa’s AMALIE Arena with the hosts hoping to force the second Stanley Cup Final Game 7 in the last four years.

Seven LBUSD seniors completed a comprehensive three-year mentoring program and one Long Beach City College student finished a two-year program.

“We are so pleased to honor our graduates” exclaimed CAMEO Chair Debby Mather. “Over the past few years we’ve seen our students’ confidence grow and they have impressed us with their strength and resilience in this challenging time.

“The mentoring and enrichment program helps our students prepare for and thrive in college” Mather added. “We are excited to announce that all of the graduates (Brenda Alcantara Anahi Bedoy Isabel Tejeda Logan Pope Wendy Alcala Leila Lee Janai McNeil and Amya Hart) will be going on to college this year.”

The program is designed to guide underserved Long Beach high school and community college students through a one-on-one mentoring to help them identify and fulfill their college and career goals. In addition to mentoring the students attended monthly enrichment workshops and cultural activities.

“Participating in the events internship and mentoring has helped our students blossom into strong young adults who show great promise for their futures” said Mentoring Chair Margaret Warren. “We are so excited to celebrate their amazing accomplishments.”

Students also completed a paid summer internship in partnership with Pacific Gateway and received funds to buy books and academic materials.

Each graduate received a computer and academic scholarship funds. This year each student received the $1000 Continuing Education Scholarship and a $2000 Special Scholarship.

Additional scholarships were awarded to Wendy Alacala Isabel Tejeda Brenda Alcantara Logan Pope and Anahi Bedoy. Three former CAMEO students spoke at the luncheon about what it meant to be in the program: Alvin Avina Nohelia Gavarrete and Sara Manangon gave inspiring talks.

Children’s Benefit League Installation

Old Ranch Country Club was the beautiful setting for the June 1 Children’s Benefit League installation meeting where 2022 donations were distributed to the representatives of various charities.

For many years the Children’s Benefit League has supported five children’s clinics: The Children’s Clinic Children’s Dental Health Clinic The Guidance Center The John Tracy Center and Ability First.

An early social time was scheduled so that the group was able to catch up with each other.

Members appreciated the chance to chat with the representatives of the clinics to see how they are faring as they were restricted from visiting during much of the coronavirus pandemic.

It is hoped that visits will be back on track next year as the members and staff of the clinics enjoy these important visits which increase the scope of understanding the clinics provide to the underserved in the community. Members were pleased with the amount raised and looked forward to another successful year.

At another Children’s Benefit League event new members hosted a Cinco de Mayo Long Beach Harbor Cruise and lunch at Gladstones. It was a glorious Long Beach day with sunshine and gentle breezes that sped 30 ladies around the harbor and back to Gladstones for a bountiful buffet lunch. Cherie de Gomez and Donna Luciene chaired the event. Money was raised for the five clinics the league serves.

Last week Spotify launched a new pop culture show Breaking Bread on Spotify Live. Breaking Bread’s recordings now rank at number 11 on Spotify’s top podcast chart after holding the number two spot for most of the week putting it just behind Joe Rogan. The show’s popularity — and the reason the company might be staying quiet about its new hit — is due to its two hosts: Jackie Oshry Weinreb and Claudia Oshry (aka Instagram’s girlwithnojob) who come with a huge built-in audience. While the sisters have delivered their massive fanbase to the app they have a controversial history that could be problematic for Spotify at a time when the company is being extra cautious.

The sisters had a short-lived show in 2018 on Oath Verizon’s now-defunct media brand that was canceled after The Daily Beast reported that their mom is notorious conspiracy theorist and anti-Muslim activist Pamela Geller and that the sisters had both previously posted racist and anti-Muslim statements on social media. The sisters apologized deleted their Twitter accounts and relaunched with The Morning Toast as an independent podcast. Some fans have been uncomfortable with their unwillingness to disavow their mother’s activities but their audience is undeniable. The Oshry sisters have more than 3.5 million Instagram followers between them their flagship podcast currently ranks in the top 100 on Apple Podcasts and Spotify and they maintain what appears to be a robust Patreon base (the stats are now private but as of 2019 they had more than 9000 subscribers). The Oshry sisters did not respond to a request for comment.

But if the Oshry sisters are controversial you wouldn’t know it from their show. The Morning Toast is mostly run-of-the-mill pop culture fare and Breaking Bread is much of the same: Kim Kardashian’s Marilyn Monroe dress Hailey Bieber’s skincare line Britney Spears’ wedding. The Spotify Live platform also allows fans to participate in the show asking for advice on light topics like puppy training and bachelorette woes.

Following the model of other Spotify Live shows like After Hours with Alex Cooper and Dating Harry Jowsey the original show takes place on the Live app and is posted as a podcast on Spotify later. Unlike those shows Breaking Bread received no promotion from Spotify. The company did not issue a press release about the show and did not push it on any of its social channels. The only promotion seems to have come from the Oshrys themselves on their social accounts and podcast.

That may have something to do with the backlash Spotify has received for its nine-figure deal with controversy machine Joe Rogan. Rogan has the undisputed biggest podcast in the world and as Spotify grows its podcasting might the company needs him. But Spotify’s unfailing support for Rogan has caused some reputational if not monetary damage. Spotify declined to comment on why they chose to partner with the Oshry sisters or whether their past has anything to do with the lack of promotion for the show but with the way the company has approached Breaking Bread it seems to be going for the Oshrys’ substantial fanbase without the baggage.

Even if Breaking Bread itself is inoffensive it is debuting at a time when Spotify is being particularly careful. Last week the company announced a Safety Advisory Council to assist in its content moderation policies (a move Geller called “a government sponsored internal coup”) and cut a new deal with Integral Ad Science to firm up its brand safety analytics for advertisers.",,,

VICI,Vici Properties,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzI1L3RoZXNlLTItcmVpdHMtYXJlLWFsbC1pbi1vbi10aGUtYm9vbWVyLXJldGlyZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 2 REITs Are All In On the Boomer Retirement Trend,"VICI and CareTrust will profit as baby boomers retire early.

Millions of baby boomers were faced with a choice when the pandemic began: learn an entirely new way of working (from home) or pull the pin and retire earlier than they may have planned. Just over half of Americans age 55 or older are out of the workforce due to retirement and over the past two years the growth rate of new baby boomer retirees is over three time higher than it was before the pandemic .

It's possible that some of these people will have to go back to work as inflation grows and the stock market downturn takes a bite out of their retirement savings but many of them will stay retired. The two REITs (real estate investment trusts) we're going to talk about today VICI Properties (VICI -0.98%) and CareTrust REIT (CTRE -0.24%) are capitalizing on the boomer retirement boom. Let's discuss how.

VICI

VICI owns and leases entertainment and casino properties. It owns 43 casino properties including 13 in Las Vegas and has properties in 14 other states. Las Vegas properties make up 45% of its rent roll. It owns 39700 hotel rooms and 5.9 million square feet of space on the Las Vegas Strip alone.

VICI's bet is that as baby boomers retire they will start spending more and more time at casinos. Since it was formed as the result of a spinoff in 2017 VICI has done $29 billion of deals and issued $17 billion of equity.

The REIT has a 100% occupancy rate and collected 100% of rent owed through the pandemic. The high barriers to entry in the casino world make it unlikely that it will ever endure prolonged vacancies. It's also focusing on combating inflation. Forty-seven percent of leases have escalators based on the consumer price index (CPI) in 2022 and 96% will have the escalators in 2023.

It is still a relatively young company and revenue is growing quickly rising 25% in 2021 . Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) is up from $690 million in 2017 to $2.6 billion in the four quarters ended March 31.

Usually companies growing as fast as VICI do by forsaking a dividend and reinvesting all net income back into the business. As a REIT VICI isn't allowed to do that. Its profitable lease income is paid out to shareholders. Right now the dividend is just under 5%. VICI could represent both growth and income in your portfolio.

CareTrust

CareTrust is a healthcare REIT that specializes in senior housing skilled nursing and related properties. Like VICI it was spun off relatively recently in 2014. It owns 228 properties in 29 states with almost 24000 beds .

When you see senior housing you may be quick to assume the REIT majors in assisted-living facilities which are often utilized by those aged 75 or older and don't really fit into our thesis for this article. But CareTrust's focus is on skilled nursing facilities.

Skilled nursing facilities are where patients can stay when they need around-the-clock care after some sort of medical procedure. The facilities are typically staffed by healthcare providers and physical and occupational therapists. Stays in a skilled nursing facility are typically longer than hospital stays but are still short term as the patients use the stay to work toward being able to return home.

Baby boomers who undergo intensive surgery to replace both knees or a hip may choose to stay in a skilled nursing facility while rehabbing form the surgery (and before making a couple of trips to casinos). Like VICI CareTust has been growing quickly. It owned 94 facilities when it was spun off in 2014 and has purchased 165 since then an average of 20 per year . Also like VICI it has a healthy dividend yield of 6.3 %.

Macro trends

In times of economic uncertainty it makes sense to find investment options that are driven by strong long-term macro trends. No matter what happens to the stock market over the next year or two there will be plenty of baby boomers going to casinos and needing skilled nursing care over the next 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Netherland-based payments provider Adyen (ADYE.Y -0.38%) was a relatively unknown player until it got on some investors' radar after replacing PayPal (PYPL -3.20%) on eBay (EBAY -0.76%) in 2018. But compared to PayPal Adyen still fails to get name recognition from investors. However that might soon be changing.

Here are two reasons Adyen is on the way to the top of the payments industry.

1. Adyen has a data advantage over competitors

Adyen started in 2006 with the idea of developing a modern payments platform. However Adyen management realized early on that payments processing was already becoming commoditized. And to survive the company needed to differentiate itself.

Management eventually decided to squeeze more value from the avalanche of transactional data that the company was collecting -- especially after gaining large customers like Uber (UBER -5.72%) Spotify (SPOT 0.20%) Meta Platforms (META 0.93%) and Netflix (NFLX 0.57%). Soon after that decision it began using insights from the analysis of its data stockpile to build new features and products that became extremely popular with merchants.

For example among the first products to come out of Adyen's data-driven approach was RevenueAccelerate in 2016 which helped increase the payments approval rate for merchants on Adyen's platform. When Adyen introduced the product few payments companies stressed increasing approval rates to boost merchant revenue. Instead other payments companies tried to win over merchants by offering lower prices. Consequently Adyen gained traction as merchants with a large volume of transactions could gain much more revenue by raising approval rates than the merchants could save through lower costs from competitors.

Adyen continues to innovate beyond RevenueAccelerate. Last year the company introduced a product called Score that uses artificial intelligence to identify malicious activity on a merchant's platform. The global online fundraising platform GoFundMe became one of the first users of Score.

2. Adyen disrupts the old value chain in the payments process

Historically credit and debit card payments flow through a patchwork of many intermediaries increasing the complexity and cost of money traveling across the payment network from shopper to merchant. However today that old value chain is being threatened by Adyen.

Adyen might have started as a payments gateway and processor but today it is much more. Adyen has put together the building blocks to become an end-to-end payments platform by replacing the functions of all intermediaries between the customer and the merchant except for card networks like Visa (V 0.26%) and Mastercard (MA 0.38%).

What is the benefit of using Adyen over the legacy system of multiple intermediaries?

First merchants benefit from Adyen's integrated platform which is much more efficient and less costly than the solutions offered by traditional payments providers which often use complex inefficient technology.

Second it is very challenging for merchants to integrate the international operations of different intermediaries. Adyen is possibly the only company that can offer a globally integrated payments infrastructure platform to merchants -- which becomes even more important as retailers seek more global sales.

Most of Adyen's competitors are ill-equipped to serve the needs of merchants in a global marketplace -- a possible reason Adyen is outperforming its peers.

Potential slowdown scenarios

While Adyen's second-half 2021 net revenue growth of 47% year over year with an earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 64% sounds fantastic in this challenging market investors worry about merchant sales growth slowing in 2022 due to the halt of stimulus checks in the U.S. the Russian-Ukrainian war and a possible recession.

After investors saw that April's Mastercard SpendingPulse report confirmed fears of slowing e-commerce growth many e-commerce and payment stocks dropped. And Adyen was not immune to those concerns with its stock slumping 40% year to date. Additionally even with the drop Adyen still sells at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.73. PEG ratios over 1.0 are considered a high valuation especially in a bear market. Should a recession occur and merchants' sales growth shrink Adyen's stock price could fall further.

However in Adyen's last earnings report at the end of 2021 management said it has yet to see a sales slowdown on its platform. So while it is risky in the short term to invest in a high-growth company like Adyen before a potential worldwide recession long-term investors should consider squirreling away a few shares of this dominant payments company especially if shares fall further.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9sZWdhbC9pbW1pZ3JhdGlvbi91YWUtdmlzYS1jYW4taS1yZW5ldy1yZXNpZGVuY3ktaWYtbXktcGFzc3BvcnQtZXhwaXJlcy1pbi02LW1vbnRocy1sdng1cnp5ddIBe2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9sZWdhbC9pbW1pZ3JhdGlvbi91YWUtdmlzYS1jYW4taS1yZW5ldy1yZXNpZGVuY3ktaWYtbXktcGFzc3BvcnQtZXhwaXJlcy1pbi02LW1vbnRocy1sdng1cnp5dT9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UAE visa: Can I renew residency if my passport expires in 6 months?,"Question: My UAE residency is up for renewal in a month. And my passport expires in less than six months. Do I need to renew my passport first to get my UAE residency? Is there a minimum passport validity requirement to renew residency?

Response: Pursuant to your queries in the UAE a resident’s visa may be renewed only if his or her passport is valid for at least six months. Therefore as the validity of your passport is less than six months and your UAE residency visa is up for renewal within a month it is recommended to renew your passport at the earliest and thereafter you may renew your UAE residence visa.

For further clarifications you may contact the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (the ‘GDRFA’) – Dubai if you are a resident of Dubai or the GDRFA – Ras Al Khaimah if you are resident of Ras Al Khaimah or Federal Authority for Identity Citizenship Customs & Port Security if you are resident of any one of the emirates among Abu Dhabi Sharjah Umm Al Quwain Ajman and Fujairah.

Let the family know you are thinking of them

Thomas Waddell Bailey Jr loving husband father and grandfather passed away peacefully on Thursday June 23 2022. Funeral services will be held Sunday June 26 2022 at 3:00 P.M. from Calvary Baptist Church – 1121 Paul W. Bryant Dr. Tuscaloosa AL 35401 with burial to follow in Evergreen City Cemetery. Tony Smithson of Calvary Baptist Church will be officiating. A visitation will be held one hour prior to the services.

He was preceded in death by his mother Bessie Bailey Fowler; father Thomas Waddell Bailey Sr.; son-in-law Stephen B. Baker; numerous loving aunts uncles and cousins.

Tom is survived by his wife Robin Lee Bailey Tuscaloosa AL; daughters Cindy Bailey Baker Orange Beach AL Catherine Bailey Newell (Chris) Saraland AL and Tracey Bailey Key (Jason) Winfield AL; son Thomas Waddell Bailey III Saraland AL; stepdaughters Joy Underwood Sprink (John) Cary NC Jill Underwood Clark (David) Birmingham AL and Janet Underwood Anderson (Brian) Birmingham AL; stepson Eric Roy Underwood (Cindy) Birmingham AL; sister Mary Anne Bailey Rogers Richmond VA; grandchildren Mason VanSword (Lizzie) Birmingham AL Alex Newell (Caitlin) Mobile AL Evan Underwood (Caroline) Augusta GA Cayla Underwood Hildreth (Matthew) Savannah GA Michael Clark Birmingham AL Sam Key Tuscaloosa AL Parker Newell Atlanta GA Margaret Anne Clark Birmingham AL Johnny Sprink Raleigh NC Emma Newell Saraland AL Harrison Clark Birmingham AL Bailey Key Harris (Brennan) Winfield AL Justin Sprink Cary NC Courtney Clark Birmingham AL Campbell Anderson Birmingham AL Hunter Anderson Birmingham AL and Jackson Sprink Cary NC; great grandchildren Grady Newell Grey VanSword and Sawyer Harris.

Tom was born on September 7 1938 in Tuscaloosa AL. His love of the city of Tuscaloosa as well as The University of Alabama ran long and deep.

Tom and his wife Robin loved making memories together at their lake home (referred to as “Camp Bailey”) in Northport AL where friends and family were always welcome. They tried to attend all activities of their 8 children 17 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren as well as attend any Alabama or SEC sporting event (many times combining all of the above).

Tom retired from two companies Vulcan Materials after 24 years with assignments in Birmingham Wichita Kansas Atlanta Georgia Chicago Illinois and Sandusky Ohio and also from Morrow Realty Company where he was Vice President and CFO. Before retirement and throughout Tom enjoyed the challenge of first one marathon (Marine Corp Marathon to raise money for the Leukemia Society) and continued to conquer the goal of completing a marathon in each of the 50 states as well as provinces of Canada.

Tom never met a stranger and wouldn’t hesitate to ask you about your life and where you were from and discover your common connections. His collection of friends began in elementary school and continued throughout his life that included his softball friends marathon training friends church families work friends and neighbors.

Tom didn’t believe in just being a member of an organization but he believed in fully participating in and usually serving in leadership of these organizations. For example he is a Past President of a local chapter as well as on the council for the National Association of Accountants.

One of Tom’s greatest attributes was his commitment to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Although we will all miss him we find comfort in knowing he is meeting his father and also reunited with his mother in heaven.

Stellantis made a €50 million (about $52 million) equity investment in Vulcan recently to increase lithium production for EV manufacturing.

Vulcan plans to use the investment for expansion drilling in its Upper Rhine Valley Brine Field (URVBF) where it aims to produce lithium hydroxide. Vulcan’s URVBF already produces geothermal energy. It plans to expand to lithium hydroxide using zero fossil fuels through the Zero Carbon Lithium Project.

Vulcan’s lithium project is located in Upper Rhine Valley Germany. According to the company the Zero Carbon Lithium Project does not require large open pits for hard-rock mining. It won’t require large quantities of water either. Vulcan estimates it could produce one tonne of lithium hydroxide using very little water and occupying a relatively smaller amount of land compared to other processes.

Stellantis Volkswagen and Tesla’s long-time battery supplier LG Energy Solution have already signed contracts to receive Vulcan’s first battery-quality lithium hydroxide products for EVs. In addition to its recent investment Stellantis extended its initial binding offtake agreement with Vulcan to 10 years.

“Making this highly strategic investment in a leading lithium company will help us create a resilient and sustainable value chain for our European electric vehicle battery production” said Carlos Tavares Stellantis CEO. “We continue our quest of forming strong relationships with partners who share our values as we collectively fight against global warming and provide clean safe and affordable mobility to our customers.”

Top EV manufacturer Tesla has identified lithium as a potential limiting factor to future EV production and the company’s personal goal. Tesla has signed supply deal agreements with a few companies including Core Lithium and Lionwtown Resources in Australia to secure Li supplies.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk encouraged young entrepreneurs to invest in the lithium industry during the last earnings call.

“So we think we’re going to need to help the industry on this front but I mean the industry is very fast. And I certainly encourage entrepreneurs out there who are looking for opportunities to get into the lithium business. The lithium margins right now are practically software margins” he said.

Top stories this past week included:

A look at a regional problem that is affecting bodies of water around Greater Taunton: invasive weeds. And it's not just Lake Sabbatia. Representatives from the state Department of Conservation and Recreation spoke at the June 13 Conservation Commission meeting about aquatic management needed for Massasoit State Park. Big Bearhole Pond Middle Pond and Lake Rico are all dealing with invasive weeds according to Kara Sliwoski from DCR’s Lakes and Ponds Program. Here's how DCR plans to get rid of them.

The real estate market has seen a lot of changes throughout the pandemic from prices skyrocketing to bidding wars. Another major change as with so many other aspects of life during COVID has been a huge pivot to remote homebuying. Remote home purchases aren't new exactly — people buying from across the country for example have long used this option. However remote homebuying has become much more local throughout the pandemic and the practice could be here to stay.

These were the Top 5 stories of the past week according to Gazette readers:

The actor and entrepreneur is launching product in the U.K. in an exclusive partnership with Boots starting on Wednesday. For Ross the move was a natural extension of her accessible vision for textured hair care.

“The original dream for the brand was to be a global brand because I believe that the curly and textured community is one that spans across the globe” she told WWD. “I wanted to expand that mission so that everybody has access to their most beautiful and healthy hair.”

Boots made an ideal partner for the brand given its broad footprint. “85 percent of the U.K. population is within 10 minutes of a Boots store” she added.

Although parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance is considering selling Boots as it refocuses its health care business in the U.S. WWD reported that sales in Boots grew double-digits due to increased foot traffic earlier this year.

For the Pattern’s future Ross hasn’t ruled out any other geographies especially given the brand’s success at Ulta Beauty and Sephora she noted. “Africa is a place I’d like to expand to. I would like Pattern to be everywhere because I believe that we are everywhere” Ross said. “We will keep going from there.”

It all ladders up to Ross’ goal to bring innovation and information to Pattern’s consumers. “The brand was born out of my own personal hair care journey and my experiences brought me into a community of people that were like me becoming their own best experts” she said.

“Part of why I’m proud of how well Pattern is doing is that we’re going across the pond to bring that knowledge and information” she continued.

Ross referenced a recent McKinsey & Co. survey she partnered with the firm on called “Black representation in the beauty industry” which quantifies those disparities. Black-owned brands are only 2.5 percent of total beauty revenue per the survey despite Black consumers accounting for 11.1 percent of beauty spending. Black consumers are also three times more likely to not find adequate skin care hair care or makeup options.

That vision hasn’t come without its learnings though. “I’m the CEO and founder and I’m majority owner of the company with full creative control. My hands are on everything” she said. “One thing I didn’t know before was how much goes into product: the marketing the language on the packaging sustainability all of the regulations shifting.”

On the product side Ross has been busy. “I’m in product mode” she said. “We do our [product] drops in a very staggered way. They’re happening on a regular basis and so there are a few very big launches that are going to happen.”

Police say the men pretend to be regular customers checking out but when the cash drawer opens they strike claiming to be armed.

Two men robbed cashiers at a Bensalem Walmart just off of Lincoln Highway Wednesday evening. Police said the same store was also targeted in Mid-may.

The robbers have also hit Walmarts in Oxford Pennsylvania; Deptford and Burlington New Jersey; New Castle Delaware; and Aberdeen Maryland police say.

""No retailer is immune to the challenge of crime and we recognize its impact at the highest levels of our company"" Walmart said in a statement to NBC10.

One example of a customer doing just that recently went viral on TikTok. In a video that now has over 3.3 million views user Michelle (@bekindre_wine) documents her mom cutting her own fabric at Walmart a job that’s supposed to be done by an employee.

“My mom will not let a little staff shortage keep her from getting fabric at Walmart” she writes in the caption.

In the video one can hear Michelle’s mom complain about the lack of staffing.

“I’m not waiting for…somebody to come here” she says as she unrolls a bundle of fabric and begins to cut.

In the text overlaying the video Michelle adds “No employees? No problem…I’ll do it my damn self!”

In comments users seconded the idea that Michelle’s mother was not being helped due to staffing issues.

According to viewers Walmart employees are frequently required to cover several sections which in turn leaves many areas unattended for long periods of time. In spite of this Walmart insists that the company has an overstaffing issue per Marketplace.

“Not [our] fault when management keeps telling us we are over staffed and we have one associate to work an entire department” one user wrote.

“Please be patient with the staff” another added. “In my store there is usually one person for that whole side of the store and they are covering other areas.”

“People work multiple departments” a third explained. “I guarantee you as well that the employee got stopped multiple times on their way to help too. And we can’t say no.”

“Just letting you all know that they literally make 1 person cover 5 departments by themselves. so it’s not easy being everywhere” a fourth claimed. “Also not everyone has keys. I don’t even work in Hardlines and I have to cover Hardware Sporting goods Fabric Stationary and Celebrations along with my 9 departments in Apparel…so just chill and hold on.”

“Apparently we’re all overstaffed with no staff” they concluded. “it’s getting crazy.”

In comments Michelle clarifies that she did not intend for her video to come off as insulting to the people working at Walmart.

“This was not meant to be disrespectful” she wrote. “I’ve worked in retail for many years. I know the struggle is real.”

We’ve reached out to Michelle via TikTok comment and Walmart via media contact form.

The supply chain crisis has retailers considering the unthinkable: Instead of returning your unwanted items just keep them.

The supply chain crisis has retailers considering the unthinkable: Instead of returning your unwanted items just keep them.

The chaotic mix of record fuel prices and an unending supply chain crisis have retailers considering the unthinkable: Instead of returning your unwanted items just keep them.

In recent weeks some of the biggest store chains including Target Walmart Gap American Eagle Outfitters and others have reported in their latest earnings calls that they have too much inventory of stuff ranging from workout clothes spring-time jackets and hoodies to garden furniture and bulky kids' toys. It's costing them tons of money to store it.

Now add on to that glut another category of product that stores have to deal with: returns.

So instead of piling returned merchandise onto this growing inventory heap stores are considering just handing customers their money back and letting them hang onto the stuff they don't want.

""It would be a smart strategic initiative"" said Burt Flickinger retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. ""Retailers are stuck with excess inventory of unprecedented levels. They can't afford to take back even more of it.""

Returned products are handled in a number of different ways he said. Retailers take back merchandise from the customer evaluate it and if it's in good condition put it back on the shelf at the same or lesser price.

Federal Reserve attacks inflation with its largest rate hike since 1994

The Federal Reserve is attacking inflation with its largest rate hike since 1994.

They can refurbish damaged returns and sell them for less or offload them to liquidators to resell. They also can sell returned products to foreign liquidators for sale in Europe Canada or Mexico.

""Given the situation at the ports and the container shortages sending product overseas isn't really an option"" said Flickinger. Lastly retailers can hire third party firms to handle all aspect of merchandise returns for them.

Each of these options however tack on additional costs for retailers he said.

""For every dollar in sales a retailer's net profit is between a cent to five cents. With returns for every dollar in returned merchandise it costs a retailer between 15 cents to 30 cents to handle it"" said Flickinger.

There is one other option for retailers to address returns while avoiding more product bloat and that's to consider a 'returnless return' said Steve Rop chief operating officer with goTRG a firm that processes over 100 million returned items annually for companies like Wal-Mart Amazon and Lowe's.

Just keep it

Rop said his company's clients are 100% considering offering the ""keep it"" option for returns this year although he wouldn't disclose if any of his customers have implemented the ""Keep it"" returns policy yet.

In some instances when they determine it would be easier some retailers advise customers to just keep or donate their return after issuing a refund. Walmart said it had nothing to share at this time. Lowe's didn't provide a comment for the story.

""They're already discounting in stores to clear out products but when there's heavy discounting buyer's remorse goes up. People are tempted to buy a lot to only return it later"" he said.

Refunding customers while simultaneously letting them keep their returns isn't a new practice said Rop. ""It started with Amazon several years ago"" he said.

The offer makes sense for some types of products -- lower price-tier bulky items like furniture kitchen appliances home decor baby chairs walkers strollers where it's costly for the retailer to cover the shipping cost for the return.

""Other products like kids' toys footwear towels and bedding raise sanitary concerns when it comes to returns. It could also apply to these categories"" he said.

Another concern with cheaper items: Stores typically discount returned products so the amount of money they can make on an inexpensive return is miniscule -- and may not be worth the tradeoff says Keith Daniels partner with Carl Marks Advisors.

Still a ""keep it"" policy has its own disadvantages namely: Companies will need to ensure that they don't become victims of fraud.

""One thing retailers need to track and ensure is that customers that become aware of the (Keep it) policy do not begin to abuse it by seeking free merchandise over a series of orders by getting a refund but getting to keep the merchandise"" said Daniels.

Countless reasons bring people to theme parks. Some of us come for the thrill rides such as roller coasters. Others enjoy the entertainment including live shows and nighttime spectaculars. For some fans it's all about the theme in theme parks - the immersive spaces that recreate famous locations from around the world or the worlds of fantasy and science fiction.

Maybe it's the chance to spend time with a specific entertainment franchise - or collection of franchises - that entices you to visit. Or perhaps you are just a fan of travel and make your way to theme parks from time to time because they have become such popular tourist destinations.

For our Vote of the Week this weekend I would like to hear what kind of fan you most consider yourself to be. Of course many Theme Park Insider readers - including me! - love parks for a wide variety of reasons. I enjoy the thrill rides the dark rides the shows the immersive spaces and more. But for this vote I want to push you to pick the top reason why you come to - or just follow - the parks.

I thought of this vote following the social media dust-up over the latest Big Media article about Disney fans Rolling Stone's How ‘Disney Adults’ Became the Most Hated Group on the Internet. There's much in that piece that set my eyes rolling so I want to move past any discussion about that article itself and instead focus on the question that it has inspired.



Some Disney fans love coasters and vice versa. Photo courtesy Disney

Obviously love of Disney as a brand brings millions of fans to its theme parks every year. So I have included ""Disney fan"" as one of the options in this week's poll. Yet I don't see any other theme park chain cultivating the same sort of brand loyalty - and brand self-identity - that Disney has. I am certain that there are devoted fans of Universal Legoland Six Flags and perhaps ever SeaWorld out there. But none of those fan bases have coalesced and self-realized to the extent that Disney's has.

What might the other options be then? I think that the community of self-identified roller coaster fans might be comparable to the number of Disney fans out there. Otherwise I think that people might first identify simply as theme park fans or even just general travel fans when asked. From my past research asking Theme Park Insider readers those have been the top four categories that compose the theme park fanbase so I will present them as our options today.

Let's see how the numbers work out.

If you would like to share a specific moment or example that most sold you on theme parks please do so in the comments. And as always thank you for reading and being a part of the Theme Park Insider community.

Discovery.

While at the Collision Conference in Toronto Canada POST Wrestling’s own John Pollock caught up with AEW President Tony Khan for an interview.

With the AEW x NJPW Forbidden Door show just days away from when the interview was recorded Khan spoke about collaborating with New Japan Pro-Wrestling booker Gedo to put together the match card. He said they both have great and intelligent people surrounding them.

Well I think we [Khan & Gedo] both have great offices. Gedo has Rocky Romero and a number of very intelligent people that work with him in New Japan Pro-Wrestling. I have a great office and a lot of smart people that work with me but it is primarily myself and Gedo and the two of us have both put forward the top wrestlers from AEW and many top wrestlers from New Japan Pro-Wrestling and they’re gonna come together on Sunday for a great pay-per-view event.

To wrap up the discussion Khan touched on AEW’s U.S. media rights and said he will be leading those conversations when it comes time to negotiate.

Khan added that he’s had great discussions with those at Warner Bros. Discovery and thinks they can continue to expand internationally and venture into streaming and reality TV.

Yeah I will be [leading the talks for AEW’s U.S. Media rights deal] and I have had great conversations with the people at Warner Bros. Discovery about the partnership and I’m very happy with our great partnership and the new management that’s come in from Discovery has great expertise in many areas including streaming which is an area where I believe we can expand our partnership in addition to the great television we put on every week with Wednesday night Dynamite on TBS every week and Friday night Rampage on TNT and we can expand I think internationally together and also as I said there’s opportunities in streaming and also reality TV which is one of the incredible core competencies where Discovery is a worldwide leader. So a lot of great opportunities together for the future hopefully for a really really long time with AEW and Warner Bros. and Discovery.

Following Forbidden Door John Pollock and Wai Ting will be live with their POST-show and in addition to that there is going to be written coverage of the event on the site.

Discovery merger and issues surrounding The Flash the future of the DCU as a whole is a bit uncertain these days. But in addition to Dwayne Johnson's Black Adam optimism is high for DC's 2023 film Blue Beetle starring Cobra Kai's Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes; and now that filming is well underway production just crossed a milestone with Blue Beetle's villain.

Directed by Angel Manuel Soto Blue Beetle is expected to follow the teenage character of Jaime Reyes as he receives powers from a sacred scarab. In addition to Maridueña as Reyes the DC film also stars George Lopez Bruna Marquezine Belissa Escobedo Harvey Guillen and Susan Sarandon.

While much of the film's plot remains under wraps one Blue Beetle star confirmed that filming wrapped for at least one of its integral characters.

Filming Has Wrapped for Blue Beetle's Villain

DC

Actress Susan Sarandon has shared on Instagram that she has finished filming her role as Blue Beetle's mysterious villain Victoria Kord.

The character of Victoria Kord was reportedly created just for DC's Blue Beetle film.

Sarandon's Instagram caption reads as follows:

""And that’s a wrap on Victoria Kord!""

In April Sarandon was confirmed to have joined the project as Blue Beetle's primary antagonist. Before Sarandon Sharon Stone had been in talks for the role.

Who is Blue Beetle's Main Villain?

Even though Sarandon's Victoria Kord isn't from the comics her character shares the same last name as the second Blue Beetle Ted Kord.

Due to this connection and the fact that Jaime Reyes is the third Blue Beetle DC fans have been speculating about the character's potential ties to the character of Ted Kord as well as his potential role or influence.

Fans have also heard that Victoria Kord isn't the only villain Blue Beetle's Jamie Reyes will be dealing with. It's expected that the film will include Carapax the Indestructible Man who also has comic book ties to Ted Kord.

Since Blue Beetle began filming in Atlanta fans have already caught a glimpse of the hero's impressive-looking blue suit. As production marches on more information is sure to be revealed; and perhaps fans will learn a bit more about the film's villainous duo.

Blue Beetle is set to debut in theaters on August 18 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy91cy1jb21wYW5pZXMtY292ZXItYWJvcnRpb24tdHJhdmVsLWNvc3RzL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zYWNyYW1lbnRvL25ld3MvdXMtY29tcGFuaWVzLWNvdmVyLWFib3J0aW9uLXRyYXZlbC1jb3N0cy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These US Companies Will Cover Travel Costs For Employees Who Need An Abortion,"(CNN) -- After the Supreme Court ruled on Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees — and in some cases their dependents — seeking abortions in states that outlaw the procedure.

The court's decision to roll back the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling which protected the federal constitutional right to an abortion is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America leaving abortion policy up to individual states and paving the way for numerous states to pass new abortion restrictions. As of Friday afternoon state officials in at least seven states said that new abortion bans can now be enforced.

Millions of people seeking abortions could soon be forced to travel across state lines to access the procedure adding to the cost of an already often expensive healthcare service. For many employers' benefit packages may be the only way they can afford an abortion.

In response corporations some with headquarters or offices in Republican-controlled states are taking action. Companies such as Citigroup Salesforce and Match Group first promised financial support to employees seeking abortions in affected states after a draft version of the opinion leaked in May. Many more followed suit on Friday. Some including Bumble and Lyft also previously said they would donate to organizations that support women's rights such as Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice.

Corporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent and worry about the impact these states' anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.

Here are some of the prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.

Microsoft

Microsoft extended its financial support for ""critical healthcare"" including abortions and gender-affirming care to include coverage for travel expenses for such services after the draft opinion overturning Roe was first leaked.

Apple

The company's existing benefits package allows employees to travel out of state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state according to an Apple spokesperson.

Meta

The tech giant intends to offer travel expense reimbursement ""to the extent permitted by law"" for employees seeking out-of-state health care and reproductive services according to a spokesperson. ""We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved"" the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

Yelp

Yelp's existing healthcare plan for US employees pays for women family members and partners to travel out of states with strict abortion laws such as Texas and Oklahoma which ban abortions after 6 weeks.

""This ruling puts women's health in jeopardy denies them their human rights and threatens to dismantle the progress we've made toward gender equality in the workplaces since Roe"" Jeremy Stoppelman co-founder of Yelp said in a statement Friday. ""Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.""

Disney

Disney employees who are unable to access medical care in one location will be given affordable coverage to access the same care in another location according to a company spokesperson. The benefit covers family planning and pregnancy-related decisions.

Uber

Uber's US insurance plans already cover reproductive health benefits including abortion and travel expenses to access healthcare. The rideshare company will also reimburse any drivers sued under state law for providing transportation to a clinic through the app according to an Uber spokesperson.

Bumble

Bumble a female-driven dating app said Friday that it will support its employees' ability to access ""the healthcare services they need"" including abortion care. A Bumble spokesperson added that the company will donate to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

""Abortion is healthcare and healthcare is a human right. We are deeply troubled by the Supreme Court decision"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Match Group

Dating app company Match Group in October established a partnership with Planned Parenthood Los Angeles to provide abortion access for its Texas employees and their dependents. The company is currently considering expanding that benefit to all its US staff including remote employees in states with trigger laws that may soon ban abortions according to a Match spokesperson. Match healthcare plans also help to cover travel and lodging costs for employees who need to travel to receive care the spokesperson said.

Box.com

Box.com will cover employee travel and medical expenses incurred by employees while seeking reproductive services.

Levi Strauss

The denim company said through The Levi Strauss Foundation that it is providing grants to the Center for Reproductive Rights Afiya Center and ARC-Southeast which provides direct assistance to women and communities in need of care. The company previously said that under its benefits plan employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren't included in the company's benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement it said.

Comcast-NBC Universal

Comcast has an existing healthcare travel benefit for all employees that covers up to $4000 per trip up to three trips per year with a maximum coverage cap of $10000 per year. The amount paid out depends on the type of health care procedure but abortion care is covered according to the company.

Warner Bros Discovery

Warner Brothers Discovery which owns CNN on Friday expanded healthcare benefits options to include expenses for employees and their covered family members who need to travel to access abortions and other reproductive care according to a company spokesperson.

Condé Nast

The media company said Friday it will reimburse travel and lodging for employees who need abortion infertility or gender-reaffirming services and cannot obtain them locally.

""No matter where our teammates are on their family planning journey — from contraception and abortion coverage to pregnancy and family-building support through fertility surrogacy and adoption benefits — we are here to support their decisions"" the statement reads.

Starbucks

The coffee company is providing employees enrolled in its healthcare plan a medical travel benefit to access an abortion according to a public letter to employees by Sara Kelly Starbucks acting executive vice president of partner resources.

Dick's Sporting Goods

The benefit will be provided to any employee spouse or dependent enrolled in its medical plan along with one support person.

Kroger

Alaska Airlines

PORTSMOUTH Va. — Volunteers in Portsmouth grabbed trash bags and gloves and got to work Saturday morning for a community cleanup.

It’s a joint effort between Stop the Violence 757 and other community partners to bring people together and make the Effingham Street area a little cleaner.

The event was also about reaching out to the community and fighting crime. Organizers also gave out free gun locks to anyone who needed one.

“If you come out and all you see is trash and litter strewn everywhere you’re not going to feel good about your community you’re not going to feel good about yourself” said Freddie Taylor Sr. of Stop The Violence 757.

Taylor also pointed out that it’s not always people in the community who are responsible for the litter.

“By it being a major thoroughfare you have people that’s transient that come through. They’re throwing things out the window” Taylor said.

It’s about taking pride in your neighborhood. Portsmouth's waste management administrator Amos Taylor explained that when a community is clean the people in that community feel better about where they live.

“If everybody works together then we can have areas to look good and have people feel good about where they stay and show people in the community that we care. As well as show others that are coming into the community that we are not going to tolerate it” Taylor said. “And we’re working together to make everything better for everyone.”

Organizers also gave out free meals to those who needed them. They also gave out gun locks in recognition of the rising gun violence across Hampton Roads.

Leaders from Keeping Us Secure and Prosperous (KUSP) and 2 Seconds handed out the gun locks for free.

Jay Boone of KUSP said “We wanted to be boots on the ground and battle the issue with gun violence that we’re seeing.”

Mark Stevens of the 2 Seconds Initiative said something similar.

“It’s not against guns it’s about coming together and figuring out how we as a region can stop the violence"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDQ4OTY5NzIyMDE1MDkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Principal of environmental life cycle assessment for medical waste during COVID-19 outbreak to support sustainable ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722015091 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDQ4OTY5NzIyMDE1MDkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZndlZWsudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tL2xpc3RzL2Jlc3QtZHJpdmFibGUtcGFyLTRzLXBnYS10b3VyLXJpdmllcmEtY291bnRyeS1jbHViLXRwYy1zYXdncmFzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The most entertaining holes in golf: Here are some of the best drivable par 4s on the PGA Tour,"CROMWELL Conn. — When there’s a drivable par 4 on the course it’s going to be one of the most entertaining holes to watch especially if it comes at a critical point in the routing.

This week at the Travelers Championship No. 15 at TPC River Highlands is a par 4 that plays less than 300 yards but trouble awaits in every direction for wayward tee shots. There is water to the left but pros who bail out to the right can easily wind up in bunkers and heavy rough. The green complex is also extremely undulated so any could pro feel a bit uncomfortable.

“Well this one (15) is right up there at the top” Charles Howell III said Thursday when asked about the best drivable par 4s on the PGA Tour.

Climate change is a critical concern for Downsound Entertainment’s Joe Bogdanovich prompting the Reggae Sumfest promoter to declare the annual festival green.

Bogdanovich’s bold move comes after the festival’s face-to-face two-year hiatus and its return to ‘Reggae Sumfest City’ Montego Bay. “We are hosting a green Reggae Sumfest Festival for 2022” the promoter told The Gleaner in May and last week Saturday he commenced the first in a series of activities aimed at achieving the goal.

Some 150 volunteers turned out at the Catherine Hall beach home to the Reggae Sumfest venue for a clean-up exercise that saw Recycling Partners of Jamaica (RPJ) loading up more than 2000 pounds of plastic found on the beach onto their trucks. “We realise there is a global climate crisis and we all need to play our part. We can control the things that are in our space instead of just dumping out the bottles make a conscious decision to use single-use plastic” said Bogdanovich who is anxious to contribute to the reduction of carbon footprints.

A big supporter of the green initiative for a number of years Bogdanovich said what the world was doing to the environment was more than Putin has done in Russia and Ukraine. “It is just overwhelmingly powerful and if we don’t deal with climate change now. We are done.”

Concerned about the future the festival promoter and well-established businessman said in 2020 during the virtual event he would make sure to have ‘Black Lives Matter’ signs and posters throughout the area so the artistes would not miss them before going on stage. So that they would be sensitised before their performances he added. Bogdanovich said the idea was to get this message as part of their subconscious.

In 2022 it’s all about climate change “And we are going to put signs backstage to sensitise the artistes; it’s that important. We have to educate them as well” he explained describing them as good promoters. The initiative he said although it attracts extra expenses was extremely necessary because this needed a different kind of thinking; the message can’t be dull; it must be cool and attractive.

In addition there will be a reduction of plastic at the festival by encouraging patrons to utilise single-use plastic. “The partnership we have with RPJ will see all bars separating the bottles from regular trash. “Once they pour a drink once that bottle is emptied it is not thrown in the same trash as others.” RPJ will dispose of the plastic break them down and ship them out of the country.

Last Saturday the amount of plastic collected during the clean-up was frightening.

RPJ’s supervisor Sophia Kerr who supervises both the Bogue and Greenwood plants says it’s great the team was able to remove the large amount of bottles found on Catherine Hall Beach threatening the aquatic ecosystem. “When our fish eat the bottles we fish eaters end up eating the plastic as well” she cautioned.

Supporters of the initiative included Margaritaville Caribbean Iberostar Pepsi Hardware & Lumber Montego Bay Chamber of Commerce and Industry Island Strains VIP Attractions and St James Municipal Councillor Dwight Crawford.

Reggae Sumfest over seven days in 2019 brought in US$10 million into the Montego Bay economy and all indications show that the festival looks ready to have a repeat.

As the waters started receding following Sylhet division's worst flood in living memory the disastrous damage it inflicted also became evident along with the challenge any recovery effort will face in the days ahead.

The death toll from the third flash flood of the year in Sylhet reached 52 till Sunday morning (from May 17) according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) but this is almost certainly an underestimate with local sources claiming the toll to be much higher. Many areas haven't even been accessed where the authorities have no idea of casualties.

According to Sylhet District administration around 22 lakh people from four lakh families are bearing the brunt of this terrible disaster while 80 per cent of the area still remains under water as of Sunday.

“Part of Sylhet City Corporation all the 13 upazilas and five municipalities and 94 unions were affected in the district. The exact number of people facing the damages will be 2187232 (21 lakh 87 thousand 232) of 416819 families (4 lakh 16 thousand 819)” said Ahsanul Alam Assistant Commissioner of District Administration.

He said 22450 houses and 28945 hectares of cropland have been damaged according to official estimation so far.

However locals are claiming the damage is vaster and the recovery will be long.

Bearing the brunt

Tara Mia 70 from Janigaon village has not seen such a terrible flood in his entire life. “On June 16 when all of a sudden water started entering my house I took shelter near a high area beside Sylhet-Sunamganj highway and remained there since. None cares about us though people come and speed away with their vehicles as we sit helplessly beside the road” he said.

Khushbu Begum 60 from the same village said “Don’t know how we will get back to our homes after flood water lowers as it is filled with soil now.”

Husnahar Banu 35 who took shelter in a ramshackle cottage beside the highway with her six children said”We took refuge here 14 days ago and are not sure how many days we will need to spend on the roads. There is still water inside the home that we left.”

Fifty-five-year-old Kahar Mia was more worried about his cattle as some of them had already washed away. “We can survive by eating flattened or parched rice but the helpless animals might die without their food” he said.

Akkas Ali from Jaikar Kandi village in Kandigaon union returned home from the shelter center on Saturday evening and broke down in tears as nothing but the foundation remained.

“The floodwater took away everything but the clothes on our bodies. We are eating the relief provided by people. How will we build everything back now?” he wondered aloud as he was unsure how to bring back his family from the shelter as there is no home.

Tahera Begum from Moiar Char village said”For five days I took shelter in Badaghat High School and as I returned home found the toilet was broken and everything in the house was damaged. Repairing everything is the biggest challenge for everyone as the flood has snatched our income sources too.""

Broken communication health sectors

The consequence of the flood in Sylhet became graver as the road communications completely broke down and many hospitals were submerged.

A total of 125 Km roads were flooded in Sylhet this time according to the Road Transport and Highways Division and Local Government Engineering Department.

As the water level started reducing the damage to the roads built by the Road Transport division became evident. The water pressure was so heavy that most of the roads were distorted like a cyclone distorts houses.

The major hospitals of Sylhet like Shahid Shamsuddin Ahmed District Hospital MAG Osmani Medical College and Hospital were submerged during the flood and remained completely or partially out of service.

According to the Department of Health 24 out of 40 health complexes in Sylhet division have been affected by the floods. Of the 65 union sub-centers 31 have been flooded. Water entered two 20-bed hospitals in Sunamganj. In addition 414 out of 926 community clinics were submerged in water.

With the exception of 3 upazilas of Sylhet district (Jaintapur Beanibazar Golapganj) all the health facilities of the remaining 10 upazilas were completely submerged. Companiganj and Gowainghat Upazila Health Complexes were under 10 feet of water.

According to a report of the Sylhet Health Department all the affected health facilities have suffered extensive infrastructure damage. Electrical equipment EPI ILR refrigerators pathological examination equipment X-ray machines MSR equipment have been damaged in many health complexes. The extent to which these submerged devices are damaged could not be examined until the water receded.

Current situation

Eighty per cent area of four districts of the division still remains submerged as water started receding from Surma river area but the water level was still concerningly high near Kushiara river areas.

According to the Sylhet Water Development Board (WDB) at 9 am on Sunday the water level of Surma River at Kanaighat Point dropped to 13.57 cm while the water level at Sylhet point of the river decreased to 10.72 cm but all this is still above danger level. Meanwhile the water level of Kushiara River at Sheola Point Sherpur Point and Fenchuganj Point remained unchanged.

Asif Ahmed Executive Engineer of Sylhet WDB said that the water level in Sylhet has started decreasing due to lack of rain in the last 5 days.

“The water level is coming down slowly and if it doesn't rain water will recede in the next couple of days. However there is a possibility of rain again at the end of next month” he said.

After effects & challenges

As of Sunday when many people started returning to their homes from shelter centers another sort of challenge appeared as clogged wastes with water polluted the air in Sylhet city and its suburbs with unbearable stench.

The logged water at Jatarpur Mirabazar Shahjalal upazila Sobhanighat Mirzajangal Taltala Jamtala Sheikhghat Ghasitula Kuarpar and Laladighi areas of the city turned dirty and black. The stench is spreading from the frozen water in these places.

Shahnewaz Hossain a resident of Jatarpur area said the suffering is not ending even though the water receded.

“Earlier the water was a bit cloudy but not dirty. But with time the clogged water has turned black and stinky. As we are walking through dirty water all the time our feet are itching constantly” he said.

Rubel Ahmed Kuasha a local playwright working as a volunteer to help the flood victims said ""For now we need to set up a fund for the rehabilitation of flood victims rather than distributing dry food

“People will be able to overcome crises during floods with their emergency savings and relief. But the main danger will come soon after the water recedes. Because the tin roof and fence of the house are submerged furniture in the house has been damaged and the poultry has been washed away. They will need to repair these after the water recedes” he said

He feared these people may take loans from moneylenders or private companies to repair houses and furniture which will push them toward huge debts.

The Ministry of Disaster and Relief has so far allocated 1412 metric tonnes of rice 13218 packets of dry food and Tk 1.42 crore in cash for the flood-hit areas according to the district administrat",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvdGhlLWJ1eWVycy1iZWhpbmQtZ29sZC1jb2FzdHMtYmlnZ2VzdC1zYWxlcy1vZi10aGUteWVhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The buyers behind Gold Coast's biggest sales of the year - realestate.com.au,"Mining magnates media personalities beer brewers and bookmakers were among a colourful cast of buyers behind the Gold Coast’s biggest residential sales of the financial year.

Together they splashed a total of more than $400m on the 27 most expensive homes that changed hands in the past 12 months.

Glitzy oceanfront mansions canal trophy homes and luxury beachside penthouses caught the eye of these cashed-up buyers during one of the most extraordinary years in property history.

Every sale that made the list was priced at $10m or more as the appetite for lifestyle destinations along the southeast coastline pushed home values to dizzying new highs.

The Coast’s biggest sale of the 2021/22 year was a glamorous three-level riverfront home on the Isle of Capri Surfers Paradise.

The $26.88m sale went under contract in October 2021 although the off-market deal was negotiated a year earlier.

It was sold by Kool Kids early learning centre founder Bruce Coulson and his wife Carolyne to Sydney-based buyer Yao Zhang.

Big-name buyers of other big-ticket sales included businessman Clive Palmer who dropped $20m on a Sovereign Islands mansion owned by German superyacht-builder Klaus Lilischkie.

And former radio host Alan Jones snapped up a $12.25m Southport estate from Brett and Rebecca Frizelle founders of the Frizelle Automative Group and co-owners of the Gold Coast Titans NRL Club.

Similar to previous years the cash splash continued along Mermaid Beach’s Multimillionaires’ Row.

A beachfront home at 213 Hedges Ave formerly owned by Harvey Norman Queensland boss Stephen Cavalier fetched $21.75m.

It was purchased by Stone & Wood Brewing Company director Ross Jurisich and Light Years Skin Studio founder Megan Jurisich.

Pub owner tourism entrepreneur and Computershare co-founder Chris Morris also sold his Hedges Ave mansion for a hefty $21m.

Amir Prestige principal Amir Mian said the Gold Coast’s most exclusive waterfront enclaves of Mermaid Beach Sovereign Island and Isle of Capri would always be in demand but somewhat more modest price growth could be expected through the remainder of 2022.

Mr Mian said interstate buyers particularly those from Melbourne were back in force now that they were able to inspect properties in person after border restrictions were abandoned.

“We weren’t sure if the flight to lifestyle destinations would carry on post-Covid — as it turns out interstate buyers are coming in cashed up and they are after a piece of paradise.

“There is a steady supply of buyers and yes we are getting a steady supply of sellers as well so it’s not going to be crazy crazy prices but I don’t see a fall in the prestige market” he said.

Mr Mian said returning expats would be the next wave of big-ticket buyers on the Coast.

Sunday more than 100000 people gathered on Hennepin Avenue to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the event. They were embraced by some of Minnesota's largest employers as well as a group of Democratic heavyweights who welcomed the crowds with a plea for political action in response to recent moves that they said threaten the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community.

Several pre-parade speakers denounced the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade noting that Justice Clarence Thomas proclaimed that the legal rationale for banning abortion should be used to overturn cases establishing rights to contraception same-sex consensual relations and same-sex marriage. The speakers urged attendees to get out and vote this fall for people who support their causes.

""They are coming for equality"" said Gov. Tim Walz who also marched in the parade next to Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan. ""They are coming for all of our rights. The good news is there's more of us. … The antidote to what we saw on Friday is you. It is all of our responsibility to create a world where every single child is seen heard loved and valued. Minnesota is that place.""

Andrea Jenkins president of the Minneapolis City Council warned the crowd that more than 300 anti-LGBTQ laws have been introduced throughout the U.S. recently with more than 100 of them passing in various states. She said conservatives are trying to legislate the LGBTQ community ""out of societal existence.""

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said the LGBTQ community has shown that it has political muscle of its own.

""Fifty years ago did we think we were going to have gay marriage? We did not"" Klobuchar told the crowd. ""Did we think we were going to get rid of things like 'Don't ask don't tell'? We did not. We have made so much progress. … This is a celebration of 50 years of progress but it is also a call for action for 50 more.""

Many crowd members said they welcomed the intrusion of politics on a day devoted to spreading messages of love inclusion and acceptance.

Pam Burd who has been coming to the Pride parade for 20 years said it was important for state leaders to show support for the LGBTQ community.

""I'm pretty disturbed by recent events"" said Burd who identifies as a gay woman. ""And I don't know what our future is. So I think our leaders need to be involved in everything that's going on.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was the most energetic politician on hand jogging down the route in shorts and pumping up the crowd outside Rock Bottom Brewery. In a call-and-responses session Frey shouted ""Happy!"" and the jubilant crowd shouted back ""Pride!""

Same-sex couples exchanged kisses and hugs sometimes on the route itself. The Timberwolves mascot drew huge cheers with his dance routine to Aretha Franklin's ""Respect."" The crowd also went delirious for bubbles and people sang along to a variety of hits.

""It was awesome"" said Tasia Desjarlait who brought her four kids to the parade for the first time. ""I feel great because the people going to the parade today feel free.""

Police said turnout was as large as before the pandemic. They reported no arrests or incidents related to the parade though a group of about 100 anti-police protesters briefly disrupted the beginning of the parade as they chanted ""No police at Pride"" and ""No justice no peace."" The group quickly moved to Loring Park organizers said.

The parade was an entertaining spectacle that lasted slightly more than two hours. Though it did not reach Mardi Gras levels there was a lot of exposed skin even though the weather never topped 70 degrees. One marcher wore nothing but a pair of white jockey shorts as he gyrated down Hennepin Avenue.

Still the parade was a fairly family-friendly event. Madusa Rose set up a face-painting station at 9th and Hennepin treating about 40 children to a free butterfly or other design. Rainbows symbolizing the LGBTQ flag were everywhere: on socks shirts capes dresses suits beads dogs — even rainbow-dyed hair.

Pat Meyer brought his three kids to the parade from St. Louis Park for the first time this year saying he did it to support his 13-year-old daughter who recently told the family she identifies as ""pansexual.""

""It opens up a lot of dialogues for us"" Meyer said while his two younger sons showed off their rainbow-colored gear. ""It's important for them to see there are no limitations to who you are.""

The parade drew some of Minnesota's biggest companies. A crew from Cargill carried signs saying ""We don't give a moo who you love"" and ""Labels are for jars not people."" Xcel Energy marched under a banner saying ""You. Us. Together."" Aveda workers wore T-shirts saying ""Be you. Do you.""

Robinson Walgreens Ameriprise Financial Cub Foods Pizza Luce and the Minnesota Twins and Timberwolves among others.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L25lYXJseS03LWhvdXJzLWhlYXZ5LW1ldGFsLW10bGV5LWNyZS1kZWYtbGVwcGFyZC1tYW55LW1vcmUtc291dGgtcGhpbGx5LTIwMjIwNjI2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 7 hours of heavy metal from Mötley Crüe Def Leppard and many more in South Philly,"After a two-year wait 90-degree heat wasn’t about to discourage the hard-rock faithful from turning out to Citizens Bank Park on Saturday for the straightforwardly named Stadium Tour. The monster package tour co-headlined by Mötley Crüe and Def Leppard with marquee-value support from Poison and Joan Jett was originally scheduled for the summer of 2020 then postponed twice for reasons that are by now all too familiar.

“You can’t kill Mötley Crüe” declared bassist Nikki Sixx during the band’s closing set nearly seven hours after the show had kicked off. “More importantly you can’t cancel Mötley Crüe.”

It’s not clear that anyone has been trying to other than the band members themselves. When they last played Philly at the Wells Fargo Center in 2015 the show was billed as the band’s Farewell Tour. Granted retirements never seem particularly permanent in the rock world but the Crüe had taken the typically over-the-top step of signing a so-called Cessation of Touring Agreement to make the finality legally binding.

Then after the 2019 Netflix biopic The Dirt suddenly made the fading rockers relevant to a new generation of fans they took the even more typically over-the-top step of physically blowing up the contract.

Vince Neil’s vocal performance now at 61 was an improvement on his 2015 appearance when he sounded atrociously out of shape wheezing and mumbling through much of the set. On Saturday his thin voice pitched into a shrill shriek in the higher range (and was somewhat buried in the thundering mix to compensate) but he kept pace and even summoned some of the piercing vigor of old on classics like “Live Wire” and “Looks That Kill.”

Drummer Tommy Lee also appeared to be on the mend after breaking four ribs just before the tour began. While Lee reportedly played only four or five songs on earlier shows he was behind the kit for nearly half of Crüe’s set in Philly splitting the gig with Tommy Clufetos drummer on Black Sabbath’s most recent reunion tour. Lee also played piano for the hit ballad “Home Sweet Home” on a rampway projecting from the stage into the crowd.

Def Leppard didn’t shy away from nostalgia — nearly half of the British band’s set was culled from their biggest album 1987′s Hysteria — but they were the one band of the day that transcended it. (Even young Los Angeles band Classless Act which played the thankless 3:45 p.m. opening set for a sparse crowd of early arrivals was an energetic throwback to a Sunset Strip golden age.)

For the most part an audience member who’d been cryogenically frozen at the first mention of the word “grunge” in the early ‘90s could’ve awoken on Saturday and still sung along with virtually every song of the day. But Leppard actually included four songs from their new album Diamond Star Halos which meshed perfectly with the classics.

The band’s refusal to concede that its best days are in the past went a long way toward making Def Leppard’s set the standout of the day. The voice of 62-year-old front man Joe Elliott sounded virtually untouched by the decades while the band threw itself into vital performances of career-spanning material from “Bringin’ on the Heartbreak” and “Rock of Ages” to power ballad “Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad.”

The five-piece band moved to the rampway for an acoustic mini-set that included Elliott’s solo rendition of “Two Steps Behind” and the new country-tinged song “This Guitar.” The megahit anthem “Pour Some Sugar on Me” brought audience members to their feet as the sun set for a rousing run of songs that ended Leppard’s appearance with “Photograph” accompanied by vintage snapshots of the band.

While Poison’s dopey sex-and-party glam has always fallen short of its peers the band can’t be faulted for enthusiasm. Bret Michaels remains the consummate front man winning over the still-filling stadium with irrepressible charm throughout the band’s hour-long set. Michaels leaned hard on the band members’ Pennsylvania roots name-checking Pottsville and Harrisburg while drummer Rikki Rockett sported a Phillies jersey. The midafternoon set drew entirely from Poison’s first three albums flashing images from hairspray-laden early videos as the band played exuberant renditions of “Talk Dirty To Me” and “Nothin’ But a Good Time.”

A video set to Bikini Kill’s “Rebel Girl” provided a brief history of Joan Jett before the 63-year-old rocker’s 4:30 p.m. set from her early days in the Runaways to her 2015 induction in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Struggling with her guitars in the sweltering heat the Wynnewood native presented the most raw rock performance of the day tearing through “Cherry Bomb” “I Love Rock ‘n Roll” and “Bad Reputation” among other hits with her black-clad band The Blackhearts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBsYWluc21hbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLzA2L2xldHRlci10by10aGUtZWRpdG9yLWFsYWJhbWEtc3R1ZGVudC1hY3RpdmlzdHMtdG8taG9sZC1yYWxseS1hZ2FpbnN0LW5ldy1wcmlzb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LETTER TO THE EDITOR | Alabama student activists to hold rally against new prisons,"Students protest outside of Regions Bank in Birmingham Ala. on Dec. 28 2020 for the bank's investment in CoreCivic a private prison development company.

The overturning of Roe v. Wade along with under-the-table planning has led one imminent human rights atrocity to remain largely unattended to by Alabama citizens. Billions of taxpayer dollars are about to be spent on facilities designed to incarcerate Alabamians for the next thirty years.

Don’t worry if you did not know about them because that was their intention. After Alabamians across the state collectively stopped the state from building three mega-prisons only a year ago they made a point to subvert the will of the people. In fact there is even a clause in the contracts stating that the banks are not allowed to cave under “activist pressure.""

Alabama intends to build two new prisons one in Elmore County and one in Escambia County. They have a stated capacity of 4000 prisoners each.

This will be funded by $400 million from the state’s COVID-19 relief funds which could very well go toward healthcare or economic relief for the citizens who have lost their livelihoods. $163 million will be transferred from the state’s general fund and $725 million in private bonds will be sold to fund the remainder of the project.

The aforementioned private bonds have a 30-year bond term so for investors to get their returns three more decades of incarceration for Alabamians will be guaranteed for the sake of making people money.

The state’s rationale for building new prisons can be traced back to the Department of Justice’s lawsuit in 2019 for the unconstitutional conditions inside its prisons. This lawsuit was not unprecedented as one was previously filed in 1996 that cited the same concerns to put it lightly that we are seeing now.

The lawsuit notes brutal violence specifically among staff. Although overcrowded conditions are highlighted it is explicitly stated that the construction will not solve the problems rampant in these facilities.

They provide funding for the construction of facilities for the provision of mental and physiological healthcare but they include nothing for the practitioners who would provide it. If the space cannot be adequately used due to staffing the only foreseeable use would be to house more people to hold more Alabamians captive in an oppressive and destructive system.

Draconian minimum sentencing laws which hopelessly incarcerate people for catastrophically long periods of time are the primary culprit for the current incarceration rate. Over 5660 people are currently serving life sentences or life without parole which encompass 26% of the overall Alabama Department of Corrections population. This makes immediate overcrowding of the prisons as soon as they are built inevitable.

They claim that they will close some of the prisons once the new ones are built. So they will either continue to incarcerate more people or the overcrowding issue will simply be moved to another facility. They’re using $1.3 billion parts of which Alabamans will foot the bill for to perpetuate a problem that they’re causing.

The lead banks underwriting the bonds are Stephens and Frazier-Lanier. Along with them Wells Fargo and Raymond-James are also underwriting and Regions is serving as a trustee.

Alabama Students Against Prisons along with other organizations from the Communities Not Prisons Coalition are organizing against this project. A rally is being held in Birmingham outside of the Wells Fargo and Regions Banks on 5th Avenue in Birmingham Alabama on June 27 at 9 a.m. We are asking all Alabamians to stand against this horrible waste of our financial resources.

Company officials and local leaders took turns applauding West Pharmaceutical Services’ expansion in Williamsport’s industrial park on Reach Road as part of groundbreaking ceremonies Wednesday.

The construction of a new 37000-square-foot facility they said represents the next step of an important economic investment for the company and the community.

“The addition will house rubber mixing equipment” David Lanzer director of operations for West in Williamsport said. “It’s a proprietary formula for rubber.”

The finished product — stoppers for IV bottles — will then be completed at the West facility in Jersey Shore. The compounded rubber product has been produced at West sites in Florida and North Carolina.

“This site has been part of the West community since 1982” Lanzer told those gathered at the site.

West is a manufacturer in packaging injectable solutions and delivery systems and a partner to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide.

Construction is expected to be completed next year.

Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce President Jason Fink said the expansion represents the next step for West to fulfill its mission to customers and the community.

The project coordinated by the Governor’s Action Team will create more than 200 jobs at the company’s three Pennsylvania locations.

“We need to continue to invest in our facilities” Tom Gribbin vice president of operations said.

Overall he said the company has experienced “significant growth.”

Brent Vernon executive director Governor’s Action Team said the West expansion represents a major investment as part of the critical work — that of saving lives — done by West.

He said the team worked extensively with West to help make the project happen.

“This really is a big deal” state Sen. Gene Yaw R-Loyalsock Township said. “It’s a big deal for my district. It’s a big deal for the state.”

In looking for places to locate a company not only chooses to go where it is welcome but where it is appreciated Yaw noted.

“They stay where they are appreciated” he said. “West is appreciated.”

Yaw announced that $500000 in state funding was secured for the expansion.

Lycoming County Commissioner Scott Metzger noted the company’s commitment to producing products that enhance lives.

Jernae Drummond assistant director for Williamsport Community & Economic Development said the West expansion is another example of efforts by the city to bring more jobs and businesses to the community.

Fink said “West is hiring. It offers great wages.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nutanix AHV Virtualization delivers enterprise-grade secure virtualization capabilities such as core virtual machine (VM) operations VM high availability live migration and virtual network management.

Nutanix natively converges compute and storage into a single appliance that can be deployed in minutes to run an application out of the box and integrated features of the infrastructure stack rather than stand-alone products that require separate deployment and management.

Nutanix AHV Virtualization has a large ecosystem of technology partners and validated software solutions that enhance user solutions and features. AHV is the native Nutanix hypervisor that offers substantial benefits to IT administrators by simplifying the infrastructure life cycle steps from buying and deploying to managing scaling and supporting. In addition AHV delivers a virtualization solution based on proven open-source Linux virtualization which is without the cost and complexity of other solutions.

See below to learn all about Nutanix AHV Virtualization and where it stands in the virtualization sector:

Nutanix and virtualization market

The virtualization market value was $62.7 billion in 2020.

The market is expected to reach $120.41 billion by 2026 registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2021 to 2026.

Nutanix AHV features

Nutanix AHV Virtualization is a feature-rich virtualization software product designed for enterprises IT professionals and developers. The AHV platform can be managed from a single pane of glass with Nutanix Prism that provides integrated capabilities for cluster management and VM management.

Backup APIs

Nutanix AHV Virtualization publishes a rich API set that supports external backup vendors. The backup APIs use changed region tracking and build an integration to perform full incremental and differential backups. Changed region tracking is always on in AHV clusters and backups can be either crash consistent or application consistent.

Moreover the backup APIs are an instant-recovery feature that enables supported backup vendors to instantly recover a VM or vDisk typically on their backup appliance and allow immediate access to its contents.

Analytics

Administrators can use Prism views to monitor infrastructure stack components and Nutanix Prism offers in-depth analytics for every element in the infrastructure stack including hardware storage and VMs.

Nutanix also features multiple charts with CPU- and storage-based reports around resource usage and performance and virtual disks with in-depth data points that focus on I/O types I/O metrics read the source cache hits working set size and latency. In addition it offers a VM NICs configuration summary for a VM as well as a list of all snapshots for a VM with the ability to clone or restore from the snapshot or to delete the snapshot.

VM management

Nutanix AHV Virtualization focuses on creating updating deleting protecting the data and monitoring VMs and resources. The cluster services and features are all available through the Prism interface a distributed management layer.

AHV also allows administrators to create VMs and perform many operations on selected VMs including power cycle reset restart snapshot and clone migrate pause and launch a remote console. AHV provides several useful services including image management VM templates OVA import and export and intelligent VM placement.

Differentiators

Cross-hypervisor and live migration

Nutanix simplifies migrating processes for existing VMs between an ESXi cluster and an AHV cluster with built-in data protection capabilities. It allows users to create one or more protection domains on the source cluster and set the AHV cluster as the target remote cluster.

In addition live migration allows the system to move VMs from one host to another which can occur when the user places a host in maintenance mode. The user can use it to migrate VMs to another physical cluster or location or avoid planned interruptions.

Automated high availability

Acropolis Dynamic Scheduling (ADS) is an automatic function enabled on every AHV cluster to avoid hot spots in cluster nodes that offers VM high availability (VMHA) and the Acropolis Leader tracks host health by monitoring connections to the libvirt on all cluster hosts. Users can also configure an AHV cluster for HA with resource reservation to guarantee that the resources required to restart VMs are always available.

Further Metro Availability creates a global file system namespace across Nutanix clusters and uses synchronous replication.

GPU support and security

Nutanix AHV Virtualization allows installing physical GPU cards in qualified hosts and presenting them to guest VMs using GPU Passthrough or vGPU mode. With GPU Passthrough AHV can pass a GPU through to a VM and AHV enables the user to live-migrate VMs with vGPU assignments.

The fully integrated Nutanix infrastructure stack eliminates security risks associated with legacy solutions that involve many vendors with a narrow fragmented view of security and to reduce the security surface area. As a result users can turn off many of the services AHV makes unnecessary.

Nutanix AHV Virtualization use cases

Nutanix AHV Virtualization is one of the most popular virtualization platforms that are using different types of users and the different sizes of organizations.

“With Nutanix AHV we have been able to enhance our backup and recovery options allowing us to quickly recover and replicate across our WAN links.

“Many of our critical systems and applications are now running on Citrix and Nutanix. That’s the faith we have in the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud platform.” -Armando Muniz manager of IT system engineering JetBlue

“It took us less than a week to become comfortable with AHV. AHV is a simple solution with everything we need displayed in one console and we love the one-click non-disruptive upgrades. We also don’t miss the nighttime upgrades or the inefficient silos of a separate NAS.” -Dan Feliz general manager of IT infrastructure JetBlue

“We trust AHV because it is based on the proven KVM hypervisor technology and has been hardened to meet our stringent security needs. Before Nutanix centrally managing our open source KVM environment was a challenge. … The out-of-the-box experience is fantastic and AHV has all of the features we need. It gives us failover capabilities resource management and the ability to easily obtain great performance metrics — without all of the expensive licensing for additional software. Nutanix AHV is one of the most solid infrastructure and virtualization technologies I have seen.” -Jake Yang senior director of global systems Nasdaq

But there was just one 23-time major champion on the grass at the All England Club.

Seven-time Wimbledon champ Serena Williams hadn't played a singles match since retiring because of a torn hamstring in her opener a year ago.

Tennis Major Pick 'Em Make your picks and compete for a chance to win $1000! Make Your Picks

On Tuesday Williams faced off against Harmony Tan in the first round of the 2022 tournament and while she looked rusty in her eventual defeat she still displayed moments of brilliance.

Outside of tennis it's not like she has kept a low profile over the past year. From movie premieres to the Oscars to furthering her business empire Williams has basically been taking over the world.

Let's take a look back at what she has been up to between Wimbledons.

June 29 2021: After her devastating exit at Wimbledon Williams followed up with an Instagram post later that day in which she said she was ""heartbroken"" but grateful for the fan support.

Aug. 25 2021: One day before the draw reveal Williams announced she would not be playing at the US Open because of the same injury which she now confirmed was a torn hamstring. Citing the need to give her body time to ""heal completely"" Williams ended the message with an optimistic ""I'll see you soon.""

Sept. 13 2021: Naomi Osaka was a co-chair of the Met Gala and US Open finalists Emma Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez cemented their ""It girl"" statuses but it was Williams who ruled the red carpet at the famed (and pandemic-delayed) event.

Plus her and sister Venus' surprising photos with former foe Maria Sharapova had everyone talking for days.

Sept. 26 2021: While Williams doesn't celebrate the day for religious reasons the rest of the tennis world was very aware of her 40th birthday and there were countless tributes online including from her husband Alexis Ohanian. She seemed to be living her best life while vacationing on the beach with Alexis and daughter Olympia.

November 2021: With the impending release of ""King Richard"" the biopic about their father and first coach Serena and Venus Williams made the media rounds to help promote the film. The pair graced the cover of ""Entertainment Weekly"" with star Will Smith appeared on his family's ""Red Table Talk"" series and attended several premieres. A solo Serena stopped by ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" to talk about the movie -- and even teased her return to competition by answering affirmatively to a question about being ready for the Australian Open. ""Definitely"" she said.

Dec. 8 2021: While it seemed as if a trip Down Under was in her future during her late-night interview Williams dashed the hopes of her fans with a statement to the Australia Open's official website the following month. ""While this is never an easy decision to make I am not where I need to be physically to compete"" she said. ""Melbourne is one of my favorite cities to visit and I look forward to playing at the AO every year. I will miss seeing the fans but am excited to return and compete at my highest level.""

Jan. 17 2022: Williams wasn't on the court on the first day of play at the Australian Open but her daughter was -- and showing off her impressive two-handed backhand during a lesson that quickly went viral. (It's the follow-through for us.) Williams had previously revealed that Olympia was taking tennis lessons and insisted she would not be the one coaching her. Still that didn't stop Venus from commenting ""It's Oracene all over again!"" in reference to their mom who coached them alongside their father in their early days in the sport.

Feb. 13 2022: The Los Angeles Rams were the Super Bowl champions but even on one of sports and marketing's biggest days of the year Williams was one of the biggest winners. In a commercial for Michelob Ultra co-starring with a virtual who's who of A-list athletes including Peyton Manning Alex Morgan Nneka Ogwumike and Jimmy Butler Williams made the grandest entrance of them all.

Feb. 28 2022: In a star-studded tribute show to the late designer and her former on-court outfit collaborator Virgil Abloh Williams walked the Off-White runway at Paris Fashion Week.

March 1 2022: Appearing on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Williams shared that her investment firm Williams Ventures raised $110 million in its inaugural round of fundraising. Per the New York Times Williams Ventures was already an active angel investor in more than 60 companies. She's not a business(wo)man she's a business man.

""The reason I started @SerenaVentures is because I feel like the venture capital ecosystem really needs an inclusive player and a player with a platform to make the necessary intact change at scale"" says @SerenaWilliams on raising $111M inaugural fund. pic.twitter.com/JVwnIjVXyB — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) March 1 2022

March 27 2022: With ""King Richard"" nominated in several categories including Best Picture Serena and Venus were given the honor of opening the Academy Awards by introducing Beyoncé's tennis-themed performance of ""Be Alive"" from the film.

And that's it. Nothing else interesting happened at the Oscars. Nope. Nothing at all.

""Ladies and gentleman Beyoncé!""

April 7 2022: Williams' longtime coach Patrick Mouratoglou stunned the tennis world by announcing he would be working with Simona Halep who defeated Williams in the 2019 Wimbledon final on a full-time basis. ""I had a conversation with Serena and the door opened for me at least short term to work with someone else"" Mouratoglou wrote in a post on social media.

Speculation was immediate about what the move meant for Williams' future in the sport but she wasted no time in dispelling such rumors. While at a bitcoin conference in Miami later that day Williams posted a video to her Instagram story with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and indicated she would be back for Wimbledon.

""We've been talking about my comeback and [Rodgers has] been hyping me up and getting me ready for Wimbledon"" Williams said.

The video ended with Rodgers saying ""She's back"" while pointing at Williams.

Serena Williams nods at a Wimbledon return with Aaron Rodgers as her hype man.

April 21 2022: Already an investor in Angel City FC of the NWSL and the NFL's Miami Dolphins Williams looked to expand her ownership empire by joining an ultimately failed bid for Chelsea FC. Led by Martin Broughton the chairman of British Airways and alongside the likes of F1 superstar Lewis Hamilton Williams reportedly pledged $13 million to the group.

April 27 2022: Nike unveils the ""Serena Williams Building"" at its global headquarters in Beaverton Oregon. At 1 million square feet or 140 full-size tennis courts according to Nike it's the largest building on the campus and features labs showrooms a library and a 140-seat Olympia Theater named after Serena's daughter of course.

""When I was just a kid I visited the Nike campus and I saw that athletes get buildings"" Serena wrote on Instagram. ""After that visit I knew I wanted two things; to be a Nike athlete and to have a building. I set my goals high. I knew I would have to be elite and not only the best but someone that changes the course of sport.

""And now here we are -- officially unveiling the Serena building at the Nike campus. Blood sweat and many tears many trophies -- it is beyond an honor and giving me chill bumps.""

May 3 2022: In a wide-ranging interview with Ellen DeGeneres Williams talked about her business acumen Beyoncé and Olympia's potential in the sport (""Are you asking as a mom or like an athlete?"") but also hinted about a potential return to competition. Responding to DeGeneres asking if she still played a lot Williams didn't hesitate.

""I play all the time"" Williams said. ""I haven't played recently but I'm actually going to get back on the court in a couple days.""

May 22 2022: The French Open was underway in Paris. Unlike the previous two majors Williams didn't issue a statement about not playing and fans were left to guess what her latest absence meant. She didn't acknowledge the tournament on any of her social media accounts but did post throughout.

Tournament champion Iga Swiatek surpassed second-place Serena and tied Venus for the longest win streak (35) since 2000 by winning the title -- and it was clear how much that distinction meant to her.

""Having that 35th win and doing something more than Serena did it's something special"" Swiatek said. ""Because I always wanted to have some kind of a record. In tennis it's pretty hard after Serena's career. So basically that really hit me.""

June 3 2022: Williams' name did not appear on the just-released entry list for Wimbledon thus furthering rumors about her time in the sport. While her ranking had fallen out of the top 200 (and is now at 1208) she would have been able to use her protected ranking to secure a spot in the main draw.

June 10 2022: Williams posted a picture of herself standing alongside banana trees with a cryptic caption: ""I'm thinking of something that may make you go bananas ... stay tuned!""

Many commenters believed this is a sign she will be playing at Wimbledon.

June 14 2022: Underneath an Instagram photo of an unmistakable grass court featuring her wrapped-up ankles and racket bag Williams posted the caption her fans had been waiting for: ""SW and SW19. It's a date. 2022 See you there.""

While it was immediately unclear if she received a wild card or was solely playing doubles Wimbledon organizers cleared it up soon after by announcing she had received a wild card. It was also announced she will be playing doubles at Eastbourne with Ons Jabeur the week before the major. Jabeur later told the WTA she was ""over the moon"" about the opportunity.

June 21 2022: Williams made her return to competition playing just doubles at Eastbourne with Jabeur. After dropping the first set in their opener the duo came back to win the match -- and ultimately made a run to the semifinals before having to withdraw because of Jabeur's knee injury. Even in the short time the #Onsrena pairing still provided plenty of viral moments.

How about some ONSRENA highlights?! :movie_camera:@Ons_Jabeur & @serenawilliams cooking up a feast in Eastbourne :female-cook::female-cook: — wta (@WTA) June 22 2022

Also as was noted in this tweet the fact that Serena made her comeback on the same day as Beyoncé released her new single feels like an auspicious sign for the future.

June 28 2022: Williams lost to 115th-ranked Harmony Tan of France 7-5 1-6 7-6 (10-7). Even with a year off of singles competition and no small amount of rust it took 3 hours and 10 minutes for Tan to finally defeat her. She was even just two points from advancing in the third set but couldn't quite pull it off. If this is the last Wimbledon for Williams it was an entertaining one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tcnQvbmFtZS9jdXJ0aXMtbWV3Ym91cm5lLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM1MzgwNTI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Curtis Mewbourne Obituary (1935 - 2022) - Englewood CO - Midland Reporter-Telegram,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/mrt/name/curtis-mewbourne-obituary?id=35380529 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tcnQvbmFtZS9jdXJ0aXMtbWV3Ym91cm5lLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM1MzgwNTI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcHJlc2NvdHRlbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9vcGluaW9uLWltcGVhY2gtZW5lbWllcy1vZi10aGUtY29uc3RpdHV0aW9uLWJ1ei13aWxsaWFtcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Impeach Enemies of the Constitution – Buz Williams,"“A good deal of tryanny goes by the name of protection.” – Crystal Eastman

All Supreme Court Justices and most elective office holders in the Federal government take an oath to “defend our Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.” The President’s oath states the he will “preserve protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” The sad fact is that many who take the oaths of their office loathe the Constitution and actively try to circumvent weaken or destroy that hallowed document. This has been going on for more than a century. Those who attempt to do that trying to evade the Amendment process should be impeached from whatever office they hold.

A number of Amendments to our Constitution have been violated diminished or ignored by many of our elected and appointed officials federal judges and Justices of the Supreme Court. The First Amendment protects several freedoms. It protects our right to freely “exercise” our various religions. A number of states locked down churches during the COVID pandemic thus extinguishing that right in the name of protection. The individuals not the government state or federal should decide if they want to risk getting a disease by attending religious services.

Leftists have proposed legislation to ban “hate speech”. A lot of countries have already done so. Thank God our Supreme Court has consistently ruled that “hate speech” laws are detrimental to the First Amendment. Many of our college campuses have rules that prohibit “hate speech” and have expelled or suspended students and fired professors who have violated the school’s definition of “hate speech”. The proponents of “hate speech” laws and rules use broad definitions. This is intentional so they can use it for those whose opinions differ from theirs.

Rather than let their users and readers decide for themselves the social media giants ban shadow ban or warn against opinions that differ from leftist agenda. While this isn’t a violation of the Constitution itself it does violate the spirit of the First Amendment. These companies have so much influence and monopolistic power that they need to be broken up by Antitrust laws like the monopolies of the late 1800s.

For the last few decades the Supreme Court has continuously protected the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms. Federal and state legislators and other elected officials still try to limit and/or emasculate that right as if they can’t understand the phrase “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

The 4th Amendment right for us to be “secure in our persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures” is being violated daily by the government working in conjunction with private companies. They are able to intercept computer and phone communications of US citizens without a warrant.

Many “red flag” laws and proposed laws call for the confiscation of property without due process in violation of the 5th Amendment.

A large number of those who the progressives have accused of being “insurrectionist” have been held for months thus being deprived of their right to a speedy trial in violation of the 6th Amendment. Many of those labeled as “insurrectionist” have been held in solitary confinement without the benefit of bail or legal counsel in violation of 6th and 8th Amendments.

The 10th Amendment reserves rights for the individual states. The Federal government has historically pushed their power into these areas reserved for the individual states. Row v Wade is a prime example. The states are allowed to make laws both criminal and civil and the federal government and courts violate the 10th Amendment when they make or overrule laws of which that are the purview of the states.

The proper way to change the Constitution is to go through the Amendment process. This is a difficult process no doubt but it was made that way so that it would not be swayed by fads or trends in communities or culture.

Any federal elected or appointed officials judges or justices who attempt or have attempted to change the meaning of the Constitution without going through the Amendment process should be impeached. It doesn’t matter if they have tried to do this by passing laws that circumvent the Constitution or by judicial fiat they have violated their oath and that is an impeachable offense.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbm5pczM2NS5jb20vbmV3cy9zZXJlbmEtd2lsbGlhbXMtdGFyZ2V0cy13aW1ibGVkb24tZ2xvcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Serena Williams on working vacation at All England Club,"Serena Williams joked she has put her ‘out of office’ on as she takes a break from her hectic off-court life to tread the lawns of Wimbledon once again.

Suspicions had been growing that the 23-time grand slam singles champion had effectively retired having not been seen on a tennis court since withdrawing in tears during her first-round match at the All England Club 12 months ago with a hamstring injury.

Williams’ prolific Instagram account has instead been full of her business ventures and showbiz lifestyle with promotion of ‘King Richard’ the Oscar-winning film about her childhood as well as her role as mother to four-year-old Olympia.

“A part of me feels like that is a little bit more of my life now than tournaments” she said.

“When you do have a venture company you do have to go all-in. It definitely takes literally all my extra time. And it’s fun. I’m currently out of office for the next few weeks so if you email me you’ll get the nice ‘out of office’ reply.

“Everyone knows that I’ll be back in a few weeks. But it’s good. I absolutely love what I do. I love investing in companies.

“And then the Oscars was really fun just the whole tour of that whole moment was incredible to be a part of such an amazing movie. It was something that you don’t think about. At best you think of winning grand slams not being nominated for an Oscar for a film that you produce.”

Williams revealed her decision to play at Wimbledon was made before the French Open with her first matches of the year coming in doubles in Eastbourne earlier this week with Ons Jabeur.

Of her break from the sport she said: “I didn’t retire. I just needed to heal physically mentally. I had no plans to be honest. I just didn’t know when I would come back.

“I didn’t know how I would come back. Obviously Wimbledon is such a great place to be and it just kind of worked out.”

Williams has made no secret of her desire to add to her grand slam haul which would see her finally draw level with Margaret Court at the top of the all-time standings.

She has made four grand slam finals since returning from maternity leave including two at Wimbledon in 2018 and 2019 but has not won a set.

Williams would surely not have made the trip across the Atlantic unless she thought she had a chance of lifting the trophy again and asked what her goal for the tournament is she said with a smile: “You know the answer to that. Come on now.”

Another motivation was to potentially write a different ending to her Wimbledon story after last year’s unfortunate exit.

“It was always something since the match ended that was always on my mind” she said. “So it was a tremendous amount of motivation for that.”

Serena Williams retired from her first round ladies’ singles match against Aliaksandra Sasnovich in 2021 (Adam Davy/PA)

As to whether this is her final Wimbledon appearance the mercurial American added: “I don’t know. I can only tell you that I’m here. Who knows where I’ll pop up next. You’ve just got to be ready.”

Williams was one of the A-list players given the chance to hit on the main show courts ahead of the tournament in an effort to avoid the sort of incident that befell her last year.

She followed world number one Iga Swiatek onto Centre Court on Friday and the Pole who is bidding to continue a 35-match winning streak dating back to February revealed she was too shy to say hello.

“When I saw her yesterday I was pretty overwhelmed” said the 21-year-old. “I felt like I am still kind of new. I didn’t know how to react perfectly. I wanted to meet her.

“I saw that she had so many people around her. I don’t know her team. It was pretty weird. I came back to myself a few years earlier when I was too shy to say hi to anybody for a second.”

Iga Swiatek admitted to being star-struck when faced with Williams (Adam Davy/PA)

Swiatek will play in the main draw for only the third time with last year’s run to the fourth round her best performance so far.

She goes into the tournament as the hot favourite but said: “Honestly I still feel like I need to figure out grass. I didn’t have a lot of time to prepare. But I’m just trying to stay open-minded and kind of take positives from the situation.

“I have so much successes this season that I don’t have to show everybody that I need to play well in every tournament because it’s tennis we have ups and downs. So I try to play without expectations and just see what this tournament brings me."

Details have emerged on Southern Nevada’s next big casino-resort project which will include a major sports and entertainment arena.

Last week Tim Leiweke and partner Irving Azoff of the Los Angeles-based Oak View Group named the executives that will drive development of the 2000-room OVG Las Vegas Hotel & Casino and its adjacent 20000-seat NBA-ready arena.

They’re Randy Morton former co-CEO of the Foley Entertainment Group and a four-decade hospitality executive with experience as president and chief operating officer of Bellagio and Marc Badain the longtime former president of the Raiders who helped relocate the team to Las Vegas from Oakland and guided construction of the $2 billion 65000-seat Allegiant Stadium.

The $3 billion project — $1 billion of which is dedicated to the arena — will be built on about 25 acres at Las Vegas Boulevard and Blue Diamond Road right next to Interstate 15 and 1½ miles south of Interstate 215.

Morton and Badain talked with the Review-Journal about the project which will break ground next year and is expected to be ready to open in 2026 (the interview has been edited for brevity and clarity):

Review-Journal: What was the biggest factor in your decision to sign on with this new project?

Randy Morton: My decision when I was approached by Tim Leiweke who shared the vision of the project was based on my being very excited to have the opportunity to get back into the casino-hotel world after 19½ years at Bellagio. Re-entering the market on the casino and hotel side was very exciting and very challenging and I really look forward to working with the Oak View Group Tim and the team and working side by side with Marc Badain.

Marc Badain: I’d add very similar thoughts. Obviously I’ve known Tim a very long time. He’s pretty much a legend in the sports world when you look at what he’s done the last five or six years building Oak View Group into the powerhouse that it is. When he approached me probably around the new year and explained his vision of what he wanted to do here for a live music venue and an arena and integrating the resort into it it was pretty hard to say no. He’s a hard guy to say no to anyway but then when he presented this concept and what he was looking to accomplish here especially on the heels of the three or four successful projects that he and the team at Oak View Group have completed in the last 24 months it was pretty easy to say yes.

What are some of the details you can share about this resort and arena project?

Badain: I’ll start on the arena side. We’re looking to build the greatest arena on Earth and Las Vegas needs it and Las Vegas deserves it. If you look at the trajectory of music venues and sports venues in Las Vegas of this size it’s about every 10 years for a new one. You could go back over time and see that evolution of facilities. By the time we open our venue it will be about 10 years since they opened T-Mobile (Arena) and it’s time to have a new venue in Las Vegas that’s worthy of Las Vegas. The market has shown its ability to absorb new venues and has enough capacity and enough programming to do it. It’s time to put the investment behind it and the folks at Oak View Group are the best in the world at doing it and have just completed a number of venues and bring all of that expertise and all the best practices from those venues and apply them to Las Vegas.

Morton: We’re at the early stages and and obviously this is day 2 for me so it’s very exciting with the early stages with master-planning and design and development of a luxury boutique casino-resort. The integration of the arena and the connectivity to the site is very exciting. And I love the location. It’s easy in easy out with multiple ways in off I-15 and of course I-215 which is very exciting and very appealing to all customers. I’m starting the process with Gensler (one of the design architects) and with Marc and we’re very excited to be working on the master-planning and get going on the layout of the flow of the project. It’s easy in and out off Las Vegas Boulevard South into this amazing casino-resort and arena.

2000-room resort

How many rooms will you have?

Morton: We’re working on 2000 rooms including all rooms and suites. That’s really what we’re calling a luxury boutique casino-resort.

How about the arena size?

Badain: 20000 (seats) is the target to start with and we’ll take a look at some design options and what’s the best capacity for the demand incorporating that into what Randy is talking about with the resort. We want to make sure the size of the arena makes sense for the property and for the live music world going forward and what they really want out of that experience. Is it better to have a little smaller venue than 20000 or should we go larger? We’ll take a look at all the options and put together an optimal plan.

Randy you’ve worked for MGM Resorts International. Do you have any reservations about going up against the big players in Las Vegas including Caesars Entertainment Wynn Resorts Ltd. and your former employer?

Morton: I’m excited about the opportunity to get back into the luxury hotel-casino business. Before Bellagio I was with Four Seasons Hotels for 19 years all over the continental U.S. at many luxury properties. For me I’m very excited about the opportunity to come back to the casino-hotel business after a great year working as co-CEO for the Foley Entertainment Group working for Bill Foley. This is an incredible opportunity for me to get back into the luxury business. It’s very competitive and I’m very competitive Marc’s very competitive and Tim Leiweke’s very competitive so we’re excited to start working on this project and really build something special.

NBA-ready

Marc will you be able to leverage some of your professional sports experience toward attracting a major sports tenant to the arena?

Badain: What we’ve said publicly is what I’ll say to you: We’ll build an NBA-ready venue but it’s not our decision. Decisions are made at the league level. There are 30 owners and they’ll decide where they want to expand if they want to expand. I know there’s been a lot of chatter in the media but we’re going to stay out of that chatter and we’re going to be very respectful of the process and when the ownership group in the NBA and the commissioner of the NBA decide they want to expand we’ll have a venue that’s ready for them and if they want to be in the Las Vegas market we’ll be an option for them.

So are there any updates on the prospect of attracting an NBA team?

Badain: I don’t have anything to share at this time that we haven’t already said. That’s their process. They’ve said some things probably in terms of timing and it’s our job just to build an NBA-ready venue and be ready for that discussion when they’re ready to have it.

Soccer stadium?

Are there any updates on whether a Major League Soccer stadium could be built on land adjacent to your project?

Badain: That’s not our land but we’ve had some discussions with representatives of Wes Edens’ group. They’re working on the Brightline rail station for that piece of property as well. There’s three main property owners. There’s the piece of property that we bought the property that Wes owns and there’s a property to the north and all three property owners have stayed in communication over the last couple of months just to make sure we coordinate things from infrastructure standpoints (Clark) County approval standpoints and to make sure all our projects are going to complement each other. There is communication but in terms of where they are on the soccer stadium but I don’t want to speculate or speak for them. You’d have to ask them where they are. But we’ve heard the same things you have which is they have the rights to the expansion franchise and that’s the location they’ve looked at for a potential stadium.

People don’t realize just how much land is there and what can be done with it.

Badain: You really have about a 270-acre parcel when you take a look at that piece of land. I think you remember that was one of the locations that was mentioned for the (Allegiant) Stadium site five or six years ago. The rail station gives you a chance to really add to the density of the entire parcel. So if you have our project on 25 acres and then there’s 41 additional acres that’s part of our parcel that will be developed and then there’s about a 110-acre parcel for the high-speed rail station and a soccer stadium and then another 60-plus-acre parcel north of that. So you’re really talking about a massive amount of development that’s going to occur there over the next five to 10 years. When you talk about the high-speed-rail station I know they have some very exciting plans for what they may build around it in terms of potential mixed use whether it’s commercial space residential space hotel space stadium space. You have a lot of options there and it’s one of the last major pieces of undeveloped land on Las Vegas Boulevard.

Transportation connections

What are some of the advantages to locating next door to the planned high-speed-rail train station connecting to Southern California?

Morton: The transportation is very important obviously with the incredible Harry Reid International Airport nearby the drive-in traffic the changes and growing demand for Lyft and Uber and of course the Brightline train potentially coming into the site certainly would be very exciting and very welcomed certainly for all of our customers that would come from Southern California. What a great option for transportation to come for a two- three- or four-day visit to Las Vegas arriving on the Brightline train. It sounds like a really brilliant business plan.

With what’s planned it seems like you’ll capture different audiences for sports concerts shows and conventions.

Badain: I think that’s spot on. You’re going to have a live music entertainment venue for concerts and other events like you spoke of. Because it’s integrated into a resort property you can incorporate any of the large-scale events going on at the hotel and you can utilize the arena as a venue and support for what’s going on inside the resort.

It sounds like plenty of cross-marketing opportunities.

Badain: Absolutely. When you talk about what the consumers are looking for they can check into their room and never leave the property and utilize all the services that the resort that Randy’s going to put together can offer. You can walk directly into an arena and see a concert without ever having to leave the comfort of the destination.

This property is farther south than most of what’s on Las Vegas Boulevard. Do you see the resort corridor shifting south?

Morton: I love the location in south Las Vegas from the access standpoint and from the connection to I-15 and I-215. The ease of getting in and out of this property will certainly benefit the casino business seven days a week. The trending luxury business is really going to drive weekends and we’re going to be very focused on the MICE (meetings incentives conventions and expositions) business on weekdays which will be very successful. The location fits perfectly for the connectivity to the arena the access to the hotel-casino to the arena.

Will there be convention facilities or will the arena fit that need?

Morton: The arena will be available for convention business and corporate business but also there will be convention space in the hotel-casino property.

So ballrooms meeting rooms things like that?

Morton: Correct.

Oversaturation of arenas?

There has been some not-so-subtle commentary about Las Vegas being oversaturated with arenas. Your thoughts?

Badain: I don’t think Randy and I would sign on and I don’t think Tim and Oak View Group would make the investment if we thought Las Vegas was oversaturated. Again I’ll point back to the history and the evolutions of arenas and the use of the arenas in Las Vegas going back to the Thomas & Mack Center to the Orleans Arena to the Michelob Ultra Arena the (MGM) Grand Garden Arena the T-Mobile to the (Madison Square Garden) Sphere and to our project. Vegas has shown an ability to absorb those venues. The live entertainment business is not going anywhere. It’s really the most lucrative part of the entertainment business live performances. The need for those spaces is not going away. I don’t have any doubts in my mind about the ability for Las Vegas to support another venue.

And Oak View with all its arenas nationwide is very connected to the entertainment scene right?

Badain: Absolutely.

That was until she joined the Proctor/Hermantown/Marshall Mirage a girls program formed in 1998 in a move sped up by a parental complaint filed just a year earlier.

This? Think of the Bad News Bears … on ice. And that didn’t sit well with the goalie.

“Rachelle didn’t get much support” said longtime Mirage coach Glen Gilderman. “Our very first scrimmage we went up to I think it was Grand Rapids and it was really bad. The Proctor girls soccer team had gone to state that year so we didn’t have some of our best players and it was brutal. She was yelling at the players ‘Get out of the way! Just move just move out my way’ (he laughed). She knew they were not very good. They didn’t know how to play like a team yet or anything like that.’”

Gilderman told her not to worry it would get better and it did get better. A lot better. Gilderman quickly helped build the program into a winner and in 2021 with Emma Stauber at the helm the Mirage reached the pinnacle winning their first Class A state title.

Hard to believe now years later it was a bit of a fight just to get the thing started. Thursday marked the 50th anniversary of Title IX the landmark legislation that opened the way for girls sports by prohibiting sex-based discrimination in any school or program receiving federal funding.

While Francisco then known as Rachelle Hernesman initially regretted her decision to join that team she no longer does now.

“A lot of people to this day don’t realize I played at Hermantown that long” Francisco said. “I played for the boys junior varsity and then went over to be the first goalie on the girls varsity. That is pretty special because for so long they said no you can’t have a team. I just think about the girls that are playing now. I’ve watched a lot of their games and they’re excellent hockey players. It’s just come so far. It’s neat to see that and it’s more fair now for girls and boys.”

The original complaint

According to a Duluth News Tribune article dated Sept. 18 1997 Hermantown’s school board appealed a state order from earlier in the month to add a high school girls hockey program to satisfy Title IX gender equity laws. The Minnesota Department of Children Families and Learning found that girls had 20% fewer opportunities than boys to participate in athletics at Hermantown.

A low level of interest and potential lack of numbers were cited in the appeal.

“That didn’t turn out to be as big of a problem as they thought because we worked really hard to get kids out” Gilderman said. “You had some girls who were really serious and you had a group that was just happy to be playing hockey and then you had a group that I had to go recruit out of the halls. That first year I just needed kids who could skate — and stop.”

According to the article the department’s order came in response to a complaint filed in February 1997 by Hermantown hockey parent Dan Harvieux. While the likes of Angela Harvieux and Sheila (Radzak) Johnson never got to realize the dream of being part of that team the complaint got the ball rolling.

“And the Mirage was born” Gilderman said.

Gilderman heard the news the team was forming and it piqued his interest. He was working in Proctor as a middle-school teacher at the time and had some experience as a goalie coach. He went into the office of Proctor athletic director Jeff Caywood in the spring of 1998 to tell Caywood about his interest in being an assistant coach.

“I don’t think he looked very hard” Gilderman said. “A couple days later he said ‘Hey we can’t find anybody. Would you be interested in being the head coach?’ And I said ‘Nah I don’t want to do that. You need to find somebody.’ But like I said I don’t think he looked very hard.”

Perfect person for the job

Gilderman 57 a 1983 Proctor graduate is about as mild-mannered as it gets. He understood the importance of what they were doing the importance of equality and the importance of what it means to treat everyone the same boy or girl.

The program was under scrutiny the first few years. Gilderman remembers people standing in the windows above the rink with clipboards taking notes making sure they weren’t “stealing ice time” from the boys.

“It was weird” he said. “But we ran a very efficient practice so they got bored and left.”

Another time in those early years the Mirage were up on the range and Gilderman was taken aback by what he heard before a game as the opposing coach told him they didn’t flood between the first and second periods for girls games.

“And I said ‘Really?’’’ Gilderman recalled. “And he said ‘Yeah there’s a lot of pressure for ice time and I said ‘You know what you have to start battling here for these girls because do they do that for the boys?’ Well no. And this guy was a great coach and a great guy but he was new and didn’t really know. That’s the bottom line: everything is the same.”

Gilderman told his athletic directors what was going on and the next time up there the Zamboni made the rounds between the first and second periods as it should.

Gilderman also remembered not even having pregame introductions with the starting lineups.

“They treated the girls varsity team like a youth program like peewees or bantams” Gilderman said. “All these programs all over the place have earned an equal status. It’s treated equally now but there’s still … there’s still a battle that has to happen sometimes.”

Gilderman remembers another time as recently as about seven years ago. The new practice schedule came out and the Mirage were scheduled to practice at 8:30 p.m. after boys peewees and bantams.

“In 2015 … I was like ‘Are you kidding me?’” Gilderman said. “The scheduler was new and she didn’t know any better. She was like ‘I just figured.’ Well you figured wrong. These girls work just as hard if not harder than the boys. They shouldn’t be treated any less.”

Duluth Marshall eventually broke off and formed its own successful program. Gilderman retired as Mirage coach in February 2019 with a 322-219-22 record in 21 seasons with the Mirage. He said they finished close to .500 that first year in 1998-99 when they were still considered club level with early standouts such as Amy Kachinske who went on to play at Wisconsin-Superior.

The Mirage went 9-9-2 the next season and 15-8 in 2000-01 and were on their way.

“No regrets” Francisco said. “Glen was a great coach and (assistant) Bruce Bordson was another great coach. They taught me a lot about life other than just hockey.”

Francisco likes to joke she was just born 10 years too early. She was too competitive and skilled and talented to be part of that hodgepodge first unit no doubt but there she was seeing 75 or 80 shots some nights.

She was asked if she ever thought about quitting.

“I never would have quit. I’m not a quitter” Francisco said.

Despite all those differences Francisco discovered she belonged with the girls. Playing on boys teams and being a goalie she always felt a little bit like an outsider looking in. She even had to dress for games in broom closets because there were no locker rooms for one person.

Francisco said in just two short years playing with the girls a camaraderie formed — even in spite of her yelling.

“I was vocal” Francisco said. “I’m sure I made some of the girls on the team cry but I was used to playing on the boys teams. They would tell me what they thought and I would tell them what I thought but girls are a little more emotional (she laughed). It was kind of funny. We had a reunion a few years ago and I did apologize to a few of the girls like ‘Sorry.’ We just laugh about it now.”

No hard feelings.

“Definitely” she added. “That first year was tough but you’ve got to start somewhere.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hdC1taW5uZWFwb2xpcy01MHRoLXByaWRlLXBhcmFkZS1jYWxscy1mb3ItcG9saXRpY2FsLWFjdGl2aXNtLzYwMDE4NTQ4MS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At Twin Cities' 50th Pride parade calls for political activism,"Fifty years ago when gay rights activists organized their first Pride parade in Minneapolis just 50 people showed up — and half remained in Loring Park to bail out the others if they got arrested for marching.

Sunday more than 100000 people gathered on Hennepin Avenue to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the event. They were embraced by some of Minnesota's largest employers as well as a group of Democratic heavyweights who welcomed the crowds with a plea for political action in response to recent moves that they said threaten the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community.

Several pre-parade speakers denounced the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade noting that Justice Clarence Thomas proclaimed that the legal rationale for banning abortion should be used to overturn cases establishing rights to contraception same-sex consensual relations and same-sex marriage. The speakers urged attendees to get out and vote this fall for people who support their causes.

""They are coming for equality"" said Gov. Tim Walz who also marched in the parade next to Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan. ""They are coming for all of our rights. The good news is there's more of us. … The antidote to what we saw on Friday is you. It is all of our responsibility to create a world where every single child is seen heard loved and valued. Minnesota is that place.""

Andrea Jenkins president of the Minneapolis City Council warned the crowd that more than 300 anti-LGBTQ laws have been introduced throughout the U.S. recently with more than 100 of them passing in various states. She said conservatives are trying to legislate the LGBTQ community ""out of societal existence.""

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said the LGBTQ community has shown that it has political muscle of its own.

""Fifty years ago did we think we were going to have gay marriage? We did not"" Klobuchar told the crowd. ""Did we think we were going to get rid of things like 'Don't ask don't tell'? We did not. We have made so much progress. … This is a celebration of 50 years of progress but it is also a call for action for 50 more.""

Many crowd members said they welcomed the intrusion of politics on a day devoted to spreading messages of love inclusion and acceptance.

Pam Burd who has been coming to the Pride parade for 20 years said it was important for state leaders to show support for the LGBTQ community.

""I'm pretty disturbed by recent events"" said Burd who identifies as a gay woman. ""And I don't know what our future is. So I think our leaders need to be involved in everything that's going on.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was the most energetic politician on hand jogging down the route in shorts and pumping up the crowd outside Rock Bottom Brewery. In a call-and-responses session Frey shouted ""Happy!"" and the jubilant crowd shouted back ""Pride!""

Same-sex couples exchanged kisses and hugs sometimes on the route itself. The Timberwolves mascot drew huge cheers with his dance routine to Aretha Franklin's ""Respect."" The crowd also went delirious for bubbles and people sang along to a variety of hits.

""It was awesome"" said Tasia Desjarlait who brought her four kids to the parade for the first time. ""I feel great because the people going to the parade today feel free.""

Police said turnout was as large as before the pandemic. They reported no arrests or incidents related to the parade though a group of about 100 anti-police protesters briefly disrupted the beginning of the parade as they chanted ""No police at Pride"" and ""No justice no peace."" The group quickly moved to Loring Park organizers said.

The parade was an entertaining spectacle that lasted slightly more than two hours. Though it did not reach Mardi Gras levels there was a lot of exposed skin even though the weather never topped 70 degrees. One marcher wore nothing but a pair of white jockey shorts as he gyrated down Hennepin Avenue.

Still the parade was a fairly family-friendly event. Madusa Rose set up a face-painting station at 9th and Hennepin treating about 40 children to a free butterfly or other design. Rainbows symbolizing the LGBTQ flag were everywhere: on socks shirts capes dresses suits beads dogs — even rainbow-dyed hair.

Pat Meyer brought his three kids to the parade from St. Louis Park for the first time this year saying he did it to support his 13-year-old daughter who recently told the family she identifies as ""pansexual.""

""It opens up a lot of dialogues for us"" Meyer said while his two younger sons showed off their rainbow-colored gear. ""It's important for them to see there are no limitations to who you are.""

The parade drew some of Minnesota's biggest companies. A crew from Cargill carried signs saying ""We don't give a moo who you love"" and ""Labels are for jars not people."" Xcel Energy marched under a banner saying ""You. Us. Together."" Aveda workers wore T-shirts saying ""Be you. Do you.""
